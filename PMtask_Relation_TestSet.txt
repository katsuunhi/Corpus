9119005|t|Photoaffinity labeling analysis of the interaction of pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) with the PACAP type I receptor.
9119005|t|To identify residues and domains of the peptide hormone pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) that interact with the type I receptor, two photoreactive analogues of PACAP-(1-27)-peptide were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis. Phe6 or Tyr22 within the PACAP sequence were replaced by p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bz-Phe) thus creating two PACAP derivatives with a photoreactive amino acid in either the disordered N-terminal or the helical C-terminal part of the peptide. The ligand-binding properties and the efficiencies of these peptide analogues as photolabels were tested for pig brain PACAP receptors. [Bz-Phe6]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide (Kd 1.3 nM) retained the high binding affinity of PACAP-(1-27)-peptide (Kd 0.5 nM), wheras Bz-Phe substitution of Tyr22 reduced the affinity about tenfold (Kd 4.4 nM) thus demonstrating the importance of Tyr22 for receptor binding. Monoiodination of the photoreactive analogues did not change the binding affinity of the photoreactive analogues. Photoaffinity labeling using pig brain membrane demonstrated that the 125I-labeled photoreactive analogues specifically label a 66000-Mr protein band. Photoaffinity labeling of the rat brain PACAP receptor expressed in COS cells resulted in two specifically photolabeled proteins: a major band of Mr 58000 and a minor band of Mr 78000. By treatment of photolabeled membranes with N-glycosidase F, both of the polypeptide bands were converted to a single polypeptide band of Mr 54000, which corresponds to the deglycosylated PACAP receptor. Despite its lower receptor affinity, [Bz-Phe22]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide labeled the PACAP type I receptor in pig brain membranes and the rat receptor expressed in COS cells with much higher efficiency (20-fold for the pig receptor) than [Bz-Phe6]-PACAP-(1-27)-peptide. These findings suggest that Tyr22 in PACAP-(1-27)-peptide is located in or close to the hormone-binding site of the PACAP type I receptor. The results provide evidence that the alpha-helical C-terminal region of PACAP is directly involved in receptor binding.

8034624|t|Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity by Cdc42Hs binding to p85.
8034624|t|The Ras-like GTPase Cdc42 is essential for cell polarity and bud site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by regulating cell cycle-dependent reorganization of cortical cytoskeletal elements. However, its role in mammalian cells is unknown. To identify potential effectors of Cdc42Hs, we incubated lysates from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or PC12 cells with immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42Hs fusion proteins bound to different guanine nucleotides and observed a specific association between the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)-bound GST-Cdc42Hs. Recombinant p85 formed a complex with GTP gamma S-bound GST-Cdc42Hs and with a GTPase-defective GTP-bound GST-Cdc42Hs-Q61L mutant, but not with a GTP gamma S-bound, effector domain GST-Cdc42HsT35A mutant. Both the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85 and the Cdc42Hs-GAP competitively inhibited the binding of recombinant p85 to Cdc42Hs. In addition, PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-p85 antibody was stimulated 2-4-fold by GST-Cdc42-GTP gamma S. Similar interactions were observed between p85 and GST-Rac1-GTP gamma S but not between p85 and GST-RhoA-GTP gamma S. These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase, through the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85, can couple to the effector domain of Cdc42Hs and that p85 may be a target for the GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs and Rac1.

17689488|t|A Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy-associated missense mutation in mouse Tead1 affects its interaction with the co-factors YAP and TAZ.
17689488|t|Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy (SCRA) is an autosomal dominant eye disease characterized by bilateral chorioretinal degeneration. A missense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor TEAD1/TEF-1 (Y421H) is genetically linked to SCRA, but the mechanisms of pathology remain unclear. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying SCRA, a missense mutation corresponding to Y421H in human TEAD1 was introduced into mouse Tead1 (Y410H), and a functional analysis of the mutant protein was performed in RPE-J cells. The missense mutation reduced the ability of Tead1 to interact with the co-factors YAP and TAZ, but not with the co-factors Vgl-1, -2, and -3, in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. A GST pull-down assay showed that the direct interaction between Tead1 and YAP or TAZ was lost owing to the mutation. Amino acid substitutions at position 410 of Tead1 revealed the essentiality of this tyrosine residue to the interaction. The Y410H mutation also abolished the transcriptional activity of Tead1 under the co-expression of YAP or TAZ. These results suggest that SCRA pathogenesis may be due to a loss-of-function of TEAD1 affecting the regulation of its target genes.

12953057|t|Vps20p and Vta1p interact with Vps4p and function in multivesicular body sorting and endosomal transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
12953057|t|Vps4p (End13p) is an AAA-family ATPase that functions in membrane transport through endosomes, sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins to the vacuole, and multivesicular body (MVB) sorting of membrane proteins to the vacuole lumen. In a yeast two-hybrid screen with Vps4p as bait we isolated VPS20 (YMR077c) and the novel open reading frame YLR181c, for which the name VTA1 has recently been assigned (Saccharomyces Genome Database). Vps4p directly binds Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro and binding is not dependent on ATP - conversely, Vps4p binding to Vps20p is partially sensitive to ATP hydrolysis. Both ATP binding [Vps4p-(K179A)] and ATP hydrolysis [Vps4p-(E233Q)] mutant proteins exhibit enhanced binding to Vps20p and Vta1p in vitro. The Vps4p-Vps20p interaction involves the coiled-coil domain of each protein, whereas the Vps4p-Vta1p interaction involves the (non-coiled-coil) C-terminus of each protein. Deletion of either VPS20 (vps20Delta) or VTA1 (vta1Delta) leads to similar class E Vps- phenotypes resembling those of vps4Delta, including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) secretion, a block in ubiquitin-dependent MVB sorting, and a delay in both post-internalisation endocytic transport and biosynthetic transport to the vacuole. The vacuole resident membrane protein Sna3p (whose MVB sorting is ubiquitin-independent) does not appear to exit the class E compartment or reach the vacuole in cells lacking Vps20p, Vta1p or Vps4p, in contrast to other proteins whose delivery to the vacuole is only delayed. We propose that Vps20p and Vta1p regulate Vps4p function in vivo.

9777370|t|Biochemical characterization of mutant EGF receptors expressed in the hemopoietic cell line BaF/3.
9777370|t|The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor appears to require a fully active tyrosine kinase domain to transmit mitogenic signals. However, waved-2 mice carrying a mutation in the alpha-helix C of their EGF-R, which abolishes tyrosine kinase activity, only display a mild phenotype and are fully viable. This suggests that the mutant EGF-R signals through heterodimerization with endogenous, kinase active members of the EGF-R family such as ErbB-2 or ErbB-4. We have examined the biochemistry of EGF-Rs carrying mutations in the alpha-helix C of the human EGF-R (V741G and Y740F), in the ATP binding site (K721R) and at the C-terminus (CT957), by expression in BaF/3 cells which are devoid of EGF-R family members. The in vitro kinase activity of the alpha-helix C EGF-R mutants was severely impaired as a result of reduced phosphotransfer activity without appreciable changes in the affinity for either ATP or peptide substrate. Surprisingly, EGF stimulation of cells carrying the different mutant or wild type EGF-Rs resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R proteins; this phosphorylation was abolished in crude plasma membrane preparations, and appears to be due to activation of a membrane-associated or a cytosolic kinase. Receptor-mediated internalization of EGF was profoundly suppressed in the V741G, K721R and CT957 receptor mutant, and high affinity EGF binding was undetectable in the V741G and K721R receptors. We conclude that specific residues in the C-helix of the EGF-R kinase are essential for full kinase activity; mutations in this region do not affect ATP binding, but impair the receptors' phosphotransfer ability. High affinity binding of EGF is not dependent on tyrosine kinase activity or sequences in the C-terminus.

10358088|t|A single point mutation in a group I WW domain shifts its specificity to that of group II WW domains.
10358088|t|WW domains can be divided into three groups based on their binding specificity. By random mutagenesis, we switched the specificity of the Yes-associated protein (YAP) WW1 domain, a Group I WW domain, to that of the FE65 WW domain, which belongs to Group II. We showed that a single mutation, leucine 190 (betaB5) to tryptophan, is required to switch from Group I to Group II. Although this single substitution in YAP WW1 domain is sufficient to precipitate the two protein isoforms of Mena, an in vivo ligand of FE65, we showed that an additional substitution, histidine 192 (betaB7) to glycine, significantly increased the ability of YAP to mimic FE65. This double mutant (L190W/H192G) precipitates eight of the nine protein bands that FE65 pulls down from rat brain protein lysates. Based on both our data and a sequence comparison between Group I and Group II WW domains, we propose that a block of three consecutive aromatic amino acids within the second beta-sheet of the domain is required, but not always sufficient, for a WW domain to belong to Group II. These data deepen our understanding of WW domain binding specificity and provide a basis for the rational design of modified WW domains with potential therapeutic applications.

10561590|t|Identification of a CK2 phosphorylation site in mdm2.
10561590|t|Mdm2 is a cellular oncoprotein the most obvious function of which is the down-regulation of the growth suppressor protein p53. It represents a highly phosphorylated protein but only little is yet known about the sites phosphorylated in vivo, the kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation or the functional relevance of the phosphorylation status. Recently, we have shown that mdm2 is a good substrate for protein kinase CK2 at least in vitro. Computer analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of mdm2 revealed 19 putative CK2 phosphorylation sites. By using deletion mutants of mdm2 and a peptide library we identified the serine residue at position 269 which lies within a canonical CK2 consensus sequence (EGQELSDEDDE) as the most important CK2 phosphorylation site. Moreover, by using the mdm2 S269A mutant for in vitro phosphorylation assays this site was shown to be phosphorylated by CK2. Binding studies revealed that phosphorylation of mdm2 at S269 does not have any influence on the binding of p53 to mdm2.

12368318|t|Mutations conferring resistance to neutralization by a soluble form of the neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) map outside of the known antigenic sites of the rabies virus glycoprotein.
12368318|t|The neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) serves as a receptor for rabies virus (RV). We expressed and purified a soluble chimera consisting of the p75NTR ectodomain fused to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment (p75-Fc). Although p75-Fc interacts with RV, the infectivity of RV did not decrease significantly when it was incubated in the presence of the soluble receptor alone. However, when it was subsequently incubated with an antihuman IgG directed against the Fc fragment of p75-Fc, the infectivity of RV was significantly lowered (>90%), whereas incubation with antihuman IgG alone had no effect. We then selected eight independent RV mutants that were not neutralized by p75-Fc and antihuman IgG (srr [soluble receptor resistant] mutants). Each mutant carried a single mutation in the glycoprotein gene leading to one amino acid substitution in the protein. A total of four different substitutions were found. Two of the mutations were located at position 318 (phenylalanine replaced by a serine or a valine residue), and two were located at position 352 (histidine replaced by a tyrosine or an arginine residue). All of the mutations prevented the interaction with p75NTR as either a soluble or a membrane-anchored form. Two mutants (F318S) and (H352R) resulted in the formation of small plaques on BSR cells, probably due to the slower maturation of the glycoprotein. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and neutralization assays showed that the four mutated glycoproteins still interacted with representative anti-RV glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), indicating that p75NTR binds outside of the known RV glycoprotein antigenic sites.

10889020|t|Mapping the bimolecular interface of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-PTH1 receptor complex: spatial proximity between Lys(27) (of the hormone principal binding domain) and leu(261) (of the first extracellular loop) of the human PTH1 receptor.
10889020|t|In an effort to characterize the bimolecular interface between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its human receptor PTH1-Rc (hPTH1-Rc), we previously identified two contact sites in the receptor: one for position 1 and another for position 13 (located at the ends of the principal activation domain) in PTH(1-34). The present study reports a third, novel "contact site" between hPTH1-Rc and Lys(27) of PTH(1-34). Lys(27) is located in the principal binding domain of the hormone (residues 25-34). The photoreactive PTH(1-34) analogue K27 contains a benzophenone (BP) moiety on Lys(27). The analogue binds to stably transfected HEK 293/C-21 cells (which express a high level of recombinant hPTH1-Rc) and stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity with a potency similar to PTH(1-34). In addition, (125)I-K27 cross-links effectively and specifically to the hPTH1-Rc. Enzymatic (Glu-C and Lys-C) and chemical (CNBr and BNPS-skatole) digestions of the photoconjugate between (125)I-K27 and hPTH1-Rc were performed. In addition, photoconjugates involving the bioactive mutants [L261M]- and [R262K]-hPTH1-Rc, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, were also digested. The data obtained clearly identify L(261) or R(262) of the first extracellular loop of hPTH1-Rc as the contact site for Lys(27) in the hormone. On the basis of (i) the similarity in molecular mass between the CNBr digest of the (125)I-K27-[L261M]hPTH1-Rc conjugate and free (125)I-K27 and (ii) the failure to cross-link (125)I-K27 to a bioactive mutant receptor [L261A]hPTH1-Rc, we conclude that L(261) is the cross-linking site. These results provide the first demonstration of an interaction between the principal binding domain of PTH and the first extracellular loop of hPTH1-Rc. Revealing proximity of Lys(27) (in PTH) to L(261) (in hPTH1-Rc) provides additional insight into the nature of the ligand-receptor bimolecular interface and clearly illustrates that the extracellular loops of the receptor contribute to the specificity of the PTH-PTH1-Rc interaction. Taken together with previous studies, the new findings add important constraints on the possible positioning of the C-terminal helix of PTH (which contains the principal binding domain) relative to the first extracellular loop and the distal C-terminal helix of the large extracellular amino terminal domain of the PTH1-Rc.

15523651|t|Functional characterization of SIX3 homeodomain mutations in holoprosencephaly: interaction with the nuclear receptor NR4A3/NOR1.
15523651|t|Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a relatively common brain malformation resulting in an incomplete separation of the two cerebral hemispheres. A number of mutations in different genes have been linked to this malformation, including three missense mutations in the homeodomain of the transcription factor SIX3. In this study, we investigated the functional consequences of these SIX3 mutations with respect to the ability of the protein to interact with and stimulate the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor NOR1 (NR4A3). Using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays and transient cotransfections of Neuro-2a cells with expression and reporter vectors, we found that one mutation, c.676C>G (p.L226V), does not alter the properties of SIX3 toward NOR1. Another mutation, c.749T>C (p.V250A), results in the production of a highly unstable protein in Neuro-2a cells. The third mutation, c.770G>C (p.R257P), results in a mutant SIX3 protein that no longer interacts with NOR1 in vivo. These observations suggest that different SIX3 mutations in HPE2 may affect different signaling pathways, and that one of these pathways may involve the nuclear receptor NOR1.

24956593|t|14-3-3ζ regulates nuclear trafficking of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) in HEK-293 cells.
24956593|t|Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases in mammalian cells. There are four isoforms of PP1 namely, PP1α, PP1β/δ, PP1γ1 and PP1γ2. PP1γ and PP1β translocate to the nucleus by binding to a co-transporter that contains a nuclear localization signal. The mechanism by which PP1α shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol is not known. In this study, we found that PP1α co-immunoprecipitates with 14-3-3ζ from HEK-293 cell lysates. By co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay, we determined that 14-3-3ζ binds to both PP1α (WT) and PP1α (T320A), and that phosphorylation of PP1α is not required for binding. Using PP1α deletion mutants, we located the 14-3-3ζ binding region within PP1α residues 159-279. An in vitro assay showed that 14-3-3ζ does not affect PP1α activity. When HEK-293 cells expressing PP1α and 14-3-3ζ were subjected to subcellular fractionation, the ratio of cytosolic vs. nuclear PP1α was significantly higher in cells expressing PP1α and 14-3-3ζ than those expressing PP1α alone. In cells expressing a dominant negative 14-3-3ζ (K49E), PP1α accumulated in the nucleus. Our results show that 14-3-3ζ binds to PP1α and causes its retention in the cytosol which suggests that 14-3-3ζ regulates nuclear trafficking of PP1α in mammalian cells.

11170396|t|Identification of a motif in the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 that is involved in adaptin 2 binding and receptor internalization.
11170396|t|Agonist treatment of cells expressing the chemokine receptor, CXCR2, induces receptor phosphorylation and internalization through a dynamin-dependent mechanism. In the present study, we demonstrate that a carboxyl terminus-truncated mutant of CXCR2 (331T), which no longer undergoes agonist-induced phosphorylation, continues to undergo ligand-induced internalization in HEK293 cells. This mutant receptor exhibits reduced association with beta-arrestin 1 but continues to exhibit association with adaptin 2 alpha and beta subunits. Replacing Leu320-321 and/or Ile323-Leu324 with Ala (LL320,321AA, IL323,324AA, and LLIL320,321,323,324AAAA) in wild-type CXCR2 or 331T causes little change in ligand binding and signaling through Ca(2+) mobilization but greatly impairs the agonist-induced receptor sequestration and ligand-mediated chemotaxis. The LL320,321AA, IL323,324AA, and LLIL320,321,323,324AAAA mutants of CXCR2 exhibit normal binding to beta-arrestin 1 but exhibit decreased binding to adaptin 2alpha and beta. These data demonstrate a role for the LLKIL motif in the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 in receptor internalization and cell chemotaxis and imply a role for adaptin 2 in the endocytosis of CXCR2.

14699067|t|A single amino acid change (Asp 53 --> Ala53) converts Survivin from anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic.
14699067|t|Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family that has been implicated in both apoptosis inhibition and cell cycle control. Recently, Survivin has attracted growing attention because of its tumor-specific expression and potential applications in tumor therapy. However, its inhibitory mechanism and subcellular localization remain controversial. Here, we report a novel Survivin mutant Surv-D53A, which displays a function opposite to Survivin and a distinctive subcellular distribution compared with its wild-type counterpart. Surv-D53A was shown to induce apoptosis in a p53-independent manner, indicating that tumor suppressor p53 is not involved in its apoptosis pathway. Surv-D53A was shown to markedly sensitize apoptosis induced by TRAIL, doxorubicin, and RIP3. We also demonstrated that similar to wild-type Survivin, Surv-D53A was localized in cytoplasm in interphase and to midbody at telophase. However, it fails to colocalize in chromosomes with Aurora-B in metaphase as wt-Survivin. Surv-D53A mutant is less stable than wt-Survivin and is degraded more rapidly by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Additionally, we found that Surv-D53A interacts with wt-Survivin to form heterodimer or with itself to form mutant homodimer, which may account for the loss of its antiapoptotic function. Finally, unlike Survivin*Survivin, neither Surv-D53A*Survivin nor Surv-D53A*Surv-D53A is able to bind to Smac/DIABLO, which may explain the underlying mechanism for its abolishment of antiapoptotic activity of Survivin.

14645919|t|Identification of protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen leader protein at serine-35, which regulates its coactivator function.
14645919|t|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP) is a phosphoprotein suggested to play important roles in EBV-induced immortalization. Earlier studies have shown that the major site of phosphorylation of EBNA-LP by cellular kinase(s) is a serine residue at position 35 (Ser-35) and that the phosphorylation of Ser-35 is critical for regulation of the coactivator function of EBNA-LP (Yokoyama et al., J Virol 75, 5119-5128, 2001). In the present study, we have attempted to identify protein kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. A purified chimeric protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to a domain of EBNA-LP containing Ser-35 was found to be specifically phosphorylated by purified cdc2 in vitro, while GST fused to a mutated domain of EBNA-LP in which Ser-35 was replaced with alanine was not. In addition, overexpression of cdc2 in mammalian cells caused a significant increase in the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP, while this increased phosphorylation was eliminated if Ser-35 of EBNA-LP was replaced with alanine. These results indicate that the cellular protein kinase cdc2 mediates the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. Recently, we reported that cdc2 and conserved protein kinases encoded by herpesviruses phosphorylate the same amino acid residue of target proteins (Kawaguchi et al., J Virol 77, 2359-2368, 2003). Consistent with this, the EBV-encoded conserved protein kinase BGLF4 specifically mediated the phosphorylation of EBNA-LP at Ser-35. These results indicate that the coactivator function of EBNA-LP can be regulated by the activity of these cellular and viral protein kinases.

11136978|t|Ras activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is important for survival of transformed cells. We find that PI3Kgamma is strongly and directly activated by H-Ras G12V in vivo or by GTPgammaS-loaded H-Ras in vitro. We have determined a crystal structure of a PI3Kgamma/Ras.GMPPNP complex. A critical loop in the Ras binding domain positions Ras so that it uses its switch I and switch II regions to bind PI3Kgamma. Mutagenesis shows that interactions with both regions are essential for binding PI3Kgamma. Ras also forms a direct contact with the PI3Kgamma catalytic domain. These unique Ras/PI3Kgamma interactions are likely to be shared by PI3Kalpha. The complex with Ras shows a change in the PI3K conformation that may represent an allosteric component of Ras activation.

18635949|t|Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is expressed abundantly in neurons and has been reported to be a major target of oxidative/carbonyl damage associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). The I93M mutation in UCH-L1 is also associated with familial PD. We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and Hsc70 and Hsp90, both of which can function as components of the CMA pathway. We found that the levels of these interactions were aberrantly increased by the I93M mutation, and that expression of I93M UCH-L1 in cells induced the CMA inhibition-associated increase in the amount of alpha-synuclein, a risk factor for PD. The interactions of UCH-L1 with LAMP-2A, Hsc70 and Hsp90 were also abnormally enhanced by carbonyl modification of UCH-L1. We propose that aberrant interactions of UCH-L1 variants with CMA machinery, at least partly, underlie the pathogenesis of I93M UCH-L1-associated PD, and possibly of sporadic PD. Our findings may provide novel insights into the links between familial and sporadic PD.

26672965|t|TRAIL-R2 Superoligomerization Induced by Human Monoclonal Agonistic Antibody KMTR2.
26672965|t|The fully human monoclonal antibody KMTR2 acts as a strong direct agonist for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2), which is capable of inducing apoptotic cell death without cross-linking. To investigate the mechanism of direct agonistic activity induced by KMTR2, the crystal structure of the extracellular region of TRAIL-R2 and a Fab fragment derived from KMTR2 (KMTR2-Fab) was determined to 2.1 Å resolution. Two KMTR2-Fabs assembled with the complementarity-determining region 2 of the light chain via two-fold crystallographic symmetry, suggesting that the KMTR2-Fab assembly tended to enhance TRAIL-R2 oligomerization. A single mutation at Asn53 to Arg located at the two-fold interface in the KMTR2 resulted in a loss of its apoptotic activity, although it retained its antigen-binding activity. These results indicate that the strong agonistic activity, such as apoptotic signaling and tumor regression, induced by KMTR2 is attributed to TRAIL-R2 superoligomerization induced by the interdimerization of KMTR2.

8798490|t|Identification of the Rho-binding domain of p160ROCK, a Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase.
8798490|t|A protein serine/threonine kinase, p160(ROCK), has been identified as a putative Rho target protein that is activated when bound to the GTP-bound form of the small GTPase Rho (Ishizaki, T., Maekawa, M., Fujisawa, K., Okawa, K., Iwamatu, A., Fujita, A., Watanabe, N. Saito, Y., Kakizuka, A., Morii, N., and Narumiya, S. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 1885-1893). p160(ROCK) has a serine/threonine kinase domain in its NH2-terminal region, followed by an approximately 600-amino acid-long alpha-helix, a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif, and a pleckstrin homology region in the COOH terminus. To identify the Rho binding domain of this protein, we divided p160 into five fragments, expressed each as a His-tagged recombinant protein, and performed a ligand overlay assay using [35S]guanosine-5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS)-bound glutathione S-transferase-RhoA. Specific GTPgammaS-Rho binding was observed only in the fragment M2, which covered most of the carboxyl half of the alpha-helix between amino acids 727 and 1021. This fragment was further subdivided into several fragments, and the ligand overlay assay as well as the yeast two hybrid system was carried out to identify the Rho-binding region. These studies localized the minimum Rho binding region to amino acids 934-1015. To identify critical amino acids for Rho binding, we analyzed the Rho binding activity of the subfragment with various point mutations. This analysis revealed that K934M, L941A, and E1008A mutations significantly weakened Rho binding and an I1009A mutation abolished Rho binding. The amino acid sequence in this region had no significant homology with Rho effector motif class 1, which is shared by putative Rho targets, PKN, rhophilin, and rhotekin, (Reid, T., Furuyashiki, T., Ishizaki, T., Watanabe, G., Watanabe, N., Fujisawa, K., Morii, N., Madaule, P., and Narumiya, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 13556-13560) and may define a distinct class of Rho effector motif.

11520787|t|The Fanconi anemia complementation group C gene product: structural evidence of multifunctionality.
11520787|t|The Fanconi anemia (FA) group C gene product (FANCC) functions to protect cells from cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of cross-linking agents. FANCC is also required for optimal activation of STAT1 in response to cytokine and growth factors and for suppressing cytokine-induced apoptosis by modulating the activity of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. Because not all FANCC mutations affect STAT1 activation, the hypothesis was considered that cross-linker resistance function of FANCC depends on structural elements that differ from those required for the cytokine signaling functions of FANCC. Structure-function studies were designed to test this notion. Six separate alanine-substituted mutations were generated in 3 highly conserved motifs of FANCC. All mutants complemented mitomycin C (MMC) hypersensitive phenotype of FA-C cells and corrected aberrant posttranslational activation of FANCD2 in FA-C mutant cells. However, 2 of the mutants, S249A and E251A, failed to correct defective STAT1 activation. FA-C lymphoblasts carrying these 2 mutants demonstrated a defect in recruitment of STAT1 to the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor and GST-fusion proteins bearing S249A and E251A mutations were less efficient binding partners for STAT1 in stimulated lymphoblasts. These same mutations failed to complement the characteristic hypersensitive apoptotic responses of FA-C cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IFN-gamma. Cells bearing a naturally occurring FANCC mutation (322delG) that preserves this conserved region showed normal STAT1 activation but remained hypersensitive to MMC. The conclusion is that a central highly conserved domain of FANCC is required for functional interaction with STAT1 and that structural elements required for STAT1-related functions differ from those required for genotoxic responses to cross-linking agents. Preservation of signaling capacity of cells bearing the del322G mutation may account for the reduced severity and later onset of bone marrow failure associated with this mutation.

20303977|t|The effects of phosphomimetic lid mutation on the thermostability of the N-terminal domain of MDM2.
20303977|t|The multidomain E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 catalyzes p53 ubiquitination by a "dual-site" docking mechanism whereby MDM2 binding to at least two distinct peptide motifs on p53 promotes ubiquitination. One protein-protein interaction occurs between the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and the transactivation motif of p53, and the second interaction occurs between the acidic domain of MDM2 and a motif in the DNA-binding domain of p53. A flexible N-terminal pseudo-substrate or "lid" adjacent to the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 has a phosphorylation site, and there are distinct models proposed on how the phosphorylated lid could affect MDM2 function. Biochemical studies have predicted that phosphomimetic mutation will stabilize the lid on the surface of MDM2 and will "open" the hydrophobic pocket and stabilize the MDM2-p53 complex, while NMR studies proposed that phosphomimetic mutation "closes" the lid over the MDM2 pocket and inhibits MDM2-p53 complex formation. To resolve these discrepancies, we utilized a quantitative fluorescence-based dye binding assay to measure the thermal unfolding of wild-type (wt), DeltaLid, and S17D N-terminal domains of MDM2 as a function of increasing ligand concentration. Our data reveal that S17D lid mutation increases, rather than decreases, the thermostability of the N-terminal domain of MDM2 in the absence or in the presence of ligand. DeltaLid mutation, by contrast, increases MDM2 thermoinstability. This is consistent with biochemical data, using full-length MDM2, showing that the S17D mutation stabilizes the MDM2-p53 complex and increases the specific activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2. These data indicate that phosphomimetic lid mutation results in an "opening," rather than a "closing," of the pocket of MDM2 and highlight the ability of small intrinsically disordered or unstructured peptide motifs to regulate the specific activity of a protein.

24297439|t|Sck1 negatively regulates Gpa2-mediated glucose signaling in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
24297439|t|Schizosaccharomyces pombe detects extracellular glucose via a G protein-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP)-signaling pathway activating protein kinase A (PKA) and regulating transcription of genes involved in metabolism and sexual development. In this pathway, Gpa2 Gα binds to and activates adenylyl cyclase in response to glucose detection by the Git3 G protein-coupled receptor. Using a two-hybrid screen to identify extrinsic regulators of Gpa2, we isolated a clone that expresses codons 471 to 696 of the Sck1 kinase, which appears to display a higher affinity for Gpa2(K270E)-activated Gα relative to Gpa2(+) Gα. Deletion of sck1(+) or mutational inactivation of the Sck1 kinase produces phenotypes reflecting increased PKA activity in strains expressing Gpa2(+) or Gpa2(K270E), suggesting that Sck1 negatively regulates PKA activation through Gpa2. In contrast to the Gpa2(K270E) GDP-GTP exchange rate mutant, GTPase-defective Gpa2(R176H) weakly binds Sck1 in the two-hybrid screen and a deletion of sck1(+) in a Gpa2(R176H) strain confers phenotypes consistent with a slight reduction in PKA activity. Finally, deleting sck1(+) in a gpa2Δ strain results in phenotypes consistent with a second role for Sck1 acting in parallel with PKA. In addition to this parallel role with PKA, our data suggest that Sck1 negatively regulates Gpa2, possibly targeting the nucleotide-free form of the protein that may expose the one and only AKT/PKB consensus site in Gpa2 for Sck1 to bind. This dual role for Sck1 may allow S. pombe to produce distinct biological responses to glucose and nitrogen starvation signals that both activate the Wis1-Spc1/StyI stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway.

8805302|t|Point mutations in the alpha 2 domain of HLA-A2.1 define a functionally relevant interaction with TAP.
8805302|t|BACKGROUND: Glycoproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex class I region (MHC class I) present peptide antigens to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Peptides are delivered to the site of MHC class I assembly by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and cell lines that lack this transporter are unable to present endogenous antigens to CTLs. Although it has been shown that a fraction of newly synthesized class I molecules are in physical association with TAP, it is not known whether this interaction is functionally relevant, or where on the class I molecule the TAP binding site might be. RESULTS: C1R cells transfected with a mutant HLA-A2.1 heavy chain (HC), where threonine at position 134 in the alpha 2 domain is changed to lysine (T134K), are unable to present endogenous antigens to CTLs. We have studied the biochemistry of this mutant in C1R cells, and found that a large pool of unstable empty class I HC-beta 2m (beta-2 microglobulin) heterodimers exist that are rapidly transported to the cell surface. The T134K mutant seemed to bind peptide antigens and assemble with beta 2m as efficiently as wild-type HLA-A2.1. However, we show here that the inefficiency with which T134K presents intracellular antigen is associated with its inability to interact with the TAP heterodimer. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments establish that the class I-TAP interaction is obligatory for the presentation of peptide epitopes delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by TAP. Wild-type HLA-A2.1 molecules in TAP-deficient cells are retained in the ER, whereas T134K is rapidly released to the cell surface, but is unstable, suggesting a role for the TAP complex as an intracellular checkpoint that only affects the release of class I molecules with stably bound peptide ligands.

9642250|t|Evidence for a ligand interaction site at the amino-terminus of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein receptor from cross-linking and mutational studies.
9642250|t|Low resolution mutational studies have indicated that the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the rat parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptor (rP1R) interacts with the carboxyl-terminal portion of PTH-(1-34) or PTHrP-(1-36). To further define ligand-receptor interactions, we prepared a fully functional photoreactive analog of PTHrP, [Ile5,Bpa23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1-36)-amide ([Bpa23]PTHrP, where Bpa is p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine). Upon photolysis, radioiodinated [Bpa23]PTHrP covalently and specifically bound to the rP1R. CNBr cleavage of the broad approximately 80-kDa complex yielded a radiolabeled approximately 9-kDa non-glycosylated protein band that could potentially be assigned to rP1R residues 23-63, Tyr23 being the presumed amino-terminus of the receptor. This assignment was confirmed using a mutant rP1R (rP1R-M63I) that yielded, upon photoligand binding and CNBr digestion, a broad protein band of approximately 46 kDa, which was reduced to a sharp band of approximately 20 kDa upon deglycosylation. CNBr digestion of complexes formed with two additional rP1R double mutants (rP1R-M63I/L40M and rP1R-M63I/L41M) yielded non-glycosylated protein bands that were approximately 6 kDa in size, indicating that [Bpa23]PTHrP cross-links to amino acids 23-40 of the rP1R. This segment overlaps a receptor region previously identified by deletion mapping to be important for ligand binding. Alanine scanning of this region revealed two residues, Thr33 and Gln37, as being functionally involved in ligand binding. Thus, the convergence of photoaffinity cross-linking and mutational data demonstrates that the extreme amino-terminus of the rP1R participates in ligand binding.

12215524|t|Isolation and characterization of new proliferating cell nuclear antigen (POL30) mutator mutants that are defective in DNA mismatch repair.
12215524|t|A number of studies have suggested a role for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). However, the majority of mutations in the POL30 gene encoding PCNA that cause MMR defects also cause replication and other repair defects that contribute to the increased mutation rate caused by these mutations. Here, 20 new pol30 mutants were identified and screened for MMR and other defects, resulting in the identification of two mutations, pol30-201 and pol30-204, that appear to cause MMR defects but little if any other defects. The pol30-204 mutation altered an amino acid (C81R) in the monomer-monomer interface region and resulted in a partial general MMR defect and a defect in MSH2-MSH6 binding in vitro. The pol30-201 mutation altered an amino acid (C22Y) located on the surface of the PCNA trimer that slides over the DNA but did not cause a defect in MSH2-MSH6 binding in vitro. The pol30-201 mutation caused an intermediate mutator phenotype. However, the pol30-201 mutation caused almost a complete defect in the repair of AC and GT mispairs and only a small defect in the repair of a "+T" insertion, an effect similar to that caused by an msh6Delta mutation, indicating that pol30-201 primarily effects MSH6-dependent MMR. The chromosomal double mutant msh3-FF>AA msh6-FF>AA eliminating the conserved FF residues of the PCNA interacting motif of these proteins caused a small (<10%) defect in MMR but showed synergistic interactions with mutations in POL30, indicating that the FF>AA substitution may not eliminate PCNA interactions in vivo. These results indicate that the interaction between PCNA and MMR proteins is more complex than was previously appreciated.

12446613|t|A role for Grb2-associated binder-1 in growth hormone signaling.
12446613|t|GH signaling begins with activation of the GH receptor (GHR)-associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase-2. GH-induced Janus kinase-2 activation leads to engagement of several signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) pathways. Previous work suggests that ERK activation in response to GH may be modulated by several proteins acting as docking molecules, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin receptor substrate-1. In this study we investigate potential roles for the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing insulin receptor substrate-like protein, Grb-2-associated binder-1 (Gab1), in GH signaling. We find in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes that GH promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with SHP2, an Src homology 2-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase. The Grb2 adapter protein, in contrast, is specifically coimmunoprecipitated with Gab1, even in the absence of GH exposure. Using a COS-7 cell transient reconstitution system, we observed that GH-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on the Gab1 PH domain, whereas GH-induced coimmunoprecipitation of SHP2 requires tyrosine 627 of Gab1, as previously reported for EGF-induced Gab1-SHP2 association. Deletion of the Gab1 PH domain significantly attenuates GH-induced ERK activation and trans-activation of a c-fos enhancer-driven reporter construct compared with wild-type Gab1 in this system. In contrast, GH-induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and STAT5-dependent trans-activation are similar in cells expressing wild-type or PH domain-deleted Gab1. Notably, neither the ERK nor the STAT5 GH-dependent signaling outcome is affected by expression of the Gab1 mutant with tyrosine 627 changed to phenylalanine. Finally, we observed GH-dependent translocation of a wild-type, but not a PH domain-deleted, Gab1-green fluorescent protein chimera from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Our results suggest selective involvement of Gab1 in GH-induced ERK activation and implicate the Gab1 PH domain as critical in this involvement.

10191253|t|Methylated C-terminal leucine residue of PP2A catalytic subunit is important for binding of regulatory Balpha subunit.
10191253|t|Methylation of the C-terminal leucine residue (Leu309) of protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC) is known to regulate catalytic activity in vitro, but the functional consequence(s) of this post-translational modification in the context of the cell remain unclear. Alkali-induced demethylation of PP2AC in purified PP2A heterotrimer (ABalphaC), but not in purified PP2A heterodimer (AC), indicated that a larger fraction of PP2AC is carboxymethylated in ABalphaC than in AC. To explore the role of Leu309 in PP2A holoenzyme assembly, epitope-tagged PP2A catalytic subunit (HA-PP2A) and a mutant of HA-PP2A containing an alanine residue in place of Leu309 (HA-PP2A-L309A) were transiently expressed in COS cells. Both recombinant proteins exhibited serine/threonine phosphatase activity when immunoisolated from COS cell extracts. HA-PP2A, but not HA-PP2A-L309A, was carboxymethylated in vitro. A chromatographic analysis of cell extracts indicated that most endogenous PP2AC and HA-PP2A were co-eluted with the A and Balpha regulatory subunits of PP2A, whereas most HA-PP2A-L309A seemed to elute with the A subunit as a smaller complex or, alternatively, as free catalytic (C) subunit. The A subunit co-immunoisolated with both tagged proteins; however, substantially less Balpha subunit co-immunoisolated with HA-PP2A-L309A than with HA-PP2A. These results demonstrate that the reversibly methylated C-terminal leucine residue of PP2AC is important for Balpha regulatory subunit binding. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for an interrelationship between PP2AC carboxymethylation and PP2A holoenzyme assembly.

16081517|t|Mutation of histidine 874 in the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain leads to promiscuous ligand activation and altered p160 coactivator interactions.
16081517|t|The androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is a major therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate cancer. The AR functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor in the presence of the cognate hormone ligands testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). We have characterized a highly conserved sequence at the C-terminal end of helix 10/11 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is prone to receptor point mutations in prostate cancer. This sequence includes threonine 877 that is involved in hydrogen bonding to the D ring of the steroid molecule and leads to promiscuous ligand activation of the AR when mutated to alanine or serine. A second mutation in this region, H874Y, also results in a receptor protein that has broadened ligand-binding specificity, but retains an affinity for DHT (K(d) = 0.77 nm) similar to that of the wild-type receptor. The structure of the mutant LBD, expressed in Escherichia coli, is not dramatically altered compared with the wild-type AR-LBD in the presence of DHT, but shows a modestly increased sensitivity to protease digestion in the absence of hormone. This mutant AR showed wild-type AR-LBD/N-terminal domain interactions, but significantly enhanced binding and transactivation activity with all three members of the p160 family of coactivator proteins. Together, these phenotypic changes are likely to confer a selective advantage for tumor cells in a low androgen environment resulting from hormone therapy.

9312046|t|Sequential activation of phoshatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase C-gamma2 by the M-CSF receptor is necessary for differentiation signaling.
9312046|t|Binding of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to its receptor (Fms) induces dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor, resulting in autophosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues used as docking sites for SH2-containing signaling proteins that relay growth and development signals. To determine whether a distinct signaling pathway is responsible for the Fms differentiation signal versus the growth signal, we sought new molecules involved in Fms signaling by performing a two-hybrid screen in yeast using the autophosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of the wild-type Fms receptor as bait. Clones containing SH2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) were frequently isolated and shown to interact with phosphorylated Tyr721 of the Fms receptor, which is also the binding site of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). At variance with previous reports, M-CSF induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2 in myeloid FDC-P1 cells and this activation required the activity of the PI3-kinase pathway. The Fms Y721F mutation strongly decreased this activation. Moreover, the Fms Y807F mutation decreased both binding and phosphorylation of PLC-gamma2 but not that of p85. Since the Fms Y807F mutation abrogates the differentiation signal when expressed in FDC-P1 cells and since this phenotype could be reproduced by a specific inhibitor of PLC-gamma, we propose that a balance between the activities of PLC-gamma2 and PI3-kinase in response to M-CSF is required for cell differentiation.

16756945|t|Mutant Tie2 causing venous malformation signals through Shc.
16756945|t|Tie2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed predominantly in endothelial cells. A missense mutation in the intracellular domain of Tie2 resulting in an arginine to tryptophan substitution causes an inherited form of vascular dysmorphogenesis, venous malformation (VM). The signalling pathways activated by mutant Tie2 and responsible for formation and maintenance of the abnormal vessels in VM are not known. In this study, we have sought to define these pathways by identifying phosphoproteins interacting with mutant Tie2 expressed in endothelial cells. We find R849W Tie2 is constitutively active in endothelium and recruits and phosphorylates a 52 kDa protein. This protein is identified as p52 ShcA. We show endothelial cells expressing VM-mutant Tie2 are protected from cell death and expression of dominant-negative ShcA inhibits the anti-apoptotic activity of the mutant receptor. Suppression of this pro-survival signalling could be a therapeutic option for inducing regression of lesional vessels.

20615419|t|Specificity for homooligomer versus heterooligomer formation in integrin transmembrane helices.
20615419|t|Transmembrane (TM) helices engage in homomeric and heteromeric interactions that play essential roles in the folding and assembly of TM proteins. However, features that explain their propensity to interact homomerically or heteromerically and determine the strength of these interactions are poorly understood. Integrins provide an ideal model system for addressing these questions because the TM helices of full-length integrins interact heteromerically when integrins are inactive, but isolated TM helices are also able to form homodimers or homooligomers in micelles and bacterial membranes. We sought to determine the features defining specificity for homointeractions versus heterointeractions by conducting a comprehensive comparison of the homomeric and heteromeric interactions of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 TM helices in biological membranes. Using the TOXCAT assay, we found that residues V700, M701, A703, I704, L705, G708, L709, L712, and L713, which are located on the same face of the beta3 helix, mediate homodimer formation. We then characterized the beta3 heterodimer by measuring the ability of beta3 helix mutations to cause ligand binding to alphaIIbbeta3. We found that mutating V696, L697, V700, M701, A703. I704, L705, G708, L712, and L713, but not the small residue-X(3)-small residue motif S699-X(3)-A703, caused constitutive alphaIIbbeta3 activation, as well as persistent focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation dependent on alphaIIbbeta3 activation. Because alphaIIb and beta3 use the same face of their respective TM helices for homomeric and heteromeric interactions, the interacting surface on each has an intrinsic "stickiness" predisposing towards helix-helix interactions in membranes. The residues responsible for heterodimer formation comprise a network of interdigitated side chains with considerable geometric complementarity; mutations along this interface invariably destabilize heterodimer formation. By contrast, residues responsible for homomeric interactions are dispersed over a wider surface. While most mutations of these residues are destabilizing, some stabilized homooligomer formation. We conclude that the alphaIIbbeta3 TM heterodimer shows the hallmark of finely tuned heterodimeric interaction, while homomeric interaction is less specific.

15618221|t|TTK/hMps1 participates in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint response by phosphorylating CHK2 on threonine 68.
15618221|t|CHK2/hCds1 plays important roles in the DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating several important targets, such as Cdc25 and p53. To obtain a better understanding of the CHK2 signaling pathway, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for potential CHK2-interacting proteins. Here, we report the identification of the mitotic checkpoint kinase, TTK/hMps1, as a novel CHK2-interacting protein. TTK/hMps1 directly phosphorylates CHK2 on Thr-68 in vitro. Expression of a TTK kinase-dead mutant, TTK(D647A), interferes with the G(2)/M arrest induced by either ionizing radiation or UV light. Interestingly, induction of CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation and of several downstream events, such as cyclin B1 accumulation and Cdc2 Tyr-15 phosphorylation, is also affected. Furthermore, ablation of TTK expression using small interfering RNA results not only in reduced CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation, but also in impaired growth arrest. Our results are consistent with a model in which TTK functions upstream from CHK2 in response to DNA damage and suggest possible cross-talk between the spindle assembly checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint.

20055437|t|Biochemical analysis of phenotypic diversity associated with mutations in codon 244 of the retinal degeneration slow gene.
20055437|t|Mutations in the protein product of the retinal degeneration slow (RDS) gene cause both rod-dominant retinitis pigmentosa and different forms of cone-dominant macular dystrophies. In particular, mutations in codon 244 can cause either of these types of disease. In this study, we examine the biochemical effects of N244H and N244K in an effort to understand the mechanism underlying rod- and cone-dominant defects, respectively. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with either wild-type (WT) RDS or RDS containing an N244H or N244K mutation along with its binding partner, ROM-1 (rod outer segment membrane protein 1). Cell extracts were analyzed for mutant protein stability by Western blot, and localization was examined by immunocytochemistry. Interactions between transfected proteins were assessed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, and nonreducing velocity sedimentation was used to identify the pattern of RDS complex assembly. Interactions were confirmed using GST fusion constructs of WT and mutant RDS in GST pull-down assays from WT mouse retinal extract. In COS-1 cells, recombinant N244H RDS had a weakened ability to assemble into higher-order complexes but retained the ability to co-immunoprecipitate with ROM-1 as well as localize properly throughout the cells. In contrast, recombinant N244K protein did not associate with ROM-1, showed signs of protein aggregation, and colocalized with an ER marker. These experiments support the hypothesis that RDS mutations that interrupt higher-order oligomer formation but still interact with ROM-1 and fold properly in membranes may cause dominant, gain-of-function disease phenotypes while mutations that cause RDS misfolding (and thus incorrect trafficking and assembly) may be associated with a loss-of-function haploinsufficiency phenotype.

8664285|t|Mocarhagin, a novel cobra venom metalloproteinase, cleaves the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha. Identification of the sulfated tyrosine/anionic sequence Tyr-276-Glu-282 of glycoprotein Ibalpha as a binding site for von Willebrand factor and alpha-thrombin.
8664285|t|Platelet adhesion to the subendothelium is the initiating event in hemostasis and thrombosis and involves the binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) by the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex. The alpha-chain of GP Ib contains binding sites for both vWF and alpha-thrombin within a 45-kDa N-terminal tryptic fragment. In the present study, we have further delineated these sites using smaller proteolytic fragments and functional antibodies. Mocarhagin, a cobra venom metallaproteinase, generates the fragment His-1-Glu-282, while cathepsin G, a neutrophil granule serine protease, generates a slightly smaller fragment, His-1-Leu-275. His-1-Glu-282 was as effective as intact soluble GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) in inhibiting botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF to washed platelets (IC50 approximately 0.3 microM) whereas His-1-Leu-275 was an order of magnitude less effective (IC50 approximately 3 microM). Residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 (YDYYPEE) are part of an anionic region homologous to thrombin-binding molecules such as hirudin. In ligand blot analysis, thrombin blotted the His-1-Glu-282 fragment, but not His-1-Leu-275. The three tyrosine residues within Tyr-276-Glu-282 meet the consensus criteria for O-sulfation. A method was developed to distinguish O-sulfated from nonsulfated tyrosine residues based on differences in the UV absorbance spectra. Residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 were isolated from glycocalicin by proteolysis with mocarhagin and cathepsin G. Ion spray mass spectrometry confirmed that Tyr-278 and Tyr-279 was only approximately 50% O-sulfated. Four anti-GP Ibalpha monoclonal antibodies (SZ2, ES85, C34 and VM16d) were found to be modulator-specific, strongly inhibiting botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF, but having less or no effect on ristocetin-dependent vWF binding. These antibodies also inhibited the binding of thrombin to fixed platelets. Immunoprecipitation with GP ibalpha fragments defined the epitopes for these antibodies as SZ2 (Tyr-276-Glu-282), ES85 (Asp-283-Arg-293), C34 (His-1-Glu-282), and VM16d (His-1-Leu-275). An antibody which inhibited ristocetin-dependent, as well as botrocetin-dependent, vWF binding but had no effect on thrombin binding (Ak2) had an epitope within His-1-Leu-275. These findings indicate that the sulfated tyrosine/anionic GP Ibalpha residues Tyr-276-Glu-282 are important for the binding of thrombin and botrocetin-dependent binding of thrombin and the botrocetin-dependent binding of vWF, but that vWF also interacts with residues within His-1-Leu-275.

15133049|t|NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of SUMO ligase PIAS1 and its interaction with tumor suppressor p53 and A/T-rich DNA oligomers.
15133049|t|A member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family of proteins, PIAS1, have been reported to serve as an E3-type SUMO ligase for tumor suppressor p53 and its own. It also was proposed that the N-terminal domain of PIAS1 interacts with DNA as well as p53. Extensive biochemical studies have been devoted recently to understand sumoylations and its biological implications, whereas the structural aspects of the PIAS family and the mechanism of its interactions with various factors are less well known to date. In this study, the three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-65) of SUMO ligase PIAS1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed a unique four-helix bundle with a topology of an up-down-extended loop-down-up, a part of which the helix-extended loop-helix represented the SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) motif. Thus, this N-terminal domain may be referred to as a four-helix SAP domain. The glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay demonstrated that this domain possesses a binding ability to tumor suppressor p53, a target protein for sumoylation by PIAS1, whereas gel mobility assays showed that it has a strong affinity toward A/T-rich DNA. An NMR analysis of the four-helix SAP domain complexed with the 16-bp-long DNA demonstrated that one end of the four-helix bundle is the binding site and may fit into the minor groove of DNA. The three-dimensional structure and its binding duality are discussed in conjunction with the biological functions of PIAS1 as a SUMO ligase.

22902837|t|Differential stimulus-dependent synaptic recruitment of CaMKIIα by intracellular determinants of GluN2B.
22902837|t|The calcium-calmodulin activated kinase CaMKII mediates many forms of learning and memory. Activity-regulated translocation of CaMKII to synapses is important for its functions in synaptic plasticity. Here, we tested the role of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in recruiting CaMKIIα to synapses with different paradigms: global bath stimulation of NMDA receptors, a chemical long term potentiation (cLTP) protocol that selectively activates synaptic NMDA receptors, or local stimulation of NMDA receptors at a contiguous set of ~10-30 synapses that triggers a propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKII. Global or cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKIIα occurred in wild-type but not sister GluN2B -/- cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Expression of YFP-GluN2B, but not a similar level of YFP-GluN2A, rescued global and cLTP-induced CaMKIIα translocation. Using chimeric constructs, the pore-forming extracellular and membrane domains of GluN2A combined with the cytoplasmic tail of GluN2B were sufficient to rescue CaMKIIα translocation, whereas the reverse chimera was ineffective. Furthermore, the dual point mutation R1300Q,S1303D in GluN2B that blocks interaction of this high affinity site with CaMKII abolished rescue. Thus, CaMKII binding to GluN2B is required for global and cLTP-induced synaptic accumulation of CaMKIIα. However, surprisingly, locally induced propagating synaptic accumulation of CaMKIIα occurred normally in GluN2B -/- neurons, indistinguishably from wild-type. Thus, synaptic trapping of CaMKII during locally induced propagating translocation occurs by different mechanisms and molecular partners compared with global stimulation and cLTP paradigms. These findings underscore the complex regulatory properties and molecular interactions of CaMKIIα, a key player in synaptic plasticity.

10933782|t|Photolabeling identifies position 172 of the human AT(1) receptor as a ligand contact point: receptor-bound angiotensin II adopts an extended structure.
10933782|t|An angiotensin II (AngII) peptidic analogue in which the third residue (valine) was substituted with the photoreactive p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa) was used to identify ligand-binding sites of the human AT(1) receptor. High-affinity binding of the analogue, (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII, to the AT(1) receptor heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells enabled us to efficiently photolabel the receptor. Chemical and enzymatic digestions of the (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII-AT(1) complex were performed, and receptor fragments were analyzed in order to define the region of the receptor with which the ligand interacts. Results show that CNBr hydrolysis of the photolabeled receptor gave a glycosylated fragment which, after PNGase-F digestion, migrated as a 11.4 kDa fragment, circumscribing the labeled domain between residues 143-243 of the AT(1) receptor. Digestion of the receptor-ligand complex with Endo Lys-C or trypsin followed by PNGase-F treatment yielded fragments of 7 and 4 kDa, defining the labeling site of (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII within residues 168-199 of the AT(1) receptor. Photolabeling of three mutant receptors in which selected residues adjacent to residue 168 were replaced by methionine within the 168-199 fragment (I172M, T175M, and I177M) followed by CNBr cleavage revealed that the bound photoligand (125)I-[Bpa(3)]AngII forms a covalent bond with the side chain of Met(172) of the second extracellular loop of the AT(1) receptor. These data coupled with previously obtained results enable us to propose a model whereby AngII adopts an extended beta-strand conformation when bound to the receptor and would orient itself within the binding domain by having its N-terminal portion interacting with the second extracellular loop and its C-terminus interacting with residues of the seventh transmembrane domain.

10837138|t|Platelet-derived growth factor-mediated signaling through the Shb adaptor protein: effects on cytoskeletal organization.
10837138|t|The Src homology (SH) 2 domain adaptor protein Shb has previously been shown to interact with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta receptor. In this study we show an association between Shb and the PDGF-alpha receptor which is mediated by the SH2 domain of Shb and involves tyrosine residue 720 in the kinase insert domain of the receptor. To assess the role of Shb in PDGF-mediated signaling, we have overexpressed wild-type Shb or Shb carrying a mutation (R522K) which renders the SH2 domain inactive, in Patch mouse (PhB) fibroblasts expressing both PDGF receptors (PhB/Ralpha). Overexpression of wild-type Shb, but not the R522K Shb mutant, affected PDGF-mediated reorganization of the cytoskeleton by decreasing membrane ruffle formation and stimulating the generation of filopodia relative the parental control cells. In addition, the PDGF-induced receptor-associated phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt was similar in both PhB/Ralpha/Shb and PhB/Ralpha/ShbR522K cells compared with the parental control, whereas the activation of Rac in response to PDGF-BB was diminished only in the PhB/Ralpha/Shb cells. We conclude that Shb plays a role in PDGF-dependent regulation of certain cytoskeletal changes by modulating the ability of PDGF to activate Rac.

7535778|t|Demonstration of functionally different interactions between phospholipase C-gamma and the two types of platelet-derived growth factor receptors.
7535778|t|Phosphorylated tyrosine residues in receptor tyrosine kinases serve as binding sites for signal transduction molecules. We have identified two autophosphorylation sites, Tyr-988 and Tyr-1018, in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor carboxyl-terminal tail, which are involved in binding of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma). The capacities of the Y988F and Y1018F mutant PDGF alpha-receptors, expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells, to bind PLC-gamma are 60 and 5% of that of the wild-type receptor, respectively. Phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated peptides containing Tyr-1018 are able to compete with the intact receptor for binding to immobilized PLC-gamma SH2 domains; a phosphorylated Tyr-988 peptide competes 10 times less efficiently. The complex between PLC-gamma and the PDGF alpha-receptor is more stable than that of PLC-gamma and the PDGF beta-receptor. However, PDGF stimulation results in a smaller fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma and a smaller accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in cells expressing the alpha-receptor as compared with cells expressing the beta-receptor. We conclude that phosphorylated Tyr-988 and Tyr-1018 in the PDGF alpha-receptor carboxyl-terminal tail bind PLC-gamma, but this association leads to only a relatively low level of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-gamma.

15541764|t|Partial androgen insensitivity with phenotypic variation caused by androgen receptor mutations that disrupt activation function 2 and the NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction.
15541764|t|Partial androgen insensitivity with sex phenotype variation in two unrelated families was associated with missense mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene that disrupted the AR NH(2)-terminal/carboxy terminal interaction. Each mutation caused a single amino acid change within the region of the ligand-binding domain that forms activation function 2 (AF2). In one family, the mutation I737T was in alpha helix 4 and in the other F725L was between helices 3 and 4. Neither mutation altered androgen binding as determined by assays of mutant AR in the patient's cultured genital skin fibroblasts or of recombinant mutant receptors transfected into COS cells. In transient cotransfection assays in CV1 cells, transactivation with the AR mutants at low concentrations of DHT was reduced several fold compared with wild-type AR but increased at higher concentrations. Defects in NH(2)-terminal/carboxy terminal interactions were identified in mammalian two hybrid assays. In similar assays, there was reduced binding of the p160 coactivators TIF2/SRC2 and SRC1 to the mutant AR ligand binding domains (LBD). In the family with AR I737T, sex phenotype varied from severely defective masculinization in the proband to a maternal great uncle whose only manifestation of AIS was severe gynecomastia. He was fertile and passed the mutation to two daughters. The proband of the F725L family was also incompletely masculinized but was raised as a male while his half-sibling by a different father was affected more severely and reared as a female. These studies indicate that the function of an AR AF2 mutant in male development can vary greatly depending on the genetic background.

Here, using a recombinant MT1-MMP expressed in Escherichia coli we demonstrated that furin specifically cleaves MT1-MMP between Arg111-Tyr in vitro, which resulted in a stimulation of progelatinase A-activation function.

9465038|t|Membrane targeting of cGMP-dependent protein kinase is required for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel activation.
9465038|t|A recently cloned isoform of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), designated type II, was implicated as the mediator of cGMP-provoked intestinal Cl- secretion based on its localization in the apical membrane of enterocytes and on its capacity to activate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels. In contrast, the soluble type I cGK was unable to activate CFTR in intact cells, although both cGK I and cGK II could phosphorylate CFTR in vitro. To investigate the molecular basis for the cGK II isotype specificity of CFTR channel gating, we expressed cGK II or cGK I mutants possessing different membrane binding properties by using adenoviral vectors in a CFTR-transfected intestinal cell line, and we examined the ability of cGMP to phosphorylate and activate the Cl- channel. Mutation of the cGK II N-terminal myristoylation site (Gly2 --> Ala) reduced cGK II membrane binding and severely impaired cGK II activation of CFTR. Conversely, a chimeric protein, in which the N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain of cGK II was fused to the N terminus of cGK Ibeta, acquired the ability to associate with the membrane and activate the CFTR Cl- channel. The potency order of cGK constructs for activation of CFTR (cGK II > membrane-bound cGK I chimer > nonmyristoylated cGK II > cGK Ibeta) correlated with the extent of 32P incorporation into CFTR observed in parallel measurements. These results strongly support the concept that membrane targeting of cGK is a major determinant of CFTR Cl- channel activation in intact cells.

23758859|t|CK2-dependent phosphorylation of occludin regulates the interaction with ZO-proteins and tight junction integrity.
23758859|t|BACKGROUND: Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr kinase with multiple functions in the regulation of cell proliferation and transformation. In targeting adherens and tight junctions (TJs), CK2 modulates the strength and dynamics of epithelial cell-cell contacts. Occludin previously was identified as a substrate of CK2, however the functional consequences of CK2-dependent occludin phosphorylation on TJ function were unknown. RESULTS: Here, we present evidence that phosphorylation of a Thr400-XXX-Thr404-XXX-Ser408 motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of human occludin regulates assembly/disassembly and barrier properties of TJs. In contrast to wildtype and T400A/T404A/S408A-mutated occludin, a phospho-mimetic Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E construct was impaired in binding to ZO-2. Interestingly, pre-phosphorylation of a GST-Occ C-terminal domain fusion protein attenuated binding to ZO-2, whereas, binding to ZO-1 was not affected. Moreover, Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E showed delayed reassembly into TJs in Ca2+-switch experiments. Stable expression of Occ-T400E/T404E/S408E in MDCK C11 cells augments barrier properties in enhancing paracellular resistance in two-path impedance spectroscopy, whereas expression of wildtype and Occ-T400A/T404A/S408A did not affect transepithelial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role of CK2 in epithelial tight junction regulation. The occludin sequence motif at amino acids 400-408 apparently represents a hotspot for Ser/Thr-kinase phosphorylation and depending on the residue(s) which are phosphorylated it differentially modulates the functional properties of the TJ.

17008717|t|Molecular dynamics and in vitro analysis of Connexin43: A new 14-3-3 mode-1 interacting protein.
17008717|t|The interaction of cellular proteins with the gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43) is thought to form a dynamic scaffolding complex that functions as a platform for the assembly of signaling, structural, and cytoskeletal proteins. A high stringency Scansite search of rat Cx43 identified the motif containing Ser373 (S373) as a 14-3-3 binding site. The S373 motif and the second best mode-1 motif, containing Ser244 (S244), are conserved in rat, mouse, human, chicken, and bovine, but not in Xenopus or zebrafish Cx43. Docking studies of a mouse/rat 14-3-3 homology model with the modeled phosphorylated S373 or S244 peptide ligands or their serine-to-alanine mutants, S373A or S244A, revealed that the pS373 motif facilitated a greater number of intermolecular contacts than the pS244 motif, thus supporting a stronger 14-3-3 binding interaction with the pS373 motif. The alanine substitution also reduced more than half the number of intermolecular contacts between 14-3-3 and the S373 motif, emphasizing the phosphorylation dependence of this interaction. Furthermore, the ability of the wild-type or the S244A GST-Cx43 C-terminal fusion protein, but not the S373A fusion protein, to interact with either 14-3-3 or 14-3-3zeta in GST pull-down experiments clearly demonstrated that the S373 motif mediates the direct interaction between Cx43 and 14-3-3 proteins. Blocking growth factor-induced Akt activation and presumably any Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the S373 motif in ROSE 199 cells did not prevent the down-regulation of Cx43-mediated cell-cell communication, suggesting that an Akt-mediated interaction with 14-3-3 was not involved in the disruption of Cx43 function.

8672451|t|Members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family that phosphorylate the beta2-adrenergic receptor facilitate sequestration.
8672451|t|We recently reported that a beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) mutant, Y326A, defective in its ability to sequester in response to agonist stimulation was a poor substrate for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation; however, its ability to be phosphorylated and sequestered could be restored by overexpressing GRK2 [Ferguson et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24782]. In the present report, we tested the ability of each of the known GRKs (GRK1-6) to phosphorylate and rescue the sequestration of the Y326A mutant in HEK-293 cells. We demonstrate that in addition to GRK2, GRK3-6 can phosphorylate the Y326A mutant and rescue its sequestration; however, GRK1 was totally ineffective in rescuing either the phosphorylation or the sequestration of the mutant receptor. We found that the agonist-dependent rescue of Y326A mutant phosphorylation by GRK2, -3, and -5 was associated with the agonist-dependent rescue of sequestration. In contrast, overexpression of GRK4 and -6 led mainly to agonist-independent phosphorylation of the Y326A mutant accompanied by increased basal receptor sequestration. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation per se, but not the interaction with a specific GRK, is required to facilitate beta2AR sequestration.

22451851|t|Biochemical analysis of the interactions of IQGAP1 C-terminal domain with CDC42.
22451851|t|AIM: To understand the interaction of human IQGAP1 and CDC42, especially the effects of phosphorylation and a cancer-associated mutation. METHODS: Recombinant CDC42 and a novel C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1 were expressed in, and purified from, Escherichia coli. Site directed mutagenesis was used to create coding sequences for three phosphomimicking variants (S1441E, S1443D and S1441E/S1443D) and to recapitulate a cancer-associated mutation (M1231I). These variant proteins were also expressed and purified. Protein-protein crosslinking using 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide was used to investigate interactions between the C-terminal fragment and CDC42. These interactions were quantified using surface plasmon resonance measurements. Molecular modelling was employed to make predictions about changes to the structure and flexibility of the protein which occur in the cancer-associated variant. RESULTS: The novel, C-terminal region of human IQGAP1 (residues 877-1558) is soluble following expression and purification. It is also capable of binding to CDC42, as judged by crosslinking experiments. Interaction appears to be strongest in the presence of added GTP. The three phosphomimicking mutants had different affinities for CDC42. S1441E had an approximately 200-fold reduction in affinity compared to wild type. This was caused largely by a dramatic reduction in the association rate constant. In contrast, both S1443D and the double variant S1441E/S1443D had similar affinities to the wild type. The cancer-associated variant, M1231I, also had a similar affinity to wild type. However, in the case of this variant, both the association and dissociation rate constants were reduced approximately 10-fold. Molecular modelling of the M1231I variant, based on the published crystal structure of part of the C-terminal region, revealed no gross structural changes compared to wild type (root mean square deviation of 0.564 Å over 5556 equivalent atoms). However, predictions of the flexibility of the polypeptide backbone suggested that some regions of the variant protein had greatly increased rigidity compared to wild type. One such region is a loop linking the proposed CDC42 binding site with the helix containing the altered residue. It is suggested that this increase in rigidity is responsible for the observed changes in association and dissociation rate constants. CONCLUSION: The consequences of introducing negative charge at Ser-1441 or Ser-1443 in IQGAP1 are different. The cancer-associated variant M1231I exerts its effects partly by rigidifying the protein.

27799292|t|SUMO-Modified FADD Recruits Cytosolic Drp1 and Caspase-10 to Mitochondria for Regulated Necrosis.
27799292|t|Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) plays a key role in extrinsic apoptosis. Here, we show that FADD is SUMOylated as an essential step during intrinsic necrosis. FADD was modified at multiple lysine residues (K120/125/149) by small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2) during necrosis caused by calcium ionophore A23187 and by ischemic damage. SUMOylated FADD bound to dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in cells both in vitro and in ischemic tissue damage cores, thus promoting Drp1 recruitment by mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) to accomplish mitochondrial fragmentation. Mitochondrial-fragmentation-associated necrosis was blocked by FADD or Drp1 deficiency and SUMO-defective FADD expression. Interestingly, caspase-10, but not caspase-8, formed a ternary protein complex with SUMO-FADD/Drp1 on the mitochondria upon exposure to A23187 and potentiated Drp1 oligomerization for necrosis. Moreover, the caspase-10 L285F and A414V mutants, found in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively, regulated this necrosis. Our study reveals an essential role of SUMOylated FADD in Drp1- and caspase-10-dependent necrosis, providing insights into the mechanism of regulated necrosis by calcium overload and ischemic injury.

9858607|t|Rb inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFII250.
9858607|t|The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, Rb, interacts directly with the largest TATA-binding protein-associated factor, TAFII250, through multiple regions in each protein. To define the potential role(s) of this interaction, we examined whether Rb could regulate the intrinsic, bipartite kinase activity of TAFII250. Here, we report that Rb is able to inhibit the kinase activity of immunopurified and gel-purified recombinant TAFII250. Rb inhibits the autophosphorylation of TAFII250 as well as its phosphorylation of the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF in a dose-responsive manner. Inhibition of TAFII250 kinase activity involves the Rb pocket (amino acids 379 to 928) but not its amino terminus. In addition, Rb appears to specifically inhibit the amino-terminal kinase domain of TAFII250 through a direct protein-protein interaction. We further demonstrate that two different tumor-derived Rb pocket mutants, C706F and Deltaex22, are functionally defective for kinase inhibition, even though they are able to bind the amino terminus of TAFII250. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by Rb, involving direct interaction with TAFII250 and inhibition of its ability to phosphorylate itself, RAP74, and possibly other targets.

16831867|t|Yeast recombination factor Rdh54 functionally interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and catalyzes Rad51 removal from DNA.
16831867|t|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RDH54-encoded product, a member of the Swi2/Snf2 protein family, is needed for mitotic and meiotic interhomologue recombination and DNA repair. Previous biochemical studies employing Rdh54 purified from yeast cells have shown DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling by this protein, indicative of a DNA translocase function. Importantly, Rdh54 physically interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and promotes D-loop formation by the latter. Unfortunately, the low yield of Rdh54 from the yeast expression system has greatly hampered the progress on defining the functional interactions of this Swi2/Snf2-like factor with Rad51. Here we describe an E. coli expression system and purification scheme that together provide milligram quantities of nearly homogeneous Rdh54. Using this material, we demonstrate that Rdh54-mediated DNA supercoiling leads to transient DNA strand opening. Furthermore, at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, Rdh54 removes Rad51 from DNA. We furnish evidence that the Rad51 binding domain resides within the N terminus of Rdh54. Accordingly, N-terminal truncation mutants of Rdh54 that fail to bind Rad51 are also impaired for functional interactions with the latter. Interestingly, the rdh54 K352R mutation that ablates ATPase activity engenders a DNA repair defect even more severe than that seen in the rdh54Delta mutant. These results provide molecular information concerning the role of Rdh54 in homologous recombination and DNA repair, and they also demonstrate the functional significance of Rdh54.Rad51 complex formation. The Rdh54 expression and purification procedures described here should facilitate the functional dissection of this DNA recombination/repair factor.

11700320|t|Interaction between platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha and filamin-1 is essential for glycoprotein Ib/IX receptor anchorage at high shear.
11700320|t|The interaction of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor complex with the membrane skeleton of platelets is dependent on a specific interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of GPIbalpha and filamin-1. This interaction has been proposed to regulate key aspects of platelet function, including the ligand binding of GPIb-V-IX and the ability of the cells to sustain adhesion to von Willebrand factor (vWf) under high shear. In this study we have examined sequences in the GPIbalpha intracellular domain necessary for interaction of the receptor with filamin-1. We have identified two adjacent sequences involving amino acids 557-568 and 569-579 of the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic domain that are critical for normal association between the receptor complex and filamin-1. Under flow conditions, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing these two mutant receptors exhibited an increase in translocation velocity that was associated with increased cell detachment from the vWf matrix at high shear. The shear-dependent acceleration in velocity of mutant Delta557-568 and Delta569-579 CHO cells was associated with a critical defect in receptor anchorage, evident from significant extraction of GPIb-IX from the CHO cell membrane at high shear. These studies define a critical role for amino acids within the 557-579 sequence of GPIbalpha for interaction with filamin-1.

24980502|t|Retromer binding to FAM21 and the WASH complex is perturbed by the Parkinson disease-linked VPS35(D620N) mutation.
24980502|t|Retromer is a protein assembly that plays a central role in orchestrating export of transmembrane-spanning cargo proteins from endosomes into retrieval pathways destined for the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane [1]. Recently, a specific mutation in the retromer component VPS35, VPS35(D620N), has linked retromer dysfunction to familial autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson disease [2, 3]. However, the effect of this mutation on retromer function remains poorly characterized. Here we established that in cells expressing VPS35(D620N) there is a perturbation in endosome-to-TGN transport but not endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling, which we confirm in patient cells harboring the VPS35(D620N) mutation. Through comparative stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based analysis of wild-type VPS35 versus the VPS35(D620N) mutant interactomes, we establish that the major defect of the D620N mutation lies in the association to the actin-nucleating Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex. Moreover, using isothermal calorimetry, we establish that the primary defect of the VPS35(D620N) mutant is a 2.2 ± 0.5-fold decrease in affinity for the WASH complex component FAM21. These data define the primary molecular defect in retromer assembly that arises from the VPS35(D620N) mutation and, by revealing functional effects on retromer-mediated endosome-to-TGN transport, provide new insight into retromer deregulation in Parkinson disease.

21706042|t|Tyrosine sulfation in N-terminal domain of human C5a receptor is necessary for binding of chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus.
21706042|t|AIM: Staphylococcus aureus evades host defense through releasing several virulence proteins, such as chemotaxis inhibitory protein of staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS). It has been shown that extracellular N terminus of C5a receptor (C5aR) forms the binding domain for CHIPS, and tyrosine sulfation is emerging as a key factor in determining protein-protein interaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of tyrosine sulfation of N-terminal of C5aR in its binding with CHIPS. METHODS: Expression plasmids encoding C5aR and its mutants were prepared using PCR and site-directed mutagenesis and were used to transfect HEK 293T cells using calcium phosphate. Recombinant CHIPS protein was purified. Western blotting was used to examine the binding efficiency of CHIPS to C5aR or its mutants. RESULTS: CHIPS exclusively binds to C5aR, but not to C5L2 or C3aR. A nonspecific sulfation inhibitor, sodium chlorate (50 nmol/L), diminishes the binding ability of C5aR with CHIPS. Blocking sulfation by mutation of tyrosine to phenylalanine at positions 11 and 14 of C5aR N terminus, which blocked sulfation, completely abrogates CHIPS binding. When tyrosine 14 alone was mutated to phenylalanine, the binding efficiency of recombinant CHIPS was substantially decreased. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate a structural basis of C5aR-CHIPS association, in which tyrosine sulfation of N-terminal C5aR plays an important role. Our data may have potential significance in development of novel drugs for therapeutic intervention.

15469940|t|Aurora-A abrogation of p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity by phosphorylation of serine 215.
15469940|t|The tumor suppressor p53 is important in the decision to either arrest cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. p53 posttranslational modifications and association with other proteins have been implicated in the regulation of its stability and transactivation activity. Here we show that p53 is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Aurora-A at serine 215. Unlike most identified phosphorylation sites of p53 that positively associate with p53 function (Brooks, C. L., and Gu, W. (2003) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 15, 164-171), the phosphorylation of p53 by Aurora-A at Ser-215 abrogates p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity. Downstream target genes of p53, such as p21Cip/WAF1 and PTEN, were inhibited by Aurora-A in a Ser-215 phosphorylation-dependent manner (i.e. phosphomimic p53-S215D lost and non-phosphorylatable p53-S215A retained normal p53 function). As a result, Aurora-A overrides the apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by cisplatin and gamma-irradiation, respectively. However, the effect of Aurora-A on p53 DNA binding and transactivation activity was not affected by phosphorylation of Ser-315, a recently identified Aurora-A phosphorylation site of p53 (Katayama, H., Sasai, K., Kawai, H., Yuan, Z. M., Bondaruk, J., Suzuki, F., Fujii, S., Arlinghaus, R. B., Czerniak, B. A., and Sen, S. (2004) Nat. Genet. 36, 55-62). Our data indicate that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-215 by Aurora-A is a major mechanism to inactivate p53 and can provide a molecular insight for Aurora-A function.

12878163|t|Identification of Tyr900 in the kinase domain of c-Kit as a Src-dependent phosphorylation site mediating interaction with c-Crk.
12878163|t|We have previously demonstrated that ligand-stimulation of c-Kit induces phosphorylation of Tyr568 and Tyr570 in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor, leading to recruitment, phosphorylation and activation of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. In this paper, we demonstrate that members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases are able to phosphorylate c-Kit selectively on one particular tyrosine residue, Tyr900, located in the second part of the tyrosine kinase domain. In order to identify potential docking partners of Tyr900, a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence surrounding Tyr900 was used as an affinity matrix. By use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, CrkII was identified as a protein that specifically bound to Tyr900 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, possibly via the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Expression of a mutant receptor where Tyr900 had been replaced with a phenylalanine residue (Y900F) resulted in a receptor with reduced ability to phosphorylate CrkII. Together these data support a model where c-Src phosphorylates the receptor, thereby creating docking sites for SH2 domain containing proteins, leading to recruitment of Crk to the receptor.

16027149|t|Heterotrimeric G protein-independent signaling of a G protein-coupled receptor. Direct binding of ARNO/cytohesin-2 to the carboxyl terminus of the A2A adenosine receptor is necessary for sustained activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway.
16027149|t|The A2A adenosine receptor is a prototypical G(s)-coupled receptor, but it also signals, e.g. to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, via a pathway that is independent of heterotrimeric G proteins. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus affects the strength of the signal through these alternative pathways. In a yeast two-hybrid interaction hunt, we screened a human brain library for proteins that bound to the juxtamembrane portion of the carboxyl terminus of the A2A receptor. This approach identified ARNO/cytohesin-2, a nucleotide exchange factor for the small (monomeric) G proteins of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family, as a potential interaction partner. We confirmed a direct interaction by mutual pull down (of fusion proteins expressed in bacteria) and by immunoprecipitation of the proteins expressed in mammalian cells. To circumvent the long term toxicity associated with overexpression of ARNO/cytohesin-2, we created stable cell lines that stably expressed the A2A receptor and where ARNO/cytohesin-2 or the dominant negative version E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 was inducible by mifepristone. Cyclic AMP accumulation induced by an A2A-specific agonist was neither altered by ARNO/cytohesin-2 nor by the dominant negative version. This was also true for agonist-induced desensitization. In contrast, expression of dominant negative E156K-ARNO/cytohesin-2 and of dominant negative T27N-Arf6 abrogated the sustained phase of MAP kinase stimulation induced by the A2A receptor. We therefore conclude that ARNO/cytohesin-2 is required to support the alternative, heterotrimeric G protein-independent, signaling pathway of A2A receptor, which is stimulation of MAP kinase.

24383527|t|Role of the β1 integrin molecule in T-cell activation and migration.
24383527|t|Abstract β1 integrins play crucial roles in a variety of cell processes such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of lymphocytes. To understand the molecular mechanisms of these various biological effects, it is particularly important to analyze cell signaling through the β1 integrins. Our previous study showed that PLC-γ, pp125FAK (focal adhesion kinase), pp105, paxillin, p59fyn, p56lck, and ERK1/2 are phosphorylated in their tyrosine residues upon engagement of β1 integrins. We identified pp105 as Cas (Crk-associated substrate)-related protein and successfully cloned its cDNA. pp105 is a Cas homologue predominantly expressed in the cells of lymphoid lineage, which led us to designate it Cas-L. Like p130Cas, Cas-L contains a single SH3 domain and multiple SH2-binding sites (YXXP motif), which are suggested to bind SH2 domains of Crk, Nck, and SHPTP2. Subsequent studies revealed that pp125FAK binds Cas-L on its SH3 domain and phosphorylates its tyrosine residues upon β1 integrin stimulation. Since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L plays an important role in lymphocyte-specific signals. We have shown that Cas-L is involved in the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 signaling pathway as well as the β1 integrin signaling pathway. Cas-L is transiently phosphorylated following CD3 crosslinking and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk and C3G. Furthermore, a Cas-L mutant (Cas-LΔSH3), which lacks the binding site for FAK, is still tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 crosslinking but not upon β1 integrin crosslinking, suggesting that FAK is not involved in CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation. Finally, we have identified a crucial role of Cas-L in β1 integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. We have found that this co-stimulatory pathway is impaired in the Jurkat T-cell line, and that the expression level of Cas-L is reduced in the Jurkat cells compared to peripheral T-cells. The transfection of Cas-L cDNA into Jurkat cells restored the β1 integrin-mediated co-stimulation, while the transfection of Cas-LΔSH3 mutant failed to do so, which contrasts with the case of CD3-mediated signaling. These results indicate that Cas-L plays a key role, through the association and phosphorylation by FAK, in β1 integrin-mediated T-cell co-stimulation. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L is critical for T-cell receptor and β1 integrin-induced T-lymphocyte migration. Taken together, Cas-L might be the bi-modal docking protein which assembles the signals through β1 integrins and TCR/CD3, and which participates in a variety of T-cell functions.

16331994|t|Regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 by heat shock protein 90-dependent stabilization and CHIP-dependent proteasomal degradation.
16331994|t|Alcohol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) has the most rapid turnover of any member of this large family of membrane-bound oxygenases, and its degradation rate is altered profoundly by various substrates, such as ethanol and CCl(4). CYP2E1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and because the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery is often involved in maintaining the balance between protein integrity and degradation by this pathway, we have asked whether CYP2E1 is regulated by the chaperone machinery. We show here that treatment of transformed human skin fibroblasts stably expressing CYP2E1 with the hsp90 inhibitor radicicol results in CYP2E1 degradation that is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Immunoadsorption of hsp90 from cytosol of HEK cells expressing the truncated CYP2E1(Delta3-29) yields coadsorption of CYP2E1(Delta3-29). Cotransfection of HEK cells with both the truncated CYP2E1 and the hsp70-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP results in CYP2E1(Delta3-29) degradation, and CYP2E1(Delta3-29) co-immunoadsorbs with myc-CHIP from cytosol of cotransfected cells. Purified, bacterially expressed CYP2E1(Delta3-29) is ubiquitylated in a CHIP-dependent manner when it is incubated with a purified system containing the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, E2, and CHIP. CYP2E1 is the first P450 shown to be an hsp90 "client" protein that can be ubiquitylated by the hsp70-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Our observations lead to a general model of how substrates, such as ethanol, can regulate the interaction of CYP2E1 with the chaperones hsp90 and hsp70 to profoundly alter enzyme turnover.

14752512|t|Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) to sequester their translocation during staurosporine-induced apoptosis.
14752512|t|AlphaA- and alphaB-crystallins are distinct antiapoptotic regulators. Regarding the antiapoptotic mechanisms, we have recently demonstrated that alphaB-crystallin interacts with the procaspase-3 and partially processed procaspase-3 to repress caspase-3 activation. Here, we demonstrate that human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins prevent staurosporine-induced apoptosis through interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family. Using GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitations, we demonstrated that alpha-crystallins bind to Bax and Bcl-X(S) both in vitro and in vivo. Human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallins display similar affinity to both proapoptotic regulators, and so are true with their antiapoptotic ability tested in human lens epithelial cells, human retina pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and rat embryonic myocardium cells (H9c2) under treatment of staurosporine, etoposide or sorbitol. Two prominent mutants, R116C in alphaA-crystallin and R120G, in alphaB-crystallin display much weaker affinity to Bax and Bcl-X(S). Through the interaction, alpha-crystallins prevent the translocation of Bax and Bcl-X(S) from cytosol into mitochondria during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. As a result, alpha-crystallins preserve the integrity of mitochondria, restrict release of cytochrome c, repress activation of caspase-3 and block degradation of PARP. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel antiapoptotic mechanism for alpha-crystallins.

8816443|t|The p160 RhoA-binding kinase ROK alpha is a member of a kinase family and is involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton.
8816443|t|The GTPase RhoA has been implicated in various cellular activities, including the formation of stress fibers, motility, and cytokinesis. We recently reported on a p150 serine/threonine kinase (termed ROK alpha) binding RhoA only in its active GTP-bound state and on its cDNA; introduction of RhoA into HeLa cells resulted in translocation of the cytoplasmic kinase to plasma membranes, consistent with ROK alpha being a target for RhoA (T. Leung, E. Manser, L. Tan, and L. Lim, J. Biol. Chem. 256:29051-29054, 1995). Reanalysis of the cDNA revealed that ROK alpha contains an additional N-terminal region. We also isolated another cDNA which encoded a protein (ROK beta) with 90% identity to ROK alpha in the kinase domain. Both ROK alpha and ROK beta, which had a molecular mass of 160 kDa, contained a highly conserved cysteine/histidine-rich domain located within a putative pleckstrin homology domain. The kinases bound RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC but not Rac1 and Cdc42. The Rho-binding domain comprises about 30 amino acids. Mutations within this domain caused partial or complete loss of Rho binding. The morphological effects of ROK alpha were investigated by microinjecting HeLa cells with DNA constructs encoding various forms of ROK alpha. Full-length ROK alpha promoted formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, consistent with its being an effector of RhoA. ROK alpha truncated at the C terminus promoted this formation and also extensive condensation of actin microfilaments and nuclear disruption. The proteins exhibited protein kinase activity which was required for stress fiber formation; the kinase-dead ROK alpha K112A and N-terminally truncated mutants showed no such promotion. The latter mutant instead induced disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, accompanied by cell spreading. These effects were mediated by the C-terminal region containing Rho-binding, cysteine/histidine-rich, and pleckstrin homology domains. Thus, the multidomained ROK alpha appears to be involved in reorganization of the cytoskeleton, with the N and C termini acting as positive and negative regulators, respectively, of the kinase domain whose activity is crucial for formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes.

20808790|t|Cyclin B1/Cdk1 phosphorylation of mitochondrial p53 induces anti-apoptotic response.
20808790|t|The pro-apoptotic function of p53 has been well defined in preventing genomic instability and cell transformation. However, the intriguing fact that p53 contributes to a pro-survival advantage of tumor cells under DNA damage conditions raises a critical question in radiation therapy for the 50% human cancers with intact p53 function. Herein, we reveal an anti-apoptotic role of mitochondrial p53 regulated by the cell cycle complex cyclin B1/Cdk1 in irradiated human colon cancer HCT116 cells with p53(+/+) status. Steady-state levels of p53 and cyclin B1/Cdk1 were identified in the mitochondria of many human and mouse cells, and their mitochondrial influx was significantly enhanced by radiation. The mitochondrial kinase activity of cyclin B1/Cdk1 was found to specifically phosphorylate p53 at Ser-315 residue, leading to enhanced mitochondrial ATP production and reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. The improved mitochondrial function can be blocked by transfection of mutant p53 Ser-315-Ala, or by siRNA knockdown of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 genes. Enforced translocation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 into mitochondria with a mitochondrial-targeting-peptide increased levels of Ser-315 phosphorylation on mitochondrial p53, improved ATP production and decreased apoptosis by sequestering p53 from binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, reconstitution of wild-type p53 in p53-deficient HCT116 p53(-/-) cells resulted in an increased mitochondrial ATP production and suppression of apoptosis. Such phenomena were absent in the p53-deficient HCT116 p53(-/-) cells reconstituted with the mutant p53. These results demonstrate a unique anti-apoptotic function of mitochondrial p53 regulated by cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated Ser-315 phosphorylation in p53-wild-type tumor cells, which may provide insights for improving the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy, especially for tumors that retain p53.

The N terminus of the protein contains a PDZ and a proline-rich domain, two motifs known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. By using the yeast two-hybrid approach, we screened for proteins that interact with the N terminus of rPDZRhoGEF. The light chain 2 of microtubule-associated protein 1 (LC2) was the only protein identified from the screen that does not contain a type I PDZ-binding motif at its extreme C terminus (-(S/T)Xphi-COOH, where phi is a hydrophobic amino acid). However, the C terminus does conform to a type II-binding motif (-phiXphi). We report here that rPDZRhoGEF interacts with LC2 via the PDZ domain, and the interaction is abolished by mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed using GST fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitations. Expression of rPDZRhoGEF mutants that are unable to interact with proteins via the carboxylate-binding loop induced changes in cell morphology and actin organization. These mutants alter the activation of RhoGTPases, and coexpression of dominant-negative RhoGTPases prevent the morphological changes. Furthermore, in cells expressing wild type rPDZRhoGEF, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization produces changes in cell morphology that are similar to those induced by rPDZRhoGEF mutants. These results indicate that modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of rPDZRhoGEF through interaction with microtubule-associated protein light chains may coordinate microtubule integrity and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. This coordinated action of the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons is essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal polarity.

27407148|t|DNA damage tolerance pathway involving DNA polymerase ι and the tumor suppressor p53 regulates DNA replication fork progression.
27407148|t|DNA damage tolerance facilitates the progression of replication forks that have encountered obstacles on the template strands. It involves either translesion DNA synthesis initiated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoubiquitination or less well-characterized fork reversal and template switch mechanisms. Herein, we characterize a novel tolerance pathway requiring the tumor suppressor p53, the translesion polymerase ι (POLι), the ubiquitin ligase Rad5-related helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), and the SWI/SNF catalytic subunit (SNF2) translocase zinc finger ran-binding domain containing 3 (ZRANB3). This novel p53 activity is lost in the exonuclease-deficient but transcriptionally active p53(H115N) mutant. Wild-type p53, but not p53(H115N), associates with POLι in vivo. Strikingly, the concerted action of p53 and POLι decelerates nascent DNA elongation and promotes HLTF/ZRANB3-dependent recombination during unperturbed DNA replication. Particularly after cross-linker-induced replication stress, p53 and POLι also act together to promote meiotic recombination enzyme 11 (MRE11)-dependent accumulation of (phospho-)replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA. These results implicate a direct role of p53 in the processing of replication forks encountering obstacles on the template strand. Our findings define an unprecedented function of p53 and POLι in the DNA damage response to endogenous or exogenous replication stress.

7731720|t|B-Raf protein isoforms interact with and phosphorylate Mek-1 on serine residues 218 and 222.
7731720|t|The B-raf/c-Rmil proto-oncogene belongs to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases. It encodes multiple protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of two exons located upstream of the kinase domain. Recent studies suggested that B-Raf could be the intermediate molecule between Ras and Mek-1 (MAP Kinase Kinase) in signalling pathways specific of neural cells. However, there has been no evidence for a direct interaction between B-Raf and Mek-1. We report here that different B-Raf isoforms can be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Mek-1 antisera in COS-1 cells and that the kinase activity of B-Raf is not required for its interaction with Mek-1. We also show that all B-Raf isoforms tested phosphorylate Mek-1 in a time-dependent manner, whereas kinase defective mutants fail to do so. Finally, we demonstrate that the constitutively activated S218D, S222D and S218D/S222D mutants of Mek-1 interact similarly with B-Raf. However, only the S218D and S222D mutants, and not the S218D/S222D double mutant, can be phosphorylated by B-Raf isoforms. Therefore, serine residues 218 and 222, previously shown to regulate Mek-1 activity, appear to be the major phosphorylation sites by B-Raf in vitro.

7622467|t|A conserved NPLFY sequence contributes to agonist binding and signal transduction but is not an internalization signal for the type 1 angiotensin II receptor.
7622467|t|A conserved NPX2-3Y sequence that is located in the seventh transmembrane helix of many G protein-coupled receptors has been predicted to participate in receptor signaling and endocytosis. The role of this sequence (NPLFY) in angiotensin II receptor function was studied in mutant and wild-type rat type 1a angiotensin II receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The ability of the receptor to interact with G proteins and to stimulate inositol phosphate responses was markedly impaired by alanine replacement of Asn298 and was reduced by replacement of Pro299 or Tyr302. The F301A mutant receptor exhibited normal G protein coupling and inositol phosphate responses, and the binding of the peptide antagonist, [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II, was only slightly affected. However, its affinity for angiotensin II and the nonpeptide antagonist losartan was reduced by an order of a magnitude, suggesting that angiotensin II and losartan share an intramembrane binding site, possibly through their aromatic moieties. None of the agonist-occupied mutant receptors, including Y302A and triple alanine replacements of Phe301, Tyr302, and Phe304, showed substantial changes in their internalization kinetics. These findings demonstrate that the NPLFY sequence of the type 1a angiotensin II receptor is not an important determinant of agonist-induced internalization. However, the Phe301 residue contributes significantly to agonist binding, and Asn298 is required for normal receptor activation and signal transduction.

21978935|t|Cooperative phosphorylation of FADD by Aur-A and Plk1 in response to taxol triggers both apoptotic and necrotic cell death.
21978935|t|Administration of the antimitotic chemotherapeutic taxol is known to cause accumulation of the mitotic kinase Aurora-A (Aur-A). Here, we report that Aur-A phosphorylates S203 of the Fas associated with death domain protein (FADD) in response to taxol treatment. In addition, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) failed to phosphorylate the Aur-A-unphosphorylatable FADD substitution mutant S203A, indicating that phosphorylation of S203 by Aur-A serves to prime FADD for Plk1-mediated phosphorylation at S194. The double-phosphorylation-mimicking mutant form of FADD, FADD-S194D/S203D (FADD-DD), recruited caspase-8, activating the caspase-dependent cell death pathway. FADD-DD also dissociated the cell death protein RIP1 from FADD, resulting in activation of RIP1 and triggering of caspase-independent cell death. Consistent with its death-promoting potential, FADD-DD showed robust tumor suppressor activity. However, single-phosphorylation-mimicking mutant forms of FADD, FADD-S194D/S203A (FADD-DA) and FADD-S194A/S203D (FADD-AD), were incapable of carrying out such functions, indicating that double phosphorylation of FADD is critical for the execution of cell death and tumor suppression. Collectively, our data show the existence of cooperative actions between Aur-A and Plk1 mitotic kinases in response to taxol, providing a molecular explanation for the action mechanism of taxol.

9162084|t|Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 is phosphorylatable by c-Src, binds Src-Src homology 2 domain, and exhibits immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like properties.
9162084|t|Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is 130-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily that localizes to cell-cell borders of confluent endothelial cells and has been shown to play a role in the control of endothelial sheet migration and leukocyte transmigration through the endothelium. The cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in the modulation of PECAM-1 function. Mutation of tyrosine 663 or 686 in the cytoplasmic tail reduces phosphorylation and mutation of 686 is associated with a reduction in PECAM-1-mediated inhibition of cell migration (1). We have previously noted that these two tyrosine residues are surrounded by consensus sequences for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain binding (1, 2), and the experiments presented explore the potential for PECAM-1-Src and PECAM-1-SH2 domain interactions. PECAM-1 is more highly phosphorylated in endothelial cells overexpressing c-Src, and in in vitro kinase assays, c-Src can phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PECAM cytoplasmic tail fusion protein. The phosphorylated fusion protein associates with the bead-bound c-Src. This association appears to be mediated by Src-SH2 domain, because PECAM-1 can be precipitated by a GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix. The binding to the GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix correlates directly with the level of PECAM-1 phosphorylation, because more PECAM-1 is precipitated from c-Src overexpressors and from wild-type rather than Tyr663 --> Phe and Tyr686 --> Phe mutant PECAM-1 expressors. Yet unidentified phosphoproteins can also be coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type but not mutant PECAM-1. Finally, we note the similarity of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain sequence to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. Our data begin to delineate how tyrosines 663 and 686 may play a role in mediating PECAM-1 signal transduction.

16856878|t|CHMP7, a novel ESCRT-III-related protein, associates with CHMP4b and functions in the endosomal sorting pathway.
16856878|t|All CHMPs (charged multivesicular body proteins) reported to date have common features: they all contain approx. 200 amino acid residues, have coiled-coil regions and have a biased distribution of charged residues (basic N-terminal and acidic C-terminal halves). Yeast orthologues of CHMPs, including an ESCRT-III component Snf7, are required for the sorting of cargo proteins to intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. We have characterized a novel human ESCRT-III-related protein, designated CHMP7, which consists of 453 amino acid residues. CHMP7 contains an SNF7 domain and a distantly SNF7-related domain in its C-terminal half and N-terminal half respectively. Among the ten CHMP proteins classified previously in six subfamilies (CHMP1-CHMP6), the C-terminal SNF7 domain of CHMP7 is most similar to the SNF7 domain of CHMP6, which associates with CHMP4 proteins and EAP20, a component of ESCRT-II. Pull-down assays using lysates of HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney) cells that overexpressed Strep-tagged CHMP7 and GFP (green fluorescent protein)-fused CHMP4b (also named Shax1) revealed a positive interaction between the C-terminal half of CHMP7 and CHMP4b. However, interaction was not observed between CHMP7 and EAP20. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that FLAG-CHMP7 is distributed in HeLa cells diffusely throughout the cytoplasm, but with some accumulation, especially in the perinuclear area. The distribution of FLAG-CHMP7 was altered to a cytoplasmic punctate pattern by overexpression of either CHMP4b-GFP or GFP-Vps4B(E235Q), a dominant-negative mutant of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) Vps4B, and partially co-localized with them. Ubiquitinated proteins and endocytosed EGF accumulated in GFP-CHMP7-expressing cells. A dominant-negative effect of overexpressed GFP-CHMP7 was also observed in the release of virus-like particles from HEK-293T cells that transiently expressed the MLV (murine leukaemia virus) Gag protein. These results suggest that CHMP7, a novel CHMP4-associated ESCRT-III-related protein, functions in the endosomal sorting pathway.

27648839|t|HIV-1 Vpr Abrogates the Effect of TSG101 Overexpression to Support Virus Release.
27648839|t|HIV-1 budding requires interaction between Gag and cellular TSG101 to initiate viral particle assembly and release via the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. However, some reports show that overexpression of TSG101 inhibits virus release by disruption of Gag targeting process. Since a HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpr binds to Gag p6 domain at the position close to the binding site for TSG101, whether Vpr implicates TSG101 overexpression effect has not been investigated. Here, we found that Vpr abrogates TSG101 overexpression effect to rescue viral production. Co-transfection of TSG101 and Gag with Vpr prevented TSG101-induced Gag accumulation in endosomes and lysosomes. In addition, Vpr rescued virus-like particle (VLP) production in a similar manner as a lysosomal inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1 indicating that Vpr inhibits TSG101-induced Gag downregulation via lysosomal pathway. Vpr and Gag interaction is required to counteract TSG101 overexpression effect since Vpr A30F mutant which is unable to interact with Gag and incorporate into virions, reduced ability to prevent Gag accumulation and to rescue VLP production. In addition, GST pull-down assays and Biacore analysis revealed that Vpr competed with TSG101 for Gag binding. These results indicate that Vpr overcomes the effects of TSG101 overexpression to support viral production by competing with TSG101 to bind Gag.

12783850|t|The p38 subunit of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex is a Parkin substrate: linking protein biosynthesis and neurodegeneration.
12783850|t|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurological disorder, characterized by the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs). The discovery of genes responsible for familial forms of the disease has provided insights into its pathogenesis. Mutations in the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of specific protein substrates, have been found in nearly 50% of patients with autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism. The abnormal accumulation of substrates due to loss of Parkin function may be the cause of neurodegeneration in parkin-related parkinsonism. Here, we demonstrate that Parkin interacts with, ubiquitylates and promotes the degradation of p38, a key structural component of the mammalian aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex. We found that the ubiquitylation of p38 is abrogated by truncated variants of Parkin lacking essential functional domains, but not by the pathogenic Lys161Asn point mutant. Expression of p38 in COS7 cells resulted in the formation of aggresome-like inclusions in which Parkin was systematically sequestered. In the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cell line, Parkin promoted the formation of ubiquitylated p38-positive inclusions. Moreover, the overexpression of p38 in SH-SY5Y cells caused significant cell death against which Parkin provided protection. Analysis of p38 expression in the human adult midbrain revealed strong immunoreactivity in normal dopaminergic neurons and the labeling of LBs in idiopathic PD. This suggests that p38 plays a role in the pathogenesis of PD, opening the way for a detailed examination of its potential non-canonical role in neurodegeneration.

23612964|t|Acquired substrate preference for GAB1 protein bestows transforming activity to ERBB2 kinase lung cancer mutants.
23612964|t|Activating mutations in the αC-β4 loop of the ERBB2 kinase domain, such as ERBB2(YVMA) and ERBB2(G776VC), have been identified in human lung cancers and found to drive tumor formation. Here we observe that the docking protein GAB1 is hyper-phosphorylated in carcinomas from transgenic mice and in cell lines expressing these ERBB2 cancer mutants. Using dominant negative GAB1 mutants lacking canonical tyrosine residues for SHP2 and PI3K interactions or lentiviral shRNA that targets GAB1, we demonstrate that GAB1 phosphorylation is required for ERBB2 mutant-induced cell signaling, cell transformation, and tumorigenesis. An enzyme kinetic analysis comparing ERBB2(YVMA) to wild type using physiologically relevant peptide substrates reveals that ERBB2(YVMA) kinase adopts a striking preference for GAB1 phosphorylation sites as evidenced by ∼150-fold increases in the specificity constants (kcat/Km) for several GAB1 peptides, and this change in substrate selectivity was predominantly attributed to the peptide binding affinities as reflected by the apparent Km values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERBB2(YVMA) phosphorylates GAB1 protein ∼70-fold faster than wild type ERBB2 in vitro. Notably, the mutation does not significantly alter the Km for ATP or sensitivity to lapatinib, suggesting that, unlike EGFR lung cancer mutants, the ATP binding cleft of the kinase is not significantly changed. Taken together, our results indicate that the acquired substrate preference for GAB1 is critical for the ERBB2 mutant-induced oncogenesis.

27325299|t|Ligand stimulation of CD95 induces activation of Plk3 followed by phosphorylation of caspase-8.
27325299|t|Upon interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand, sequential association of the adaptor molecule FADD (MORT1), pro-forms of caspases-8/10, and the caspase-8/10 regulator c-FLIP leads to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex. Here, we identify polo-like kinase (Plk) 3 as a new interaction partner of the death receptor CD95. The enzymatic activity of Plk3 increases following interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand. Knockout (KO) or knockdown of caspase-8, CD95 or FADD prevents activation of Plk3 upon CD95 stimulation, suggesting a requirement of a functional DISC for Plk3 activation. Furthermore, we identify caspase-8 as a new substrate for Plk3. Phosphorylation occurs on T273 and results in stimulation of caspase-8 proapoptotic function. Stimulation of CD95 in cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable caspase-8-T273A mutant in a rescue experiment or in Plk3-KO cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the processing of caspase-8 prominently. Low T273 phosphorylation correlates significantly with low Plk3 expression in a cohort of 95 anal tumor patients. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of kinase activation within the Plk family and propose a new model for the stimulation of the extrinsic death pathway in tumors with high Plk3 expression.

24450359|t|Adaptor protein2 (AP2) orchestrates CXCR2-mediated cell migration.
24450359|t|The chemokine receptor CXCR2 is vital for inflammation, wound healing, angiogenesis, cancer progression and metastasis. Adaptor protein 2 (AP2), a clathrin binding heterotetrameric protein comprised of α, β2, μ2 and σ2 subunits, facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mutation of the LLKIL motif in the CXCR2 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) results in loss of AP2 binding to the receptor and loss of ligand-mediated receptor internalization and chemotaxis. AP2 knockdown also results in diminished ligand-mediated CXCR2 internalization, polarization and chemotaxis. Using knockdown/rescue approaches with AP2-μ2 mutants, the binding domains were characterized in reference to CXCR2 internalization and chemotaxis. When in an open conformation, μ2 Patch 1 and Patch 2 domains bind tightly to membrane PIP2 phospholipids. When AP2-μ2, is replaced with μ2 mutated in Patch 1 and/or Patch 2 domains, ligand-mediated receptor binding and internalization are not lost. However, chemotaxis requires AP2-μ2 Patch 1, but not Patch 2. AP2-σ2 has been demonstrated to bind dileucine motifs to facilitate internalization. Expression of AP2-σ2 V88D and V98S dominant negative mutants resulted in loss of CXCR2 mediated chemotaxis. Thus, AP2 binding to both membrane phosphatidylinositol phospholipids and dileucine motifs is crucial for directional migration or chemotaxis. Moreover, AP2-mediated receptor internalization can be dissociated from AP2-mediated chemotaxis.

16723738|t|Endocytosis of the glucose transporter GLUT8 is mediated by interaction of a dileucine motif with the beta2-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 adaptor complex.
16723738|t|The glucose transporter GLUT8 cycles between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane. Like the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4, GLUT8 is primarily located in intracellular compartments under basal conditions. Whereas translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is stimulated by insulin, the distribution of GLUT8 is not affected by insulin treatment in adipose cells. However, blocking endocytosis by co-expression of a dominant-negative dynamin GTPase (K44A) or mutation of the N-terminal dileucine (LL(12/13)) motif in GLUT8 leads to accumulation of the glucose transporter at the cell surface in a variety of different cell types. Yeast two-hybrid analyses and GST pulldown assays reveal that the LL signal constitutes a binding site for the beta2-adaptin subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex, implicating this motif in targeting of GLUT8 to clathrin-coated vesicles. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays provide evidence that the binding site for the LL motif maps to the appendage domain of beta2-adaptin. To analyze the biological significance of the LL/beta2 interaction, we utilized RNA interference to specifically knockdown AP-2. Our results show that RNAi-mediated targeting of the mu2 subunit leads to cellular depletion of AP-2, but not AP-1 adaptor complexes in HeLa cells. As a consequence, GLUT8 accumulates at the plasma membrane at comparable levels to those observed in K44A-transfected cells. Conversely, the intracellular localization of mutant GLUT8-LL/AA is restored by replacing the LL motif in GLUT8 with the transferrin receptor-derived mu2-adaptin binding motif YTRF, indicating that for endocytosis both AP-2 binding motifs can substitute for each other. Thus, our data demonstrate that recruitment of GLUT8 to the endocytic machinery occurs via direct interaction of the dileucine motif with beta2-adaptin, and that endocytosis might be the main site at which GLUT8 is likely to be regulated.

17595163|t|Site-directed mutagenesis in the B-neuropilin-2 domain selectively enhances its affinity to VEGF165, but not to semaphorin 3F.
17595163|t|Neuropilins (NRPs) are 130-kDa receptors that bind and respond to the class 3 semaphorin family of axon guidance molecules (SEMAs) and to members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of angiogenic factors. Two NRPs have been reported so far, NRP1 and NRP2. Unlike NRP1, little is known about NRP2 interactions with its ligands, VEGF165 and SEMA3F. Cell binding studies reveal that VEGF165 and SEMA3F bind NRP2 with similar affinities, 5.2 and 3.9 nM, respectively, and are competitive NRP2 ligands. Immunoprecipitation studies show that the B (b1b2) extracellular domain of NRP2 is sufficient for VEGF165 binding, whereas SEMA3F requires both the A (a1a2) and B domains. To identify residues of B-NRP2 involved in VEGF165 binding, point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. VEGF165 is a basic protein. Reduction of the electronegative potential of B-NRP2 by exchanging acidic residues for uncharged alanine (B-NRP2 E284A,E291A) in the 280-290 b1-NRP2 loop resulted in a 2-fold reduction in VEGF165 affinity. Conversely, enhancing the electronegative potential (B-NRP2 R287E,N290D and R287E,N290S) significantly increased VEGF165 affinity for B-NRP2 by 8- and 6.6-fold, respectively. The mutagenesis did not affect SEMA3F/B-NRP2 interactions. These results demonstrate that it is possible to alter VEGF165 affinity for NRP2 without affecting SEMA3F affinity. They also identify NRP2 residues involved in VEGF165 binding and suggest that modifications of B-NRP2 could lead to potentially high affinity selective inhibitors of VEGF165/NRP2 interactions.

12782621|t|Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type 1gamma and beta1-integrin cytoplasmic domain bind to the same region in the talin FERM domain.
12782621|t|Talin is an essential component of focal adhesions that couples beta-integrin cytodomains to F-actin and provides a scaffold for signaling proteins. Recently, the integrin beta3 cytodomain and phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) kinase type 1gamma (a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-synthesizing enzyme) were shown to bind to the talin FERM domain (subdomain F3). We have characterized the PIP kinase-binding site by NMR using a 15N-labeled talin F2F3 polypeptide. A PIP kinase peptide containing the minimal talin-binding site formed a 1:1 complex with F2F3, causing a substantial number of chemical shift changes. In particular, two of the three Arg residues (Arg339 and Arg358), four of eight Ile residues, and one of seven Val residues in F3 were affected. Although a R339A mutation did not affect the exchange kinetics, R358A or R358K mutations markedly weakened binding. The Kd for the interaction determined by Trp fluorescence was 6 microm, and the R358A mutation increased the Kd to 35 microm. Comparison of these results with those of the crystal structure of a beta3-integrin cytodomain talin F2F3 chimera shows that both PIP kinase and integrins bind to the same surface of the talin F3 subdomain. Indeed, binding of talin present in rat brain extracts to a glutathione S-transferase integrin beta1-cytodomain polypeptide was inhibited by the PIP kinase peptide. The results suggest that ternary complex formation with a single talin FERM domain is unlikely, although both integrins and PIP kinase may bind simultaneously to the talin anti-parallel dimer.

METHODS: Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene sequencing was performed in 14 patients with Hz/Hc, and their clinical phenotype was compared with that of 11 patients with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. PSTPIP1-pyrin interactions were analyzed by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. A structural model of the PSTPIP1 dimer was generated. Cytokine profiles were analyzed by using the multiplex immunoassay, and MRP8/14 serum concentrations were analyzed by using an ELISA. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were heterozygous for a missense mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene, resulting in a p.E250K mutation, and 1 carried a mutation resulting in p.E257K. Both mutations substantially alter the electrostatic potential of the PSTPIP1 dimer model in a region critical for protein-protein interaction. Patients with Hz/Hc have extremely high MRP8/14 concentrations (2045 ± 1300 μg/mL) compared with those with PAPA syndrome (116 ± 74 μg/mL) and have a distinct clinical phenotype. A specific cytokine profile is associated with Hz/Hc. Hz/Hc mutations altered protein binding of PSTPIP1, increasing interaction with pyrin through phosphorylation of PSTPIP1. CONCLUSION: Mutations resulting in charge reversal in the y-domain of PSTPIP1 (E→K) and increased interaction with pyrin cause a distinct autoinflammatory disorder defined by clinical and biochemical features not found in patients with PAPA syndrome, indicating a unique genotype-phenotype correlation for mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. This is the first inborn autoinflammatory syndrome in which inflammation is driven by uncontrolled release of members of the alarmin family.

16020478|t|Identification of insulin receptor substrate 1 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry analysis: regulatory role of serine 1223.
16020478|t|Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), an intracellular substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, also is heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and several serine phosphorylation sites alter the function of IRS-1. Because of the large number of serine/threonine residues, position-by-position analysis of these potential phosphorylation sites by mutagenesis is difficult. To circumvent this, we have employed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry techniques to scan for serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated in full-length human IRS-1 ectopically expressed in cells using an adenoviral vector. This approach revealed 12 phosphorylation sites on serine or threonine residues, 10 of which were novel sites. Seven of these sites were in proline-directed motifs, whereas five were in arginine-directed sites. Sequence inspection suggested that phosphorylation of Ser1223 might alter the interaction of IRS-1 with the protein tyrosine phosphatase Src homology domain 2 (SH2)-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). Mutation of Ser1223 to alanine to prevent phosphorylation resulted in increased association of SHP-2 with IRS-1, decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in CHO/IR cells, and decreased insulin-stimulated association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase with IRS-1. This mutation had no effect on association of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor. Sequence analysis showed the Ser1223 region to be widely conserved evolutionarily. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser1223 dampens association of IRS-1 with SHP-2, thereby increasing net insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.

11158326|t|SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase SHIP2 associates with the p130(Cas) adapter protein and regulates cellular adhesion and spreading.
11158326|t|In a previous study, we found that the SHIP2 protein became tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with the Shc adapter protein in response to the treatment of cells with growth factors and insulin (T. Habib, J. A. Hejna, R. E. Moses, and S. J. Decker, J. Biol. Chem. 273:18605-18609, 1998). We describe here a novel interaction between SHIP2 and the p130(Cas) adapter protein, a mediator of actin cytoskeleton organization. SHIP2 and p130(Cas) association was detected in anti-SHIP2 immunoprecipitates from several cell types. Reattachment of trypsinized cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 and increased the formation of a complex containing SHIP2 and a faster-migrating tyrosine-phosphorylated form of p130(Cas). The faster-migrating form of p130(Cas) was no longer recognized by antibodies to the amino terminus of p130(Cas) and appeared to be generated through proteolysis. Interaction of the SHIP2 protein with the various forms of p130(Cas) was mediated primarily through the SH2 domain of SHIP2. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SHIP2 localized to focal contacts and to lamellipodia. Increased adhesion was observed in HeLa cells transiently expressing exogenous WT-SHIP2. These effects were not seen with SHIP2 possessing a mutation in the SH2 domain (R47G). Transfection of a catalytic domain deletion mutant of SHIP2 (DeltaRV) inhibited cell spreading. Taken together, our studies suggest an important role for SHIP2 in adhesion and spreading.

17846166|t|Triadin binding to the C-terminal luminal loop of the ryanodine receptor is important for skeletal muscle excitation contraction coupling.
17846166|t|Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores is controlled by complex interactions between multiple proteins. Triadin is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle that interacts with both calsequestrin and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) to communicate changes in luminal Ca(2+) to the release machinery. However, the potential impact of the triadin association with RyR1 in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling remains elusive. Here we show that triadin binding to RyR1 is critically important for rapid Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. To assess the functional impact of the triadin-RyR1 interaction, we expressed RyR1 mutants in which one or more of three negatively charged residues (D4878, D4907, and E4908) in the terminal RyR1 intraluminal loop were mutated to alanines in RyR1-null (dyspedic) myotubes. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that triadin, but not junctin, binding to RyR1 was abolished in the triple (D4878A/D4907A/E4908A) mutant and one of the double (D4907A/E4908A) mutants, partially reduced in the D4878A/D4907A double mutant, but not affected by either individual (D4878A, D4907A, E4908A) mutations or the D4878A/E4908A double mutation. Functional studies revealed that the rate of voltage- and ligand-gated SR Ca(2+) release were reduced in proportion to the degree of interruption in triadin binding. Ryanodine binding, single channel recording, and calcium release experiments conducted on WT and triple mutant channels in the absence of triadin demonstrated that the luminal loop mutations do not directly alter RyR1 function. These findings demonstrate that junctin and triadin bind to different sites on RyR1 and that triadin plays an important role in ensuring rapid Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.

8537363|t|The effect of carboxyl-terminal mutagenesis of Gt alpha on rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding.
8537363|t|The carboxyl terminus of G protein alpha subunits plays an important role in receptor recognition. To identify the amino acids that participate in this interaction, COOH-terminal mutants of alpha t (the transducin alpha subunit) were expressed in vitro and analyzed for their ability to interact with rhodopsin and to bind guanine nucleotide. Gly-348, the reported site of a beta turn, was replaced with other neutral amino acids without severely affecting rhodopsin binding. However, proline substitution abolished rhodopsin interaction, suggesting that flexibility is important at this site. A comparison between C347Y, which lost both rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding, and a mutant substituted with alpha q sequence (D346E/C347Y/G348N/F350V), in which guanine nucleotide binding was restored, implies that distinct motifs maintain the structure of the alpha subunit and are necessary for selective interaction with receptors. Surprisingly, mutants L344A, L349A, F350stop, and stop351A demonstrated a parallel loss of rhodopsin and guanine nucleotide binding. Altered profiles of L344A and F350stop on sucrose density gradients indicate that these mutants may undergo denaturation. The equivalent of alpha tL344A generated in alpha s and alpha i did not show such a severe loss of guanine nucleotide binding, revealing that the alpha t carboxyl terminus is unique in its susceptibility to changes in amino acid sequence.

24375709|t|Contribution of SUN1 mutations to the pathomechanism in muscular dystrophies.
24375709|t|Mutations in several genes encoding nuclear envelope (NE) associated proteins cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). We analyzed fibroblasts from a patient who had a mutation in the EMD gene (p.L84Pfs*6) leading to loss of Emerin and a heterozygous mutation in SUN1 (p.A203V). The second patient harbored a heterozygous mutation in LAP2alpha (p.P426L) and a further mutation in SUN1 (p.A614V). p.A203V is located in the N-terminal domain of SUN1 facing the nucleoplasm and situated in the vicinity of the Nesprin-2 and Emerin binding site. p.A614V precedes the SUN domain, which interacts with the KASH domain of Nesprins in the periplasmic space and forms the center of the LINC complex. At the cellular level, we observed alterations in the amounts for several components of the NE in patient fibroblasts and further phenotypic characteristics generally attributed to laminopathies such as increased sensitivity to heat stress. The defects were more severe than observed in EDMD cells with mutations in a single gene. In particular, in patient fibroblasts carrying the p.A203V mutation in SUN1, the alterations were aggravated. Moreover, SUN1 of both patient fibroblasts exhibited reduced interaction with Lamin A/C and when expressed ectopically in wild-type fibroblasts, the SUN1 mutant proteins exhibited reduced interactions with Emerin as well.

23378270|t|Rsf-1, a chromatin remodelling protein, interacts with cyclin E1 and promotes tumour development.
23378270|t|Chromosome 11q13.5 containing RSF1 (HBXAP), a gene involved in chromatin remodelling, is amplified in several human cancers including ovarian carcinoma. Our previous studies demonstrated requirement of Rsf-1 for cell survival in cancer cells, which contributed to tumour progression; however, its role in tumourigenesis has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we co-immunoprecipitated proteins with Rsf-1 followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and identified cyclin E1, besides SNF2H, as one of the major Rsf-1 interacting proteins. Like RSF1, CCNE1 is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer, and both Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 were found co-up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues. Ectopic expression of Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 in non-tumourigenic TP53(mut) RK3E cells led to an increase in cellular proliferation and tumour formation by activating cyclin E1-associated kinase (CDK2). Tumourigenesis was not detected if either cyclin E1 or Rsf-1 was expressed, or they were expressed in a TP53(wt) background. Domain mapping showed that cyclin E1 interacted with the first 441 amino acids of Rsf-1. Ectopic expression of this truncated domain significantly suppressed G1/S-phase transition, cellular proliferation, and tumour formation of RK3E-p53(R175H) /Rsf-1/cyclin E1 cells. The above findings suggest that Rsf-1 interacts and collaborates with cyclin E1 in neoplastic transformation and TP53 mutations are a prerequisite for tumour-promoting functions of the RSF/cyclin E1 complex.

9710621|t|Activation of Neu (ErbB-2) mediated by disulfide bond-induced dimerization reveals a receptor tyrosine kinase dimer interface.
9710621|t|Receptor dimerization is a crucial intermediate step in activation of signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). However, dimerization of the RTK Neu (also designated ErbB-2, HER-2, and p185(neu)), while necessary, is not sufficient for signaling. Earlier work in our laboratory had shown that introduction of an ectopic cysteine into the Neu juxtamembrane domain induces Neu dimerization but not signaling. Since Neu signaling does require dimerization, we hypothesized that there are additional constraints that govern signaling ability. With the importance of the interreceptor cross-phosphorylation reaction, a likely constraint was the relative geometry of receptors within the dimer. We have tested this possibility by constructing a consecutive series of cysteine substitutions in the Neu juxtamembrane domain in order to force dimerization along a series of interreceptor faces. Within the group that dimerized constitutively, a subset had transforming activity. The substitutions in this subset all mapped to the same face of a predicted alpha helix, the most likely conformation for the intramembrane domain. Furthermore, this face of interaction aligns with the projected Neu* V664E substitution and with a predicted amphipathic interface in the Neu juxtamembrane domain. We propose that these results identify an RTK dimer interface and that dimerization of this RTK induces an extended contact between juxtamembrane and intramembrane alpha helices.

10931950|t|Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase suppresses tumorigenesis in MMTV/Neu + MMTV/TGF-alpha bigenic mice.
10931950|t|Overexpression of ErbB-2/Neu has been causally associated with mammary epithelial transformation. Here we report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase with AG-1478 markedly delays breast tumor formation in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/Neu + MMTV/transforming growth factor alpha bigenic mice. This delay was associated with inhibition of EGFR and Neu signaling, reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities and cyclin D1, and an increase in the levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1). In addition, BrdUrd incorporation into tumor cell nuclei was prevented with no signs of tumor cell apoptosis. These observations prompted us to investigate the stability of p27. Recombinant p27 was degraded rapidly in vitro by untreated but not by AG-1478-treated tumor lysates. Proteasome depletion of the tumor lysates, addition of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U-0126, or a T187A mutation in recombinant p27 all prevented p27 degradation. Cdk2 and MAPK precipitates from untreated tumor lysates phosphorylated recombinant wild-type p27 but not the T187A mutant in vitro. Cdk2 and MAPK precipitates from AG-1478-treated tumors were unable to phosphorylate p27 in vitro. These data suggest that increased signaling by ErbB receptors up-regulates MAPK activity, which, in turn, phosphorylates and destabilizes p27, thus contributing to dysregulated cell cycle progression.

10694430|t|Regulation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF protein levels by association with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme hUBC9.
10694430|t|The basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/ZIP) microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) regulates transcription of genes encoding enzymes essential for melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes and retinal pigmented epithelial cells. To determine how MITF activity is regulated, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins expressed by human melanoma cells that interact with MITF. The majority of clones that showed positive interaction with a 158-amino-acid region of MITF containing the bHLH/ZIP domain (aa 168-325) encoded the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme hUBC9. The association of MITF with hUBC9 was further confirmed by an in vitro GST pull-down assay. Although hUBC9 is known to interact preferentially with SENTRIN/SUMO1, in vitro transcription/translation analysis demonstrated greater association of MITF with ubiquitin than with SENTRIN. Importantly, cotransfection of MITF and hUBC9 expression vectors resulted in MITF protein degradation. MITF protein was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in MITF degradation. Serine 73, which is located in a region rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST), regulates MITF protein stability, since a serine to alanine mutation prevented hUBC9-mediated MITF (S73A) degradation. Furthermore, we identified lysine 201 as a potential ubiquitination site. A lysine to arginine mutation abolished MITF (K201R) degradation by hUBC9 in vivo. Our experiments indicate that by targeting MITF for proteasome degradation, hUBC9 is a critical regulator of melanocyte differentiation.

9252386|t|The role of the Shc phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding domain and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in polyoma middle T antigen-mediated cell transformation.
9252386|t|The phosphotyrosine interaction (PI)/phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Shc binds specific tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs found on activated growth factor receptors and proteins such as polyoma virus middle T antigen (MT). Phenylalanine 198 (Phe198) has been identified as a crucial residue involved in the interaction of the Shc PI/PTB with phosphopeptides. In NIH 3T3 cells expressing MT, p52 Shc carrying the F198V mutation is weakly phosphorylated and does not bind MT or Grb2. Overexpression of the PI/PTB domain alone as Shc amino acids 1-238 acted in a dominant interfering fashion blocking MT-induced transformation. However, expression of a slightly longer construct, Shc 1-260, which encompasses Tyr239/Tyr240, a novel Shc tyrosine phosphorylation site, did not block transformation. This was found to be due to the ability of Shc 1-260 to become tyrosine-phosphorylated and bind Grb2. Furthermore, full-length Shc in which Tyr239/Tyr240 had been mutated to phenylalanine did not become tyrosine-phosphorylated or bind Grb2 but did inhibit colony formation in soft agar. Conversely, p52 Shc carrying a mutation in the other tyrosine phosphorylation site, Tyr317, became heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated, bound Grb2, and gave rise to colonies in soft agar.

27758855|t|Core Binding Factor β Protects HIV, Type 1 Accessory Protein Viral Infectivity Factor from MDM2-mediated Degradation.
27758855|t|HIV, type 1 overcomes host restriction factor apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) proteins by organizing an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex together with viral infectivity factor (Vif) and a host transcription cofactor core binding factor β (CBFβ). CBFβ is essential for Vif to counteract APOBEC3 by enabling the recruitment of cullin 5 to the complex and increasing the steady-state level of Vif protein; however, the mechanisms by which CBFβ up-regulates Vif protein remains unclear. Because we have reported previously that mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an E3 ligase for Vif, we hypothesized that CBFβ might protect Vif from MDM2-mediated degradation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that Vif mutants that do not bind to CBFβ preferentially interact with MDM2 and that overexpression of CBFβ disrupts the interaction between MDM2 and Vif. Knockdown of CBFβ reduced the steady-state level of Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells. Cycloheximide chase analyses revealed that Vif E88A/W89A, which does not interact with CBFβ, degraded faster than wild-type Vif in MDM2-proficient cells but not in MDM2-null cells, suggesting that Vif stabilization by CBFβ is mainly caused by impairing MDM2-mediated degradation. We identified Vif R93E as a Vif variant that does not bind to MDM2, and the virus with this substitution mutation was more resistant to APOBEC3G than the parental virus. Combinatory substitution of Vif residues required for CBFβ binding and MDM2 binding showed full recovery of Vif steady-state levels, supporting our hypothesis. Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of Vif augmentation by CBFβ.

11024046|t|Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha binds to thrombin anion-binding exosite II inducing allosteric changes in the activity of thrombin.
11024046|t|The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a platelet surface receptor that binds thrombin as one of its ligands, although the biological significance of thrombin interaction remains unclear. In this study we have used several approaches to investigate the GPIb alpha-thrombin interaction in more detail and to study its effect on the thrombin-induced elaboration of fibrin. We found that both glycocalicin and the amino-terminal fragment of GPIb alpha reduced the release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen by about 50% by a noncompetitive allosteric mechanism. Similarly, GPIb alpha caused in thrombin an allosteric reduction in the rate of turnover of the small peptide substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA. The K(d) for the glycocalicin-thrombin interaction was 1 microm at physiological ionic strength but was highly salt-dependent, decreasing to 0.19 microm at 100 mm NaCl (Gamma(salt) = -4.2). The salt dependence was characteristic of other thrombin ligands that bind to exosite II of this enzyme, and we confirmed this as the GPIb alpha-binding site on thrombin by using thrombin mutants and by competition binding studies. R68E or R70E mutations in exosite I of thrombin had little effect on its interaction with GPIb alpha. Both the allosteric inhibition of fibrinogen turnover caused by GPIb alpha binding to these mutants, and the K(d) values for their interactions with GPIb alpha were similar to those of wild-type thrombin. In contrast, R89E and K248E mutations in exosite II of thrombin markedly increased the K(d) values for the interactions of these thrombin mutants with GPIb alpha by 10- and 25-fold, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (which binds to thrombin exosite II) but not hirugen (residues 54-65 of hirudin, which binds to exosite I of thrombin) inhibited thrombin binding to GPIb alpha. These data demonstrate that GPIb alpha binds to thrombin exosite II and in so doing causes a conformational change in the active site of thrombin by an allosteric mechanism that alters the accessibility of both its natural substrate, fibrinogen, and the small peptidyl substrate d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA.

12038791|t|Platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex mediates high-shear dependent platelet activation through an interaction with the von Willebrand factor (vWF). All four subunits of the complex have a structural motif, the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequence, with leucines in conserved positions. Here we report a new polymorphism, Leu/Phe at residue 70 of GPIbalpha, which disrupts the consensus sequence of the LRR in the vWF binding domain. Genotype frequencies among 142 healthy Japanese subjects were 92.3%, 7.7%, and 0.0%, for the 70Leu/Leu, 70Leu/Phe, and 75Phe/Phe genotypes, respectively. Ristocetin-induced or shear-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly different between the 70Leu/Leu and 70Leu/Phe genotypes. In in vitro studies, a recombinant GPIbalpha fragment with 70Phe (L70F) as compared to that with 70Leu (WT) had low reactivity to anti-GPIbalpha monoclonal antibodies, GUR20-5 and Hip1, both of which recognize conformation-specific epitopes within the 45-kDa domain. Ristocetin-induced 125I-vWF binding to L70F, however, did not differ from that to WT.

9918721|t|Association of holliday-structure resolving endonuclease VII with gp20 from the packaging machine of phage T4.
9918721|t|Endonuclease VII (endo VII) is the product of gene 49 (gp49) of bacteriophage T4. It is a Holliday-structure resolvase (X-solvase) responsible for clearing branched replicative DNA prior to packaging. Consequently, mutations in gene 49 are unable to fill heads to completion because unresolved branches stop translocation of DNA. A likely association of gp49 with heads or proheads, however, could not be shown in the past. We have investigated whether gp49 could be part of the transiently assembled packaging machine (the "packasome") located at the base of proheads. Using purified proteins gpl6, gpl7 and gp20, which are constituents of the packasome, we found that gp49 binds tightly to gp20 and does not bind to gpl6 or gpl7. Quantification revealed that one dimer of gp49 binds one monomer of gp20. Notably, dimerisation of gp49 was an essential prerequisite for complex formation with gp20, and the dimerisation-deficient point mutation His-EVII-W87R showed only residual affinity to gp20. Furthermore, truncated peptides of gp49 deficient in dimer formation to various degrees were found to be impaired in binding to gp20. In contrast, the cleavage-deficient mutation EVII-N62D bound normally to gp20. The cruciform DNA (cf-DNA) resolving activity typical of endo VII is maintained in gp20-gp49 complexes. Furthermore, the complexes bind cf-DNA in the absence of Mg2+ as demonstrated by electromobility shift assays. The binding of the complexes to cf-DNA occurs via gp49, since gp20 alone does not bind cf-DNA. In conclusion, these findings are consistent with a model in which gp49 is an integral part of the packaging machine of phage T4.

We reported previously that a recombinant fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the N-terminal domain of G(M) [GST-G(M)-(1-240)] bound PP1 in a pull down assay, and phosphorylation by PKA prevented PP1 binding. Here we report that substitution of either Ala or Val for Ser-67 in the RVS(67)F motif in GST-G(M)-(1-240) essentially eliminated PP1 binding. This was unexpected because other glycogen-targeting subunits have a Val residue at the position corresponding to Ser-67. In contrast, a mutation of Ser-67 to Thr (S67T) in GST-G(M)(1-240) gave a protein that bound PP1 the same as wild type and was unaffected by PKA phosphorylation. Full length G(M) tagged with the epitope sequence DYKDDDDK (FLAG) expressed in COS7 cells bound PP1 that was recovered by co-immunoprecipitation, but this association was prevented by treatment of the cells with forskolin. By comparison, PP1 binding with FLAG-G(M)(S67T) was not disrupted by forskolin treatment. Neither FLAG-G(M)(S67A) nor FLAG-G(M)(S67V) formed stable complexes with PP1 in COS7 cells. These results emphasise the unique contribution of Ser-67 in PP1 binding to G(M). The constitutive PP1-binding activity shown by G(M)(S67T) opens the way for studying the role of G(M) multisite phosphorylation in hormonal control of glycogen metabolism.

9368069|t|Discrimination of amino acids mediating Ras binding from noninteracting residues affecting raf activation by double mutant analysis.
9368069|t|The contribution of residues outside the Ras binding domain of Raf (RafRBD) to Ras-Raf interaction and Ras-dependent Raf activation has remained unresolved. Here, we utilize a double mutant approach to identify complementary interacting amino acids that are involved in Ras-Raf interaction and activation. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 from RafRBD are interacting residues complementary to Ras-Glu37 located in the Ras effector region. Raf-Arg59 and Raf-Arg67 also mediate interaction with Ras-Glu37 in Ras-dependent Raf activation. The characteristics observed here can be used as criteria for a role of residues from other regions of Raf in Ras-Raf interaction and activation. We developed a quantitative two-hybrid system as a tool to investigate the effect of point mutations on protein-protein interactions that elude biochemical analysis of bacterially expressed proteins. This assay shows that Raf-Ser257 in the RafCR2 domain does not contribute to Ras-Raf interaction and that the Raf-S257L mutation does not restore Raf binding to Ras-E37G. Yet, Raf-S257L displays high constitutive kinase activity and further activation by Ras-G12V/E37G is still impaired as compared with activation by Ras-G12V. This strongly suggests that the RafCR2 domain is an independent domain involved in the control of Raf activity and a common mechanism for constitutively activating mutants may be the interference with the inactive ground state of the kinase.

8756622|t|Interaction of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 tax transactivator with transcription factor IIA.
8756622|t|The Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a 40-kDa transcriptional activator which is critical for HTLV-1 gene regulation and virus-induced cellular transformation. Tax is localized to the DNA through its interaction with the site-specific activators cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein, NF-kappaB, and serum response factor. It has been suggested that the recruitment of Tax to the DNA positions Tax for interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. On the basis of several independent assays, we now report a physical and functional interaction between Tax and the transcription factor, TFIIA. First, Tax was found to interact with the 35-kDa (alpha) subunit of TFIIA in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Importantly, two previously characterized mutants with point mutations in Tax, M32 (Y196A, K197S) and M41 (H287A, P288S), which were shown to be defective in Tax-activated transcription were unable to interact with TFIIA in this assay. Second, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) affinity-binding assay showed that the interaction of holo-TFIIA with GST-Tax was 20-fold higher than that observed with either the GST-Tax M32 activation mutant or the GST control. Third, a coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that in HTLV-1-infected human T lymphocytes, Tax and TFIIA were associated. Finally, TFIIA facilitates Tax transactivation in vitro and in vivo. In vitro transcription studies showed reduced levels of Tax-activated transcription in cell extracts depleted of TFIIA. In addition, transfection of human T lymphocytes with TFIIA expression vectors enhanced Tax-activated transcription of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct. Our study suggests that the interaction of Tax with the transcription factor TFIIA may play a role in Tax-mediated transcriptional activation.

11311142|t|Determination of interaction sites of phospholipase D1 for RhoA.
11311142|t|Phospholipase D (PLD) is regulated by many factors, including protein kinase C (PKC) and small G-proteins of the Rho and ADP-ribosylation factor families. Previous studies revealed that the interaction site of human PLD(1) for RhoA is located in its C-terminus, but the exact locus has not been determined. The purpose of the present study was to determine the interaction site of rat PLD(1) (rPLD(1)) with RhoA. Selection with phage display of different peptides of rPLD(1) confirmed that GTP-bound RhoA interacted with a site in the amino acid sequence 873-1024 at the C-terminus of rPLD(1). RhoA also associated with this peptide in a GTP-dependent manner in COS-7 cell lysates and the peptide inhibited RhoA stimulation of PLD activity in membranes from COS-7 cells expressing rPLD(1). A series of alanine mutations of non-conserved residues were made in this sequence, and the enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and checked for responses to activation of PKC, which interacts with the N-terminus of PLD(1), and also to the constitutively active V14RhoA. Mutations in the C-terminus of rPLD(1) (K946A, V950A, R955A and K962A) caused partial loss of V14RhoA stimulation, and double mutations (K946A/K962A, K946A/V950A and K962A/V950A) caused an almost total loss. Co-immunoprecipitation studies also showed that the mutated forms of rPLD(1) described above failed to bind V14RhoA compared with wild-type rPLD(1), whereas rPLD(1) with mutations outside the region K946-K962 bound V14RhoA normally. It is concluded that basic amino acids in a restricted C-terminal region of rPLD(1) are important for binding of RhoA and its activation of PLD activity.

22496359|t|Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-binding protein, PI3KAP/XB130, is required for cAMP-induced amplification of IGF mitogenic activity in FRTL-5 thyroid cells.
22496359|t|We previously demonstrated that long-term pretreatment of rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells with TSH or cAMP-generating reagents potentiated IGF-I-dependent DNA synthesis. Under these conditions, cAMP treatment increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125-kDa protein (p125) and its association with a p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85 PI3K), which were suggested to mediate potentiation of DNA synthesis. This study was undertaken to identify p125 and to elucidate its roles in potentiation of DNA synthesis induced by IGF-I. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed p125 to be a rat ortholog of human XB130, which we named PI3K-associated protein (PI3KAP). cAMP treatment elevated PI3KAP/XB130 mRNA and protein levels as well as tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with p85 PI3K leading to increased PI3K activities associated with PI3KAP/XB130, supporting the role of PI3KAP/XB130 in DNA synthesis potentiation. Importantly, PI3KAP/XB130 knockdown attenuated cAMP-dependent potentiation of IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis. Furthermore, c-Src was associated with PI3KAP/XB130 and was activated in response to cAMP. Addition of Src family kinase inhibitors, PP1 or PP2, during cAMP treatment abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3KAP/XB130 and its interaction with p85 PI3K. Finally, introduction of PI3KAP/XB130 into NIH3T3 fibroblasts lacking endogenous PI3KAP/XB130 enhanced IGF-I-induced DNA synthesis; however, a mutant Y72F incapable of binding to p85 PI3K did not show this response. Together, these data indicate that cAMP-dependent induction of PI3KAP/XB130, which is associated with PI3K, is required for enhancement of IGF mitogenic activities.

10022517|t|180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen/type XVII collagen: tissue-specific expression and molecular interactions with keratin 18.
10022517|t|The 180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2) is a hemidesmosomal transmembrane protein, also known as type XVII collagen. In this study, potential interactions of BPAG2 with other proteins expressed in epidermal keratinocytes were explored by yeast two-hybrid system using the amino-terminal intracellular domain of BPAG2 as a bait. Several independent interacting clones encoding keratin 18 (K18) were identified when the keratinocyte cDNA library, cloned into the yeast two-hybrid activation domain vector, was screened. The peptide sequence responsible for the interaction of BPAG2 was restricted to amino acids 15-25, and substitution of a valine residue in the middle of this sequence by a proline (V23P) by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the interaction. Further examination of the K18 sequences by restricted cDNA constructs in yeast two-hybrid system identified a carboxyl-terminal segment corresponding to helix 2B domain as critical for BPAG2 binding. The interaction of BPAG2/K18 was confirmed by an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, which also confirmed that normal human keratinocytes express K18 in culture. The tissue specific expression of BPAG2 was first examined using a multi-tissue RNA blot. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels representing a variety of adult and fetal tissues as well as tumor cells were used as PCR-templates to study the expression patterns of both BPAG2 and K18. The results demonstrated significant level of expression of BPAG2, besides in epidermal keratinocytes, also in a variety of tissues with predominant epithelial component, such as mammary, salivary and thyroid glands, colon, prostate, testis, placenta, and adult and fetal thymus, as well as in colon, pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, and an ovarian carcinoma. As expected, K18 transcript is present in liver, pancreas, colon, placenta, and in fetal kidney. Collectively, the results suggest that BPAG2 has a relatively broad tissue distribution including specialized and simple epithelia, and that within the tissues such as colon and placenta, BPAG2 may have direct interactions with K18, a keratin characteristically expressed in a simple epithelia.

11063739|t|Direct interaction of Rab4 with syntaxin 4.
11063739|t|In the present study, we examined the possible interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4, both having been implicated in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Rab4 and syntaxin 4 were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates of electrically permeabilized rat adipocytes. The interaction between the two proteins was reduced by insulin treatment and increased by the addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS). An in vitro binding assay revealed that the bacterially expressed Rab4 was bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 4 (GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273)) but not to syntaxin 1A or vesicle-associated membrane protein-2. The interaction between Rab4 and syntaxin 4 seemed to be regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4, because 1) GTPgammaS treatment of the cells significantly increased, but guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDPbetaS) treatment decreased the amount of Rab4 pulled down with GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273) from the cell lysates; 2) GTPgammaS loading on Rab4 caused a marked increase in the affinity of Rab4 to syntaxin 4 whereas GDPbetaS loading had little effect; and 3) a GTPase-deficient mutant of Rab4 (Rab4(Q67L)), but not a GTP-binding-defective mutant (Rab4(S22N)), was bound to GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273). Although insulin stimulated [gamma-(32)P]GTP binding to Rab4 in a time-dependent fashion, its effect on the Rab4 interaction with syntaxin 4 was apparently biphasic; an initial increase in Rab4 associated with syntaxin 4 was followed by a gradual dissociation of the GTPase from syntaxin 4. Finally, the binding of Rab4(Q67L) to GST-syntaxin 4-(1-273) was inhibited by munc-18c in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GTP-loaded Rab4 binds to syntaxin 4 in the open conformation. These results suggest that 1) Rab4 interacts with syntaxin 4 in a direct and specific manner, and 2) the interaction is regulated by the guanine nucleotide status of Rab4 as well as by the conformational status of syntaxin 4.

18093912|t|Mutation of an A-kinase-anchoring protein causes long-QT syndrome.
18093912|t|A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) recruit signaling molecules and present them to downstream targets to achieve efficient spatial and temporal control of their phosphorylation state. In the heart, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD), mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, requires assembly of AKAP9 (Yotiao) with the I(Ks) potassium channel alpha subunit (KCNQ1). KCNQ1 mutations that disrupt this complex cause type 1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1), one of the potentially lethal heritable arrhythmia syndromes. Here, we report identification of (i) regions on Yotiao critical to its binding to KCNQ1 and (ii) a single putative LQTS-causing mutation (S1570L) in AKAP9 (Yotiao) localized to the KCNQ1 binding domain in 1/50 (2%) subjects with a clinically robust phenotype for LQTS but absent in 1,320 reference alleles. The inherited S1570L mutation reduces the interaction between KCNQ1 and Yotiao, reduces the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of the channel, eliminates the functional response of the I(Ks) channel to cAMP, and prolongs the action potential in a computational model of the ventricular cardiocyte. These reconstituted cellular consequences of the inherited S1570L-Yotiao mutation are consistent with delayed repolarization of the ventricular action potential observed in the affected siblings. Thus, we have demonstrated a link between genetic perturbations in AKAP and human disease in general and AKAP9 and LQTS in particular.

23653349|t|p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) can promote ERK activation in a kinase-independent manner.
23653349|t|PAK1 plays an important role in proliferation and tumorigenesis, at least partially by promoting ERK phosphorylation of C-RAF (Ser-338) or MEK1 (Ser-298). We observed how that overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant form of PAK1 increased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221) and ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), although phosphorylation of B-RAF (Ser-445) and C-RAF (Ser-338) remained unchanged. Furthermore, increased activation of the PAK1 activator Rac1 induced the formation of a triple complex of Rac1, PAK1, and MEK1 independent of the kinase activity of PAK1. These data suggest that PAK1 can stimulate MEK activity in a kinase-independent manner, probably by serving as a scaffold to facilitate interaction of C-RAF.

19933215|t|Disease-causing mutations within the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) reveal the nature of binding to its ligand beta-glucocerebrosidase.
19933215|t|Action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF) is caused by mutations in the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2/SCARB2). LIMP-2 was identified as a sorting receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase (beta-GC), which is defective in Gaucher disease. To date, six AMRF-causing mutations have been described, including splice site, missense and nonsense mutations. All mutations investigated in this study lead to a retention of LIMP-2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but affect the binding to beta-GC differentially. From the three nonsense mutations, only the Q288X mutation was still able to bind to beta-GC as efficiently as compared with wild-type LIMP-2, whereas the W146SfsX16 and W178X mutations lost their beta-GC-binding capacity almost completely. The LIMP-2 segment 145-288, comprising the nonsense mutations, contains a highly conserved coiled-coil domain, which we suggest determines beta-GC binding. In fact, disruption of the helical arrangement and amphiphatic nature of the coiled-coil domain abolishes beta-GC binding, and a synthetic peptide comprising the coiled-coil domain of LIMP-2 displays pH-selective multimerization properties. In contrast to the reduced binding properties of the nonsense mutations, the only missense mutation (H363N) found in AMRF leads to increased binding of beta-GC to LIMP-2, indicating that this highly conserved histidine modifies the affinity of LIMP-2 to its ligand. With the present study, we demonstrate that disruption of the coiled-coil structure or AMRF disease-causing mutations abolish beta-GC binding, indicating the importance of an intact coiled-coil structure for the interaction of LIMP-2 and beta-GC.

9190208|t|Cyclin D1/Cdk4 regulates retinoblastoma protein-mediated cell cycle arrest by site-specific phosphorylation.
9190208|t|The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) inhibits progression through the cell cycle. Although pRb is phosphorylated when G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are active, the mechanisms underlying pRb regulation are unknown. In vitro phosphorylation by cyclin D1/Cdk4 leads to inactivation of pRb in a microinjection-based in vivo cell cycle assay. In contrast, phosphorylation of pRb by Cdk2 or Cdk3 in complexes with A- or E-type cyclins is not sufficient to inactivate pRb function in this assay, despite extensive phosphorylation and conversion to a slowly migrating "hyperphosphorylated form." The differential effects of phosphorylation on pRb function coincide with modification of distinct sets of sites. Serine 795 is phosphorylated efficiently by Cdk4, even in the absence of an intact LXCXE motif in cyclin D, but not by Cdk2 or Cdk3. Mutation of serine 795 to alanine prevents pRb inactivation by Cdk4 phosphorylation in the microinjection assay. This study identifies a residue whose phosphorylation is critical for inactivation of pRb-mediated growth suppression, and it indicates that hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of pRb are not necessarily synonymous.

23897824|t|SHANK3 gene mutations associated with autism facilitate ligand binding to the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region.
23897824|t|Shank/ProSAP proteins are major scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density; mutations in the human SHANK3 gene are associated with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders. We have analyzed the functional relevance of several SHANK3 missense mutations affecting the N-terminal portion of the protein by expression of wild-type and mutant Shank3 in cultured neurons and by binding assays in heterologous cells. Postsynaptic targeting of recombinant Shank3 was unaltered. In electrophysiological experiments, both wild-type and L68P mutant forms of Shank3 were equally effective in restoring synaptic function after knockdown of endogenous Shank3. We observed that several mutations affected binding to interaction partners of the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region. One of these mutations, L68P, improved binding to both ligands. Leu-68 is located N-terminal to the ankyrin repeats, in a highly conserved region that we identify here as a novel domain termed the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain. We show that the SPN domain interacts with the ankyrin repeats in an intramolecular manner, thereby restricting access of either Sharpin or α-fodrin. The L68P mutation disrupts this blockade, thus exposing the Shank3 ankyrin repeat region to its ligands. Our data identify a new type of regulation of Shank proteins and suggest that mutations in the SHANK3 gene do not necessarily induce a loss of function, but may represent a gain of function with respect to specific interaction partners.

8183372|t|Binding of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase to CD28 is required for T-cell signalling.
8183372|t|The engagement of CD28 with its ligand B7.1/CD80 results in potent costimulation of T-cell activation initiated through the CD3/T-cell receptor complex. The biochemical basis of CD28 costimulatory function is poorly understood. The signalling pathways used by CD28 are unlike those used by the CD3/T-cell receptor in that they are resistant to cyclosporin A and independent of changes in cyclic AMP concentrations. These differences suggest that each pathway provides unique biochemical information which is required for T-cell activation. We report here that CD28 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following interaction with B7.1/CD80, which induces formation of a complex with phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, mediated by the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of the kinase. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase is a heterodimer of this 85K regulatory subunit and a 110K catalytic subunit, and is a common substrate for most receptor tyrosine kinases and some cytokine receptors, binding through its SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine in the motif Tyr-X-X-Met in the CD28 sequence, which is highly conserved between human, mouse and rat and lies in the intracellular domain. We show that CD28 mutants that have their kinase-binding site deleted or the tyrosine at position 173 substituted by phenylalanine do not associate with the kinase after CD28 stimulation and cannot stimulate production of interleukin-2. Our results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase is critical for signalling by CD28.

8911681|t|Emerging components of the Crk oncogene product: the first identified adaptor protein.
8911681|t|v-Crk, identified as an oncogene product of the CT10 retrovirus, became the first example of an adaptor protein. It consists mostly of the Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Two of the three major proteins bound to Crk SH2 have been identified as paxillin and p130Cas. Both paxillin and p130Cas are phosphorylated upon stimulation by integrin, suggesting that Crk transduces signals from integrin. The cloning of the complementary DNA of two major proteins bound to Crk SH3 was recently completed. Both cDNAs encoded novel proteins: C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Rap1, and DOCK180, an SH3-containing protein of unknown function. The SH3 domain of Crk also binds to Sos, Abl, and Eps15. The variety of the proteins bound to Crk SH3 implies that Crk provides a set of effector proteins that are triggered together. Alternatively, other domains of the SH3-binding proteins enable Crk to specifically activate each of the SH3-binding proteins according to the particular form of stimulation.

12036950|t|Human papillomavirus E6-induced degradation of E6TP1 is mediated by E6AP ubiquitin ligase.
12036950|t|High-risk human papilloma viruses are known to be associated with cervical cancers. We have reported previously that the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein interacts with E6TP1, a novel Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP). Similar to p53 tumor suppressor protein, the high-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins target E6TP1 for degradation. The HPV16 E6-induced degradation of E6TP1 strongly correlates with its ability to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells. In this study, we used treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132, analysis in CHO-ts20 cells with a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and direct detection of ubiquitin-modified E6TP1 to demonstrate that E6TP1 is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway both in the presence and in the absence of E6. Using deletion mutants of E6TP1, we mapped the region required and sufficient for E6 binding to COOH-terminal 40 amino acid residues and showed this region to be necessary for E6-dependent degradation of E6TP1. Furthermore, the E6-binding region of E6TP1 complexes with E6AP via E6. Importantly, the purified E6AP enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of E6TP1 in the presence of E6 in vitro. Additionally, the expression of a dominant-negative E6AP mutant (C833A) in cells inhibited the E6-induced degradation of E6TP1. These findings demonstrate that the E6-induced decrease in the levels of E6TP1 protein involves the E6AP-mediated ubiquitination followed by proteasome-dependent degradation.

21965652|t|Phosphorylation of MCM3 protein by cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) regulates its function in cell cycle.
21965652|t|MCM2-7 proteins form a stable heterohexamer with DNA helicase activity functioning in the DNA replication of eukaryotic cells. The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of MCM2-7 proteins contributes to the formation of the MCM2-7 complex. However, the regulation of specific MCM phosphorylation still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that MCM3 is a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 and can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at Thr-722. We find that the MCM3 T722A mutant binds chromatin much less efficiently when compared with wild type MCM3, suggesting that this phosphorylation site is involved in MCM3 loading onto chromatin. Interestingly, overexpression of MCM3, but not MCM3 T722A mutant, inhibits the S phase entry, whereas it does not affect the exit from mitosis. Knockdown of MCM3 does not affect S phase entry and progression, indicating that a small fraction of MCM3 is sufficient for normal S phase completion. These results suggest that excess accumulation of MCM3 protein onto chromatin may inhibit DNA replication. Other studies indicate that excess of MCM3 up-regulates the phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser-345 and CDK2 Thr-14. These data reveal that the phosphorylation of MCM3 contributes to its function in controlling the S phase checkpoint of cell cycle in addition to the regulation of formation of the MCM2-7 complex.

17158150|t|LEDGF/p75 interacts with divergent lentiviral integrases and modulates their enzymatic activity in vitro.
17158150|t|Transcriptional co-activator LEDGF/p75 is the major cellular interactor of HIV-1 integrase (IN), critical to efficient viral replication. In this work, a series of INs from the Betaretrovirus, Gammaretrovirus, Deltaretrovirus, Spumavirus and Lentivirus retroviral genera were tested for interaction with the host factor. None of the non-lentiviral INs possessed detectable affinity for LEDGF in either pull-down or yeast two-hybrid assays. In contrast, all lentiviral INs examined, including those from bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), maedi-visna virus (MVV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) readily interacted with LEDGF. Mutation of Asp-366 to Asn in LEDGF ablated the interaction, suggesting a common mechanism of the host factor recognition by the INs. LEDGF potently stimulated strand transfer activity of divergent lentiviral INs in vitro. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of the host factor, EIAV IN almost exclusively catalyzed concerted integration, whereas HIV-1 IN promoted predominantly half-site integration, and BIV IN was equally active in both types of strand transfer. Concerted BIV and EIAV integration resulted in 5 bp duplications of the target DNA sequences. These results confirm that the interaction with LEDGF is conserved within and limited to Lentivirus and strongly argue that the host factor is intimately involved in the catalysis of lentiviral DNA integration.

15735705|t|Phosphorylation of MdmX by CDK2/Cdc2(p34) is required for nuclear export of Mdm2.
15735705|t|Mdm2 and MdmX function as cellular regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Intriguingly, the activities of these proteins are interdependent; MdmX stabilizes Mdm2, enabling its activities towards p53, but it also requires Mdm2 for its nuclear localization. Here we demonstrate that via its phosphorylation by CDK2/Cdc2p34, MdmX regulates nuclear export of Mdm2. Cdc2p34 phosphorylates MdmX on Ser 96 in vitro. Mutation within this site (MdmX(S96A)) impairs, whereas phosphomimic substitution (MdmX(S96D)) increases the cytoplasmic localization of MdmX, suggesting that CDK2/Cdc2p34 phosphorylation is required for export of MdmX from the nucleus. Consequently, cells that express MdmX(S96A) retain Mdm2 in their nuclei, suggesting that export of Mdm2 to the cytoplasm is MdmX-dependent. Similarly, treatment of cells with the pharmacological inhibitor of CDK2/Cdc2p34 or with a dominant-negative Cdc2 results in nuclear localization of MdmX and Mdm2 and decreases the level of Mdm2 expression. Since Cdc2p34 is active in nonstressed conditions, our finding provides a novel insight into the signaling cascade involved in the regulation of MdmX localization and for regulation of Mdm2 localization and stability.

19885567|t|Thioredoxin2 enhances the damaged DNA binding activity of mtTFA through direct interaction.
19885567|t|Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) is a member of the HMG (high mobility group)-box protein family. We previously showed that mtTFA preferentially binds to both cisplatin-damaged and oxidatively damaged DNA. In this study, we found that expression levels of both mtTFA and the mitochondrial antioxidant protein thioredoxin2 (TRX2) are upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. In addition, TRX2 directly interacts with mtTFA and enhances its damaged DNA binding activity. The interaction between mtTFA and TRX2 requires the HMG box 1 motif of mtTFA. Furthermore, when amino acid substitutions were introduced at either C49G or C246stop, TRX2 interacted with mtTFA. However, the interaction of TRX2 with mtTFA was enhanced when both mutations (C49G and C246stop) were introduced. Binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA was similar among mutant mtTFA proteins. By contrast, binding to oxidized DNA was significantly enhanced when double mutations were introduced. These results suggest that TRX2 not only functions as an antioxidant, but also supports mtTFA functions.

9593259|t|Role of the adapter protein CRKL in signal transduction of normal hematopoietic and BCR/ABL-transformed cells.
9593259|t|CRKL is a 39 kDa adapter protein, originally cloned in proximity to the BCR gene on chromosome 22, which has a key regulatory role in hematopoietic cells. CRKL has one SH2 and two SH3 domains, with 60% homology to CRK II. CRKL is a prominent substrate of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein in chronic myelogenous leukemia and binds to both BCR/ABL and c-ABL. CRKL has been shown to be tryosine phosphorylated in response to normal hematopoietic growth factor receptor signaling with ligands such as thrombopoietin, erythropoietin or steel factor. Additionally, CRKL is involved in signaling initiated by crosslinking of beta integrins, and B cell or T cell receptors. Structurally, the amino-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL has been shown to bind proteins such as C3G, SOS, PI3-K, c-ABL or BCR/ABL. The SH2 domain of CRKL can bind to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins such as CBL, HEF1, CAS or paxillin. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the function of this unique adapter protein in normal hematopoietic and leukemic cell signaling.

15140974|t|Complementation of a binding-defective retrovirus by a host cell receptor mutant.
15140974|t|The entry of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) into cells requires the interaction of the envelope protein (Env) with its receptor, mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mATRC1). An aspartic acid-to-lysine change at position 84 (D84K) of ecotropic Moloney MLV Env abolishes virus binding and infection. We recently identified lysine 234 (rK234) in mATRC1 as a residue that influences virus binding and infection. Here we show that D84K virus infection increased 3,000-fold on cells expressing receptor with an rK234A change and 100,000-fold on cells expressing an rK234D change. The stronger complementation of D84K virus infection by rK234D than by the rK234A receptor suggests that although the major reason for loss of infection of D84K and D84R virus is due to steric hindrance and charge repulsion, the loss of an interaction of D84 with receptor appears to contribute as well. Taken together, these results indicate that D84 is very close to rK234 of mATRC1 in the bound complex and there is likely an interaction between them. The definitive localization of the receptor binding site on SU should facilitate the design of chimeric envelope proteins that target infection to new receptors by replacing the receptor binding site with an exogenous ligand sequence.

9537673|t|Role of Lys215 located in the fifth transmembrane domain of the AT2 receptor in ligand-receptor interaction.
9537673|t|Studies on ligand-receptor interaction of Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type 1 have shown that for peptidic ligands to bind this receptor they must interact via their C-terminal carboxylate group to the positively charged side chain of the Lysine residue 199 located in the fifth transmembrane domain of this receptor. In the Ang II receptor type AT2, this Lysine residue is conserved at position 215 in the fifth transmembrane domain. To determine the specific mechanism of ligand binding to the Angiotensin II receptor type AT2, mutated AT2 receptors were generated in which the Lys215 was replaced with glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine and arginine. The ability of these mutated receptors to bind peptidic ligands 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II (non-specific for AT2 receptor type), 125I-CGP42112A (AT2 receptor specific) and the non-peptidic ligand PD123319 (AT2 receptor specific) was evaluated by expressing these receptors in Xenopus oocytes and performing binding assays. The Lys215Glu and Lys215Gln mutants of AT2 receptor lost their affinity to 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II, but retained their affinity to 125I-CGP42112A and PD123319. In contrast, Lys215Arg mutant retained its affinity to 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II, but exhibited lower affinity to 125I-CGP42112A. The Lys215Ala mutant lost its affinity to both 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II and 125I-CGP42112A. These results suggest that the binding mechanism of 125I-[Sar1-Ile8]Ang II to AT2 receptor is similar to that of AT1 receptor since an amino acid with positively charged side chain (Lys or Arg) located in the fifth transmembrane domain is required for this ligand to bind AT2 receptor. In contrast, although CGP42112A is a peptidic ligand, it does not require an interaction between its C-terminal carboxylate group and the positively charged side-chain of an amino acid in the fifth transmembrane domain for its binding to AT2 receptor.

21345796|t|B-Raf associates with and activates the NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger.
21345796|t|The serine/threonine kinase B-Raf is the second most frequently occurring human oncogene after Ras. Mutations of B-Raf occur with the highest incidences in melanoma, and the most common mutant, V600E, renders B-Raf constitutively active. The sodium proton exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein responsible for regulating intracellular pH, cell volume, cell migration, and proliferation. A screen of protein kinases that bind to NHE1 revealed that B-Raf bound to the cytosolic regulatory tail of NHE1. Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 from HeLa and HEK cells confirmed the association of B-Raf with NHE1 in vivo. The expressed and purified C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein were also shown to associate with B-Raf protein in vitro. Because treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib decreased NHE1 activity in HeLa and HEK cells, we examined the role of B-Raf in regulating NHE1 in malignant melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with the B-Raf(V600E) mutation demonstrated increased resting intracellular pH that was dependent on elevated NHE1 activity. NHE1 activity after an acute acid load was also elevated in these cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of B-Raf activity by either sorafenib, PLX4720, or siRNA reduction of B-Raf levels abolished ERK phosphorylation and decreased NHE1 activity. These results demonstrate that B-Raf associates with and stimulates NHE1 activity and that B-Raf(V600E) also increases NHE1 activity that raises intracellular pH.

14665635|t|Familial Parkinson's disease-associated L166P mutation disrupts DJ-1 protein folding and function.
14665635|t|Mutations in DJ-1, a protein of unknown function, were recently identified as the cause for an autosomal recessive, early onset form of familial Parkinson's disease. Here we report that DJ-1 is a dimeric protein that exhibits protease activity but no chaperone activity. The protease activity was abolished by mutation of Cys-106 to Ala, suggesting that DJ-1 functions as a cysteine protease. Our studies revealed that the Parkinson's disease-linked L166P mutation impaired the intrinsic folding propensity of DJ-1 protein, resulting in a spontaneously unfolded structure that was incapable of forming a homodimer with itself or a heterodimer with wild-type DJ-1. Correlating with the disruption of DJ-1 structure, the L166P mutation abolished the catalytic function of DJ-1. Furthermore, as a result of protein misfolding, the L166P mutant DJ-1 was selectively polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Together these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism by which loss-of-function mutations in DJ-1 lead to Parkinson's disease.

9166661|t|Impact of natural IRS-1 mutations on insulin signals: mutations of IRS-1 in the PTB domain and near SH2 protein binding sites result in impaired function at different steps of IRS-1 signaling.
9166661|t|Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is one of the major substrates of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and mediates various insulin signals downstream. In this study, we have examined the impact of three natural IRS-1 mutations identified in NIDDM patients (G971R, P170R, and M209T) on insulin signaling. G971R is located near src homology 2 protein binding sites, and P170R and M209T are located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1. 32D-IR cells, stably overexpressing human insulin receptor, were transfected with wild-type human IRS-1 cDNA (WT) or three mutant IRS-1 cDNAs and analyzed. All the cell lines expressing mutant IRS-1 showed a significant reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with WT. Upon insulin stimulation, cells expressing G971R showed a 39% decrease (P < 0.005) in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity, a 43% decrease (P < 0.01) in binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a 22% decrease (P < 0.05) in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity compared with those expressing WT. Cells expressing P170R and M209T showed slight but significant decreases in PI 3-kinase activity (17 and 14%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in binding of p85 (22 and 16%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and a greater decrease in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (41 and 43%, respectively; both P < 0.005) compared with WT. After insulin stimulation, cells expressing P170R and M209T showed significant decreases in IRS-1 phosphorylation (37 and 42%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor (48 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.01) compared with WT. G971R showed no changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation and in IRS-1 binding to the insulin receptor compared with WT. These data suggest that the impaired mitogenic response of P170R and M209T was mainly due to reduced binding to the insulin receptor, whereas the impaired response of G971R was mainly due to reduced association with PI 3-kinase p85.

9087165|t|Expression of the activated p185erbB2 tyrosine kinase in human epithelial cells leads to MAP kinase activation but does not confer oncogenicity.
9087165|t|Amplification of the c-erbB2 gene and overexpression of p185erbB2 is found in approximately one-third of primary breast and ovarian cancers and also in some colon carcinomas. Moreover, a single point mutation in erbB2(V 664 E) confers transforming potential to erbB2 in NIH3T3 cells, even when expressed at low levels. To examine the transformation potential of erbB2 or erbB2(V-E) in colon epithelial cells, we have transfected a nontumorigenic clone of SW 613-S cells with either wild-type p185erbB2 or mutated p185erbB2(V-E). In contrast to p185erbB2, p185erbB2(V-E) associated constitutively with members of the Shc protein family, leading to phosphorylation of Shc and to stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). However, constitutive activation of MAP kinase activation in p185erbB2(V-E) expressing cells did not result in a tumorigenic phenotype. In addition, p185erbB2(V-E) expressing cells displayed a reduced ability to grow in soft agar compared to the parental cell line. In contrast these transfected cells were able to grow in three-dimensional collagen gels, whereas parental cells were not. Thus, expression of erbB2(V-E) in SW 613-S cells induced multiple changes in intracellular signaling and in growth requirement phenotype, particularly in response to the extracellular environment.

8605870|t|Cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by CPP32 during apoptosis.
8605870|t|Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is controlled by sterol-regulated proteolysis of membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). CPP32, a cysteine protease, was shown previously to cleave SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in vitro at an aspartic acid between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain and the first trans-membrane domain, liberating a transcriptionally active fragment. Here, we show that CPP32 exists in an inactive 32 kDa form in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. When apoptosis was induced with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, CPP32 was cleaved to subunits of 20 and 10 kDa to form the active protease. Under these conditions membrane-bound SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were both cleaved, and the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragments were found in nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained in human U937 cells induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-Fas and etoposide. The apoptosis-induced cleavage of SREBPs was not suppressed by sterols, indicating that apoptosis-induced cleavage and sterol-regulated cleavage are mediated by different proteases. CHO cells expressing a mutant SREBP-2 with an Asp--> Ala mutation at the CPP32 cleavage site showed sterol-regulated cleavage but no apoptosis-induced cleavage. These data are consistent with the emerging concept that CPP32 is a central mediator in apoptosis. They also indicate that SREBPs, like poly (ADP) ribose polymerase, are cleaved by CPP32 during programmed cell death.

20359967|t|Somatic mutation in the ACK1 ubiquitin association domain enhances oncogenic signaling through EGFR regulation in renal cancer derived cells.
20359967|t|Activated Cdc42-associated Kinase, ACK1, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with numerous interacting partners, including Cdc42 and EGFR. Gene amplification and overexpression of ACK1 were found in many cancer types such as those of the lung and prostate. Previously, we identified both somatic- and germ line missense mutations in the ACK1 coding sequence, by surveying 261 cancer cell lines and 15 control tissues. Here, we verified and characterized the non-synonymous mutation, ACK-S985 N, located in the ubiquitin association domain of the protein. Both overexpression and silencing experiments in MCF7 and A498 cells, respectively, demonstrated a role of the ACK1 S985 N mutation in enhancing cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Further, we showed that the ACK1 S985 N mutant is unable to bind ubiquitin, unlike the wild type kinase. This contributed to ACK1 protein stability and stabilized EGFR after EGF stimulation, thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling in cancer cells. In addition, the ACK1 S985 N-EGFR interaction is enhanced, but not the ubiquitination of the receptor. Intriguingly, silencing of ACK1 in A498 cells sensitized the renal carcinoma cells to gefitinib, against which they are otherwise resistant. The work demonstrates that other than gene amplification, a single somatic mutation in ACK1 can result in extended protein stability enabling the oncoprotein to exert its oncogenic function in tumor progression. It also provides a rationale to target ACK1 in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as EGFR inhibitors, to potentiate therapeutic action against resistant tumors.

11855836|t|Phosphorylation of Fanconi anemia protein, FANCA, is regulated by Akt kinase.
11855836|t|Phosphorylation of the Fanconi anemia complementation group A (FANCA) protein is thought to be important for the function of the FA pathway. However, the kinase for FANCA (so-called FANCA-PK) remains to be identified. FANCA has a consensus sequence for Akt kinase near serine 1149 (Ser1149), suggesting that Akt can phosphorylate FANCA. We performed in vitro kinase assays using as substrate either a GST-fusion wild-type (WT) FANCA fragment or a GST-fusion FANCA fragment containing a mutation from serine to alanine at 1149 (FANCA-S1149A). These experiments confirmed that FANCA is phosphorylated at Ser 1149, in vitro. However, (32)P-orthophosphate labeling experiments revealed that FANCA-S1149A was more efficiently phosphorylated than WT-FANCA. Furthermore, phosphorylation of wild-type FANCA was blocked by coexpression of a constitutively active (CA)-Akt and enhanced by a dominant-negative (DN) Akt. Our results suggest that Akt is a negative regulator of FANCA phosphorylation.

16793002|t|Phosphorylation of Thr654 but not Thr669 within the juxtamembrane domain of the EGF receptor inhibits calmodulin binding.
16793002|t|Calcium-calmodulin (CaM) binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to both inhibit and stimulate receptor activity. CaM binds to the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) domain (Met645-Phe688) of EGFR. Protein kinase C (PKC) mediated phosphorylation of Thr654 occurs within this domain. CaM binding to the JM domain inhibits PKC phosphorylation and conversely PKC mediated phosphorylation of Thr654 or Glu substitution of Thr654 inhibits CaM binding. A second threonine residue (Thr669) within the JM domain is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Previous results have shown that CaM interferes with EGFR-induced MAPK activation. If and how phosphorylation of Thr669 affects CaM-EGFR interaction is however not known. In the present study we have used surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) to study the influence of Thr669 phosphorylation on real time interactions between the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) domain of EGFR and CaM. The EGFR-JM was expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and phosphorylation was mimicked by generating Glu substitutions of either Thr654 or Thr669. Purified proteins were coupled to immobilized anti-GST antibodies at the sensor surface and increasing concentration of CaM was applied. When mutating Thr654 to Glu654 no specific CaM binding could be detected. However, neither single substitutions of Thr669 (Gly669 or Glu669) nor double mutants Gly654/Gly669 or Gly654/Glu669 influenced the binding of CaM to the EGFR-JM. This clearly shows that PKC may regulate EGF-mediated CaM signalling through phosphorylation of Thr654 whereas phosphorylation of Thr669 seems to play a CaM independent regulatory role. The role of both residues in the EGFR-calmodulin interaction was also studied in silico. Our modelling work supports a scenario where Thr654 from the JM domain interacts with Glu120 in the calmodulin molecule. Phosphorylation of Thr654 or Glu654 substitution creates a repulsive electrostatic force that would diminish CaM binding to the JM domain. These results are in line with the Biacore experiments showing a weak binding of the CaM to the JM domain with Thr654 mutated to Glu. Furthermore, these results provide a hypothesis to how CaM binding to EGFR might both positively and negatively interfere with EGFR-activity.

20145150|t|A placental growth factor variant unable to recognize vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 inhibits VEGF-dependent tumor angiogenesis via heterodimerization.
20145150|t|Angiogenesis is one of the crucial events for cancer development and growth. Two members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PlGF), which are able to heterodimerize if coexpressed in the same cell, are both required for pathologic angiogenesis. We have generated a PlGF1 variant, named PlGF1-DE in which the residues Asp72 and Glu73 were substituted with Ala, which is unable to bind and activate VEGF receptor-1 but is still able to heterodimerize with VEGF. Here, we show that overexpression in tumor cells by adenoviral delivery or stable transfection of PlGF1-DE variant significantly reduces the production of VEGF homodimer via heterodimerization, determining a strong inhibition of xenograft tumor growth and neoangiogenesis, as well as significant reduction of vessel lumen and stabilization, and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Conversely, the overexpression of PlGF1wt, also reducing the VEGF homodimer production comparably with PlGF1-DE variant through the generation of VEGF/PlGF heterodimer, does not inhibit tumor growth and vessel density compared with controls but induces increase of vessel lumen, vessel stabilization, and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. The property of PlGF and VEGF-A to generate heterodimer represents a successful strategy to inhibit VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. The PlGF1-DE variant, and not PlGF1wt as previously reported, acts as a "dominant negative" of VEGF and is a new candidate for antiangiogenic gene therapy in cancer treatment.

We have previously demonstrated that interaction of CaN B regulatory subunit with the CaN A catalytic subunit requires hydrophobic residues within the CaN A sequence 328-390 [Watanabe Y., Perrino, B.A., Chang, B.H., & Soderling, T.R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 456-460]. In the present study, selected hydrophobic residues within the B subunit were mutated to Glu to Gln. CaN B subunit mutants BE-1 (Val115/Leu116 to Glu), BE-2 (Val156/157/168/169 to Glu), and BQ-2 (Val156/157/168/169 to Gln) were expressed and purified. The three mutant B subunits bound 45Ca2+ normally. Mutants BE-2 and BQ-2 interacted with a GST fusion protein containing the B subunit binding domain of the CaN A subunit (residues 328-390), and they stimulated the phosphatase activity of the CaN A subunit in an in vitro reconstitution assay. Mutant BE-1 had a 3-fold reduced affinity for binding CaN A, and this mutant, even at saturating concentrations, gave very little stimulation of CaN A phosphatase activity. We conclude that residues Val115/Leu116 in the B subunit participate in high-affinity binding to the A subunit and are required for transducing the effects [i.e., decrease Km and increase Vmax; Perrino, B.A., Ng, L.Y., & Soderling, T.R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 340-346] of B subunit Ca2+ binding to stimulation of CaN A phosphatase activity.

15736952|t|Receptor-antagonist interactions in the complexes of agouti and agouti-related protein with human melanocortin 1 and 4 receptors.
15736952|t|The molecular interactions between human melanocortin receptor-1 and -4 (hMC1R and hMC4R) and their endogenous antagonists, agouti signaling protein (ASIP) and agouti-related protein (AGRP), were assessed by studying the effects of site-directed mutations on the binding affinity of (125)I-ASIP[90-132(L89Y)] and (125)I-AGRP(86-132). Mutations of homologous residues from transmembrane helices (TMHs) 3 and 6 and extracellular loop (EL) 3 (D121A, T124A, F257A, and F277M in hMC1R and D126A, I129A F261A, and M281F in hMC4R) impaired binding of both antagonists to hMC4R and binding of the ASIP fragment to hMC1R. However, the mutations in TMH2 (E94A in hMC1R and E100A in hMC4R), TMH7 (F280A in hMC1R and F284A in hMC4R), and EL2 (Y183S, H184S, and D184H in hMC1R) only significantly affected binding of the ASIP fragment. The dependence of agonist binding on the dithiothreitol concentration followed a monophasic curve for wild-type hMC4R and its C40A, C271A, and C279A mutants and a biphasic curve for hMC1R, suggesting the presence of at least one structurally and functionally essential disulfide bond in both wild-type receptors and the hMC4R mutants. Models of complexes of both receptors with the ASIP fragment and hMC4R with the AGRP fragment were calculated using constraints from the experimental structures of rhodopsin and AGRP fragments, a set of deduced hydrogen bonds, supplemented by two proposed disulfide bridges and receptor-ligand contacts, derived from our mutagenesis data. In the models of the ASIP fragment complexed with both receptors, the core ligand tripeptide, Arg-Phe-Phe, positioned between TMHs 3 and 6, is shifted toward TMHs 2 and 7 relative to its position in the AGRP-hMC4R model, while the N-terminal loop and two central disulfides of the antagonists interact with EL2 of the receptors.

16365045|t|The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3 and attenuates activity.
16365045|t|Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a widely expressed Ser/Thr protein kinase that phosphorylates numerous substrates. This large number of substrates requires precise and specific regulation of GSK3 activity, which is achieved by a combination of phosphorylation, localization, and interactions with GSK3-binding proteins. Members of the Wnt canonical pathway have been shown to influence GSK3 activity. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the Wnt canonical pathway co-receptor protein low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) as a GSK3-binding protein. The interaction between the C terminus of LRP6 and GSK3 was also confirmed by in vitro GST pull-down assays and in situ coimmunoprecipitation assays. In vitro assays using immunoprecipitated proteins demonstrated that the C terminus of LRP6 significantly attenuated the activity of GSK3beta. In situ, LRP6 significantly decreased GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation of tau at both primed and unprimed sites. Finally, it was also demonstrated that GSK3beta phosphorylates the PPP(S/T)P motifs in the C terminus of LRP6. This is the first identification of a direct interaction between LRP6 and GSK3, which results in an attenuation of GSK3 activity.

19228120|t|Identification of dimer interactions required for the catalytic activity of the TRPM7 alpha-kinase domain.
19228120|t|TRPM7 (transient receptor potential melastatin) combines an ion channel domain with a C-terminal protein kinase domain that belongs to the atypical alpha-kinase family. The TRPM7 alpha-kinase domain assembles into a dimer through the exchange of an N-terminal segment that extends from residue 1551 to residue 1577 [Yamaguchi, Matsushita, Nairn and Kuriyan (2001) Mol. Cell 7, 1047-1057]. Here, we show, by analysis of truncation mutants, that residues 1553-1562 of the N-terminus are essential for kinase activity but not dimer formation. Within this 'activation sequence', site-directed mutagenesis identified Tyr-1553 and Arg-1558 as residues critical for activity. Examination of the TRPM7 kinase domain structure suggests that the activation sequence interacts with the other subunit to help position a catalytic loop that contains the invariant Asp-1765 residue. Residues 1563-1570 of the N-terminal segment are critical for dimer assembly. Mutation of Leu-1564, Ile-1568 or Phe-1570 to alanine abolished both kinase activity and dimer formation. The activity of a monomeric TRPM7 kinase domain lacking the entire N-terminal segment was rescued by a GST (glutathione transferase) fusion protein containing residues 1548-1576 of TRPM7, showing that all interactions essential for activity are provided by the N-terminal segment. Activity was also restored by GST fused to the N-terminal segment of TRPM6 (residues 1711-1740), demonstrating the feasibility of forming functional TRPM6-TRPM7 alpha-kinase domain heterodimers. It is proposed that covalent modifications or binding interactions that alter the conformation of the N-terminal exchanged segment may provide a means to regulate TRPM7 kinase activity.

9725829|t|Identification of functional connections between calmodulin and the yeast actin cytoskeleton.
9725829|t|One of four intragenic complementing groups of temperature-sensitive yeast calmodulin mutations, cmd1A, results in a characteristic functional defect in actin organization. We report here that among the complementing mutations, a representative cmd1A mutation (cmd1-226: F92A) is synthetically lethal with a mutation in MYO2 that encodes a class V unconventional myosin with calmodulin-binding domains. Gel overlay assay shows that a mutant calmodulin with the F92A alteration has severely reduced binding affinity to a GST-Myo2p fusion protein. Random replacement and site-directed mutagenesis at position 92 of calmodulin indicate that hydrophobic and aromatic residues are allowed at this position, suggesting an importance of hydrophobic interaction between calmodulin and Myo2p. To analyze other components involved in actin organization through calmodulin, we isolated and characterized mutations that show synthetic lethal interaction with cmd1-226; these "cax" mutants fell into five complementation groups. Interestingly, all the mutations themselves affect actin organization. Unlike cax2, cax3, cax4, and cax5 mutations, cax1 shows allele-specific synthetic lethality with the cmd1A allele. CAX1 is identical to ANP1/GEM3/MCD2, which is involved in protein glycosylation. CAX4 is identical to the ORF YGR036c, and CAX5 is identical to MNN10/SLC2/BED1. We discuss possible roles for Cax proteins in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

22629372|t|Conserved Orb6 phosphorylation sites are essential for polarized cell growth in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
22629372|t|The Ndr-related Orb6 kinase is a key regulator of polarized cell growth in fission yeast, however the mechanism of Orb6 activation is unclear. Activation of other Ndr kinases involves both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by an upstream kinase. Previous reports suggest that the Nak1 kinase functions upstream from Orb6. Supporting this model, we show that HA-Orb6 overexpression partially restored cell polarity in nak1 ts cells. We also demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that Nak1 and Orb6 physically interact, and that the Nak1 C-terminal region is required for Nak1/Orb6 complex formation in vivo. However, results from in vitro kinase assays did not show phosphorylation of recombinant Orb6 by HA-Nak1, suggesting that Orb6 activation may not involve direct phosphorylation by Nak1. To investigate the role of Orb6 phosphorylation and activity, we substituted Ala at the ATP-binding and conserved phosphorylation sites. Overexpression of kinase-dead HA-Orb6(K122A) in wild-type cells resulted in a loss of cell polarity, suggesting that it has a dominant-negative effect, and it failed to rescue the polarity defect of nak1 or orb6 ts mutants. Recombinant GST-Orb6(S291A) did not autophosphorylate in vitro suggesting that Ser291 is the primary autophosphorylation site. HA-Orb6(S291A) overexpression only partially rescued the orb6 polarity defect and failed to rescue the nak1 defect, suggesting that autophosphorylation is important for Orb6 function. GST-Orb6(T456A) autophosphorylated in vitro, indicating that the conserved phosphorylation site at Thr456 is not essential for kinase activity. However, HA-Orb6(T456A) overexpression had similar effects as overexpressing kinase-dead HA-Orb6(K122A), suggesting that Thr456 is essential for Orb6 function in vivo. Also, we found that both phosphorylation site mutations impaired the ability of Myc-Nak1 to coimmunoprecipitate with HA-Orb6. Together, our results suggest a model whereby autophosphorylation of Ser291 and phosphorylation of Thr456 by an upstream kinase promote Nak1/Orb6 complex formation and Orb6 activation.

10944109|t|Dominant-negative activity of an alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor signal-inactivating point mutation.
10944109|t|alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-ARs) are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and activate inositol phosphate (IP) turnover. We show that glycine and asparagine mutations of Phe303 in transmembrane segment VI (TMVI) of the alpha(1B)-AR, a highly conserved residue in GPCRs, although increasing agonist affinity, abolish agonist-activated IP signalling. Co-expression of the Phe303 mutants also inhibited (-)epinephrine-stimulated IP signalling by wild-type alpha(1B)-AR and other G(q)-coupled receptors, as well as IP signalling mediated by AlF(4)(-) stimulation of both wild-type G(q alpha) and a constitutively active mutant. The inability of the Phe303 mutants to signal is due to induction of a receptor conformation that dissociates G-protein binding from activation. As a result, the Phe303 mutants sequester G(q alpha) and stoichiometrically inhibit Gq signalling in a dominant-negative manner. We further show that both the enhanced basal and agonist-stimulated IP-signalling activity of the constitutively active alpha(1B)-AR mutants, C128F and A293E, are inhibited in the double mutants, C128F/F303G and A293E/F303G. Phe303, therefore, appears to be critically involved in coupling TMVI alpha-helical movement, a key step in receptor activation, to activation of the cognate G-protein.

14996834|t|The hydrophobic recognition site formed by residues PsaA-Trp651 and PsaB-Trp627 of photosystem I in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confers distinct selectivity for binding of plastocyanin and cytochrome c6.
14996834|t|On the lumenal side of photosystem I (PSI), each of the two large core subunits, PsaA and PsaB, expose a conserved tryptophan residue to the surface. PsaB-Trp(627) is part of the hydrophobic recognition site that is essential for tight binding of the two electron donors plastocyanin and cytochrome c(6) to the donor side of PSI (Sommer, F., Drepper, F., and Hippler, M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6573-6581). To examine the function of PsaA-Trp(651) in binding and electron transfer of both donors to PSI, we generated the mutants PsaA-W651F and PsaA-W651S by site-directed mutagenesis and biolistic transformation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The protein-protein interaction and the electron transfer between the donors and PSI isolated from the mutants were analyzed by flash absorption spectroscopy. The mutation PsaA-W651F completely abolished the formation of a first order electron transfer complex between plastocyanin (pc) and the altered PSI and increased the dissociation constant for binding of cytochrome (cyt) c(6) by more than a factor of 10 as compared with wild type. Mutation of PsaA-Trp(651) to Ser had an even larger impact on the dissociation constant. The K(D) value increased another 2-fold when the values obtained for the interaction and electron transfer between cyt c(6) and PSI from PsaA-W651S and PsaA-W651F are compared. In contrast, binding and electron transfer of pc to PSI from PsaA-W651S improved as compared with PSI from PsaA-W651F and admitted the formation of an inter-molecular electron transfer complex, resulting in a K(D) value of about 554 microm that is still five times higher than observed for wild type. These results demonstrate that PsaA-Trp(651) is, such as PsaB-Trp(627), crucial for high affinity binding of pc and cyt c(6) to PSI. Our results also indicate that the highly conserved structural recognition motif that is formed by PsaA-Trp(651) and PsaB-Trp(627) confers a differential selectivity in binding of both donors to PSI.

26140185|t|TP53 Binding to BRCA1 and RAD51 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 Breast Cancer Cell Lines In vivo and In vitro.
26140185|t|BACKGROUND: Tumour suppressor genes such as TP53, BRCA1 and RAD51 are involved in DNA repair and their malfunctions result in genomic instability and cancer. Wild type (WT) TP53 binds to BRCA1and RAD51 in vivo and in vitro. However, mutated TP53 in tumours can interfere with WT TP53 function. We studied how mutation of TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line could affect its binding capacity and interfere with WT TP53 interaction with these DNA repair proteins. METHODS: Binding capacity of mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line to BRCA1 and RAD51 proteins in comparison to WT TP53 in MCF7 cell line was studied by Immunoprecipitation. In vitro studies were performed by GST-WT p53 pull-down assays in these cell lines to assess the interaction of GST-WT p53 with BRCA1 and RAD51 proteins. RESULTS: The results showed that mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cells interacted with BRCA1 protein in vivo and did not effect WT TP53 binding to this protein in vitro. The Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the mutated TP53 did not bind to RAD51 in comparison to WT TP53. However, this mutated protein could not interfere with binding of RAD51 to GST-WT p53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line by in vitro experiment. CONCLUSION: It was found that WT TP53 interactions with BRCA1 and RAD51 did not interfere with mutated TP53 in MDA-MB-468 cell line. In addition, RAD51 did not bind to TP53 with R273C mutation in vivo.

1645337|t|Identification of three amino acids in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain that are important for binding to the PDGF beta-receptor.
1645337|t|Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a disulfide-linked dimeric protein composed of two homologous polypeptide chains denoted A and B. Two types of PDGF receptors, alpha and beta, have been characterized. Whereas PDGF-AA binds only to PDGF alpha-receptors, PDGF-BB binds to both receptor types with high affinity. To map the regions of the PDGF B-chain that confer its ability to bind with high affinity to the PDGF beta-receptor, we expressed PDGF A/B-chain chimeras in COS cells and analyzed them with regard to PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor binding. A systematic analysis revealed that replacement of Asn-115, Arg-154, and Ile-158 of the PDGF B-chain with the corresponding A-chain amino acids led to a dramatic decrease in the affinity for the beta-receptor. Conversely, introduction of B-chain amino acids into the A-chain in the region spanning from Asn-115 to Ile-158 yielded a product with high affinity for the beta-receptor. These data thus indicate that Asn-115, Arg-154, and Ile-158 are likely to be part of the active site of the PDGF B-chain.

10891446|t|A Leu262Pro mutation in the integrin beta(3) subunit results in an alpha(IIb)-beta(3) complex that binds fibrin but not fibrinogen.
10891446|t|Platelet retraction of a fibrin clot is mediated by the platelet fibrinogen receptor, alpha(IIb)beta(3). In certain forms of the inherited platelet disorder, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) may interact normally with fibrin yet fail to support fibrinogen-dependent aggregation. We describe a patient (LD) with such a form of GT. Platelets from LD supported normal clot retraction but failed to bind fibrinogen. Platelet analysis using flow cytometry and immunoblotting showed reduced but clearly detectable alpha(IIb)beta(3), findings consistent with type II GT. Genotyping of LD revealed 2 novel beta(3) mutations: a deletion of nucleotides 867 to 868, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 267, and a T883C missense mutation, resulting in a leucine (Leu) 262-to-proline (Pro) substitution. Leu262 is highly conserved among beta integrin subunits and lies within an intrachain loop implicated in subunit association. Leu262Probeta(3) cotransfected with wild-type alpha(IIb) into COS-7 cells showed delayed intracellular maturation and reduced surface expression of easily dissociable complexes. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, Leu262Probeta(3) formed a complex with endogenous a(v) and retracted fibrin clots similarly to wild-type beta(3). The same cells, however, were unable to bind immobilized fibrinogen. The molecular requirements for alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with fibrin compared with fibrinogen, therefore, appear to differ. The region surrounding beta(3) Leu262 may maintain beta(3) in a fibrinogen-binding, competent form, but it appears not to be required for receptor interactions with fibrin.

19060929|t|The aurora kinase A regulates GSK-3beta in gastric cancer cells.
19060929|t|Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is located at 20q13, a region that is frequently amplified in gastric cancer. In this study, we have investigated the role of AURKA in regulating glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and beta-catenin/TCF complex in gastric cancer cells. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser 9 following the overexpression of AURKA in AGS cells. The immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for AURKA and GSK-3beta indicated that the two proteins coexist in the same protein complex. The recombinant human AURKA protein phosphorylated the GSK-3beta protein at Ser 9 in a concentration-dependent manner, in vitro. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) by GSK-3beta is known to target beta-catenin towards degradation. In line with our findings, the increase in phospho-GSK-3beta level was accompanied by a significant decrease in beta-catenin phosphorylation (Ser33/37/Thr41) and accumulation of beta-catenin protein. The knockdown of AURKA reversed the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and the beta-catenin protein levels. The immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated colocalization of AURKA and GSK-3beta proteins and a significant increase in the nuclear beta-catenin levels in cells overexpressing AURKA. The beta-catenin/TCF transcription activity was measured using the pTopFlash and its mutant pFopFlash luciferase reporter vectors. Indeed, AURKA overexpression led to a significant increase in the pTopFlash reporter activity, whereas kinase dead AURKA mutant (D274A) had no effect. Consistent with these findings, we detected a significant mRNA up-regulation of several direct targets of the beta-catenin/TCF transcription complex (cyclin D1, c-MYC, c-MYC-binding protein, CLDN1, FGF18 and vascular endothelial growth factor), and a two-fold increase in the proliferation rate in AURKA overexpressing cells. We conclude that the AURKA/GSK-3beta interaction is important in regulating beta-catenin, underscoring a novel oncogenic potential for AURKA in gastric tumorigenesis.

9639514|t|Naturally occurring mutations in glycoprotein Ibalpha that result in defective ligand binding and synthesis of a truncated protein.
9639514|t|The platelet GPIb-V-IX complex is the receptor for the initial binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) mediating platelet adhesion. The complex is composed of four membrane-spanning glycoproteins (GP): GPIbalpha, GPIbbeta, GPIX, and GPV. Bernard-Soulier syndrome results from a qualitative or quantitative defect in one or more components of the platelet membrane GPIb-V-IX complex. We describe the molecular basis of a novel Bernard-Soulier syndrome variant in two siblings in whom GPIbalpha was not detected on the platelet surface but that was present in a soluble form in plasma. DNA sequence analysis showed that the affected individuals were compound heterozygotes for two mutations. One, inherited from a maternal allele, a T777 --> C point mutation in GPIbalpha converting Cys65 --> Arg within the second leucine rich repeat, the other, a single nucleotide substitution (G2078 --> A) for the tryptophan codon (TGG) causing a nonsense codon (TGA) at residue 498 within the transmembrane region of GPIbalpha, inherited from a mutant paternal allele. The Bernard-Soulier phenotype was observed in siblings who were compound heterozygotes for these two mutations. Although GPIbalpha was not detected on the surface of the patient's platelets, soluble GPIbalpha could be immunoprecipitated from plasma. When plasmids encoding GPIbalpha containing the Cys65 --> Arg mutation were transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the GPbeta-IX complex (CHObetaIX), the expression of GPIbalpha was similar to the wild-type (WT) GPIbalpha, but did not bind vWF. When plasmids encoding GPIbalpha containing the Trp498 --> stop were transiently transfected into CHObetaIX, the surface expression of GPIbalpha was barely detectable compared with the WT GPIbalpha. Thus, this newly described compound heterozygous defect produces Bernard-Soulier syndrome by a combination of synthesis of a nonfunctional protein and of a truncated protein that fails to insert into the platelet membrane and is found circulating in plasma.

20479242|t|Role of CaMKIIdelta phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor in the force frequency relationship and heart failure.
20479242|t|The force frequency relationship (FFR), first described by Bowditch 139 years ago as the observation that myocardial contractility increases proportionally with increasing heart rate, is an important mediator of enhanced cardiac output during exercise. Individuals with heart failure have defective positive FFR that impairs their cardiac function in response to stress, and the degree of positive FFR deficiency correlates with heart failure progression. We have identified a mechanism for FFR involving heart rate dependent phosphorylation of the major cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR2), at Ser2814, by calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase-delta (CaMKIIdelta). Mice engineered with an RyR2-S2814A mutation have RyR2 channels that cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKIIdelta, and exhibit a blunted positive FFR. Ex vivo hearts from RyR2-S2814A mice also have blunted positive FFR, and cardiomyocytes isolated from the RyR2-S2814A mice exhibit impaired rate-dependent enhancement of cytosolic calcium levels and fractional shortening. The cardiac RyR2 macromolecular complexes isolated from murine and human failing hearts have reduced CaMKIIdelta levels. These data indicate that CaMKIIdelta phosphorylation of RyR2 plays an important role in mediating positive FFR in the heart, and that defective regulation of RyR2 by CaMKIIdelta-mediated phosphorylation is associated with the loss of positive FFR in failing hearts.

16679321|t|Essential role of the B23/NPM core domain in regulating ARF binding and B23 stability.
16679321|t|How cells coordinate inhibition of growth and division during genotoxic events is fundamental to our understanding of the origin of cancer. Despite increasing interest and extensive study, the mechanisms that link regulation of DNA synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis remain elusive. Recently, the tumor suppressor p14(ARF) (ARF) has been shown to interact functionally with the nucleolar protein B23/NPM (B23) and inhibit rRNA biogenesis. However, the molecular basis of the ARF-B23 interaction is hitherto unclear. Here we show that a highly conserved motif in the B23 oligomerization domain is essential for mediating ARF binding in vivo. Mutagenesis of conserved B23 core residues (L102A, G105A, G107A) prevented B23 from interacting with ARF. Modeling of the B23 core indicated that substitutions in the GSGP loop motif could trigger conformational changes in B23 thereby obstructing ARF binding. Interestingly, the GSGP loop mutants were unstable, defective for oligomerization, and delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. B23 core mutants displayed increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We conclude that the functional integrity of the B23 core motif is required for stability, efficient nucleolar localization as well as ARF binding.

12223469|t|EphB1 associates with Grb7 and regulates cell migration.
12223469|t|EphB1 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in diverse biological processes including nervous system development, angiogenesis, and neural synapsis formation and maturation. Grb7 is an adaptor molecule implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Here we report identification of an interaction between Grb7 and the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 by using Grb7 as a "bait" in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of Grb7 with the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 as well as the full-length receptor in intact cells. This interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb7 and requires tyrosine autophosphorylation of EphB1. Furthermore, Tyr-928 of EphB1 was identified as the primary binding site for Grb7. Stimulation of endogenous EphB1 in embryonal carcinoma P19 cells with its ligand ephrinB1 increased its association with Grb7, which is consistent with a role for the autophosphorylation of EphB1. We also found that EphB1 could phosphorylate Grb7 and mutation of either Tyr-928 or Tyr-594 to Phe decreased this activity. Finally, we show that EphB1 could stimulate fibroblast motility on extracellular matrix in a kinase-dependent manner, which also correlated with its association with Grb7. Consistent with this, co-expression of Grb7 with EphB1 further enhanced cell motility, whereas co-expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain abolished EphB1-stimulated cell migration. Together, our results identified a novel interaction between EphB1 with the adaptor molecule Grb7 and suggested that this interaction may play a role in the regulation of cell migration by EphB1.

16702950|t|EGFRvIII undergoes activation-dependent downregulation mediated by the Cbl proteins.
16702950|t|The overexpression or mutation of tyrosine kinases (TKs), such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), can lead to the development of cancer. The most common mutation of the EGFR in glioblastomas is the deletion of exons 2-7 known as the EGFRvIII. This mutant receptor cannot bind EGF but, instead, is constitutively active. The Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases (Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c) targets the activated EGFR for degradation. As the EGFRvIII is transforming, we investigated whether it could be downregulated by the Cbl proteins. The overexpression of all three Cbl proteins resulted in the ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFRvIII. As with the wild-type EGFR, the TK-binding domain and the RING finger of Cbl-b are sufficient for the downregulation of the EGFRvIII. Also, we found that Cbl-b is recruited to the EGFRvIII and inhibits the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the EGFRvIII. Mutation of the Cbl-binding site (Y1045F) in the EGFRvIII inhibits its ubiquitination and downregulation by Cbl-b and enhances its ability to transform. Furthermore, the EGFR TK inhibitor, AG 1478, prevents the downregulation of the EGFRvIII by the Cbl proteins and antagonizes the ability of an immunotoxin directed against the EGFRvIII to kill cells expressing this receptor. In conclusion, the EGFRvIII does not transform by escaping regulation by Cbl proteins and this activation-induced downregulation of the EGFRvIII has an important role in mediating the toxicity of anti-EGFRvIII immunotoxins.

16229872|t|Point mutations in the C-terminus of HIV-1 gp160 reduce apoptosis and calmodulin binding without affecting viral replication.
16229872|t|One hallmark of AIDS progression is a decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, though the mechanism is poorly defined. There is ample evidence that increased apoptosis is responsible for some, if not all, of the decline. Prior studies have shown that binding of cellular calmodulin to the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 increases sensitivity to fas-mediated apoptosis and that calmodulin antagonists can block this effect. We show that individual mutation of five residues in the C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain of Env is sufficient to significantly reduce fas-mediated apoptosis in transfected cells. The A835W mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 eliminated co-immunoprecipitation of Env with calmodulin in studies with stably transfected cells. Four point mutations (A835W, A838W, A838I, and I842R) and the corresponding region of HIV-1 HXB2 were cloned into the HIV-1 proviral vector pNL4-3 with no significant effect on viral production or envelope expression, although co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin and Env was decreased in three of these mutant viruses. Only wild-type envelope-containing virus induced significantly elevated levels of spontaneous apoptosis by day 5 post-infection. Fas-mediated apoptosis levels positively correlated with the degree of calmodulin co-immunoprecipitation, with the lowest apoptosis levels occurring in cells infected with the A835W envelope mutation. While spontaneous apoptosis appears to be at least partially calmodulin-independent, the effects of HIV-1 Env on fas-mediated apoptosis are directly related to calmodulin binding.

27588474|t|Direct interaction of Ikaros and Foxp1 modulates expression of the G protein-coupled receptor G2A in B-lymphocytes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
27588474|t|Ikaros and Foxp1 are transcription factors that play key roles in normal lymphopoiesis and lymphoid malignancies. We describe a novel physical and functional interaction between the proteins, which requires the central zinc finger domain of Ikaros. The Ikaros-Foxp1 interaction is abolished by deletion of this region, which corresponds to the IK6 isoform that is commonly associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also identify the Gpr132 gene, which encodes the orphan G protein-coupled receptor G2A, as a novel target for Foxp1. Increased expression of Foxp1 enhanced Gpr132 transcription and caused cell cycle changes, including G2 arrest. Co-expression of wild-type Ikaros, but not IK6, displaced Foxp1 binding from the Gpr132 gene, reversed the increase in Gpr132 expression and inhibited G2 arrest. Analysis of primary ALL samples revealed a significant increase in GPR132 expression in IKZF1-deleted BCR-ABL negative patients, suggesting that levels of wild-type Ikaros may influence the regulation of G2A in B-ALL. Our results reveal a novel effect of Ikaros haploinsufficiency on Foxp1 functioning, and identify G2A as a potential modulator of the cell cycle in Ikaros-deleted B-ALL.

15044319|t|Leukemia inhibitory factor activates cardiac L-Type Ca2+ channels via phosphorylation of serine 1829 in the rabbit Cav1.2 subunit.
15044319|t|We have previously reported that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gradually increased cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel current (I(CaL)), which peaked at 15 minutes in both adult and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and this increase was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. This study investigated the molecular basis of LIF-induced augmentation of I(CaL) in rodent cardiomyocytes. LIF induced phosphorylation of a serine residue in the alpha(1c) subunit (Ca(v)1.2) of L-type Ca2+ channels in cultured rat cardiomyocytes, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059. When constructs encoding either a wild-type or a carboxyl-terminal-truncated rabbit Ca(v)1.2 subunit were transfected into HEK293 cells, LIF induced phosphorylation of the resultant wild-type protein but not the mutant protein. Cotransfection of constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase also resulted in phosphorylation of the Ca(v)1.2 subunit in the absence of LIF stimulation. In in-gel kinase assays, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylated a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the carboxyl-terminal region of Ca(v)1.2 (residues 1700 through 1923), which contains the consensus sequence Pro-Leu-Ser-Pro. A point mutation within this consensus sequence, which results in a substitution of alanine for serine at residue 1829 (S1829A), was sufficient to abolish the LIF-induced phosphorylation. LIF increased I(CaL) in HEK cells transfected with wild-type Ca(v)1.2 but not with the mutated version. These results provide direct evidence that LIF phosphorylates the serine residue at position 1829 of the Ca(v)1.2 subunit via the actions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and that this phosphorylation increases I(CaL) in cardiomyocytes.

12023952|t|The presence of a single tyrosine residue at the carboxyl domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2/FLK-1 regulates its autophosphorylation and activation of signaling molecules.
12023952|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 plays a critical role in vasculogenesis during embryonic development and pathological angiogenesis, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing its functions. Here we investigated the role of tyrosine 1212 on mouse VEGFR-2 autophosphorylation and its signal transduction relay in endothelial cells. Mutation of tyrosine 1212 on VEGFR-2 to phenylalanine severely impaired the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and its ability to associate with and activate Src. This mutation also reduced the VEGFR-2 ability to phosphorylate phospholipase Cgamma1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Unlike mutation of tyrosine 1212 to phenylalanine, replacement of tyrosine 1212 with glutamic acid preserved the ligand-dependent activation of VEGFR-2 and activation of VEGFR-2-associated signaling proteins including Src, phospholipase Cgamma1, and MAPK. Further analysis showed that Src activation is not required for activation of VEGFR-2, since cells co-expressing wild type receptor with kinase dead Src or wild type Src displayed no apparent effect in the ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2. Similarly, expression of wild type VEGFR-2 in fibroblast (SYF) cells obtained from the triple knockout Src family kinases showed normal ligand-dependent autophosphorylation. Collectively, these results suggest that phosphorylation of tyrosine 1212 of VEGFR-2 plays a crucial role in the activation of VEGFR-2 and subsequently VEGFR-2-mediated angiogenesis.

11432831|t|A direct interaction between JNK1 and CrkII is critical for Rac1-induced JNK activation.
11432831|t|CrkII, a cellular homolog of v-crk, belongs to a family of adaptor proteins that play a central role in signal transduction cascades. We demonstrate that CrkII interacts directly with c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). A proline-rich sequence of JNK1 is critical for the interaction of the kinase with the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of CrkII. JNK1 is localized with CrkII in membrane ruffles of Crk-overexpressing cells in a Rac1-dependent manner. A JNK1 mutant (K340A) that fails to interact with CrkII is defective in Rac/epidermal growth factor-induced activation, but remains responsive to UVC irradiation. Furthermore, CrkII recruits JNK1 to a p130Cas multiprotein complex where it may be activated through a hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1- and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4-dependent pathway. Together, the results presented here argue for a new mechanism of regulation of the JNK pathway through the CrkII-p130Cas adaptor complex.

25652011|t|IQGAP1 regulates actin cytoskeleton organization in podocytes through interaction with nephrin.
25652011|t|Increasing data has shown that the cytoskeletal reorganization of podocytes is involved in the onset of proteinuria and the progression of glomerular disease. Nephrin behaves as a signal sensor of the slit diaphragm to transmit cytoskeletal signals to maintain the unique structure of podocytes. However, the nephrin signaling cascade deserves further study. IQGAP1 is a scaffolding protein with the ability to regulate cytoskeletal organization. It is hypothesized that IQGAP1 contributes to actin reorganization in podocytes through interaction with nephrin. IQGAP1 expression and IQGAP1-nephrin colocalization in glomeruli were progressively decreased and then gradually recovered in line with the development of foot process fusion and proteinuria in puromycin aminonucleoside-injected rats. In cultured human podocytes, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced disruption of F-actin and disorders of migration and spreading were aggravated by IQGAP1 siRNA, and these effects were partially restored by a wild-type IQGAP1 plasmid. Furthermore, the cytoskeletal disorganization stimulated by cytochalasin D in COS7 cells was recovered by cotransfection with wild-type IQGAP1 and nephrin plasmids but was not recovered either by single transfection of the wild-type IQGAP1 plasmid or by cotransfection of mutant IQGAP1 [△1443(S→A)] and wild-type nephrin plasmids. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using lysates of COS7 cells overexpressing nephrin and each derivative-domain molecule of IQGAP1 demonstrated that the poly-proline binding domain and RasGAP domain in the carboxyl terminus of IQGAP1 are the target modules that interact with nephrin. Collectively, these findings showed that activated IQGAP1, as an intracellular partner of nephrin, is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and functional regulation of podocytes.

11162638|t|Activated Fyn phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at tyrosine residue 125.
11162638|t|alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. To gain insight into the functions of alpha-synuclein, we sought protein kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in the central nervous system. In contrast to Lyn, PYK2, FAK, MAPK/ERK1, SAPK/JNK, and Cdk5, only Fyn could phosphorylate alpha-synuclein. In addition, A30P and A53T mutations did not affect the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein by Fyn. Mutation analysis revealed that activated Fyn phosphorylates specifically tyrosine residue 125 of alpha-synuclein. The distribution of alpha-synuclein and Fyn expression was similar in various parts of the brain and was colocalized in subcellular structures. Since Fyn regulates various signal transduction pathways in the central nervous system and plays an essential role in the neuronal cell differentiation, survival, and plasticity, results of this paper indicate that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein might be involved in one of the Fyn-mediated signaling pathways in neuronal cells.

10713702|t|Dimerization of the amino terminal domain of p57Kip2 inhibits cyclin D1-cdk4 kinase activity.
10713702|t|Previous studies have led to the proposal that a single molecule of Cki can associate with the cyclin/Cdk complex to repress its activity. On the other hand, multiple inhibitor molecules are required to inhibit Cdks. In the present work, by using differently tagged p57Kip2 proteins we demonstrate that p57Kip2 can bind to itself in vitro and in vivo. Mutational deletion analysis showed that the NH2 terminal domain of p57Kip2 is necessary and sufficient to dimerization. Using an in vitro competition/association assay, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 alone, Cdk4 alone and/or cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes do not compete for the p57Kip2 homodimers formation. However, a mutation in the alpha-helix domain of p57Kip2 (R33L) strongly reduced homodimer formation but did not modify interaction with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Also, increasing amounts of p57Kip2 lead in vivo to a significant augmentation in the level of p57Kip2 homodimerization associated with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes and to a marked inhibition of the cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase activity. Altogether, these data suggest a model whereby p57Kip2 associates with itself by using the NH2 domain to form a homodimeric species which interacts with and inhibits the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes.

9258433|t|Phosphorylation of Srp1p, the yeast nuclear localization signal receptor, in vitro and in vivo.
9258433|t|Srp1p, the protein encoded by SRP1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a yeast nuclear localization signal (NLS) receptor protein. We have previously reported isolation of a protein kinase from yeast extracts that phosphorylates Srp1p complexed with NLS peptides/proteins. From partial amino acid sequences of the four subunits of the purified kinase, we have now identified this protein kinase to be identical to yeast casein kinase II (CKII). It was previously thought that autophosphorylation of the 36 kDa subunit of the yeast enzyme was stimulated by the substrate, GST-Srp1p. However, with the use of a more refined system, no stimulation of autophosphorylation of the 36 kDa subunit of yeast CKII was observed. Biochemical and mutational analyses localized the in vitro phosphorylation site of Srp1p by CKII to serine 67. It was shown that, in the absence of NLS peptides/proteins, phosphorylation of the intact Srp1p protein is very weak, but deletion of the C-terminal end causes great stimulation of phosphorylation without NLS peptides/proteins. Thus, the CKII phosphorylation site is apparently masked in the intact protein structure by the presence of a C-terminal region, probably between amino acids 403 and 516. Binding of NLS peptides/proteins most likely causes a change in protein conformation, exposing the CKII phosphorylation site. Mutational alterations of serine 67, the CKII phosphorylation site, to valine (S67V) and aspartic acid (S67D) were not found to cause any significant deleterious effects on cell growth. Analysis of in vivo phosphorylation showed that at least 30% of the wild type Srp1p molecules are phosphorylated in growing cells, and that the phosphorylation is mostly at the serine 67 CKII site. The ability of Srp1p purified from E coli and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to bind a SV40 T-antigen NLS peptide was compared with that of Srp1p which was almost fully phosphorylated by CKII. No significant difference was observed. It appears that NLS binding does not require any phosphorylation of Srp1p, either by CKII or by some other protein kinase.

16439544|t|Transient and stable knockdown of the integrase cofactor LEDGF/p75 reveals its role in the replication cycle of human immunodeficiency virus.
16439544|t|After identifying the interaction between the transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN), we have now investigated the role of LEDGF/p75 during HIV replication. Transient small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of LEDGF/p75 in HeLaP4 cells resulted in a three- to fivefold inhibition of HIV-1 (strain NL4.3) replication. Quantitative PCR was used to pinpoint the replication block to the integration step. Next, polyclonal and monoclonal HeLaP4-derived cell lines were selected with a stable knockdown of LEDGF/p75 mediated by a lentiviral vector (lentivector) encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting this protein. Cell lines stably transduced with a lentivector encoding an unrelated hairpin or a double-mismatch hairpin served as controls. Again, a two- to fourfold reduction of HIV-1 replication was observed. The extent of LEDGF/p75 knockdown closely correlated with the reduction of HIV-1 replication. After the back-complementation of LEDGF/p75 in the poly- and monoclonal knockdown cell lines using an shRNA-resistant expression plasmid, viral replication was restored to nearly wild-type levels. The Q168A mutation in integrase has been shown to interfere with the interaction with LEDGF/p75 without reducing the enzymatic activity. Transduction by HIV-1-derived lentivectors carrying the Q168A IN mutant was severely hampered, pointing again to a requirement for LEDGF/p75. Altogether, our data validate LEDGF/p75 as an important cellular cofactor for HIV integration and as a potential target for antiviral drug development.

20230784|t|Phosphorylation by Nek1 regulates opening and closing of voltage dependent anion channel 1.
20230784|t|VDAC1 is a key component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. To initiate apoptosis and certain other forms of cell death, mitochondria become permeable such that cytochrome c and other pre-apoptotic molecules resident inside the mitochondria enter the cytosol and activate apoptotic cascades. We have shown recently that VDAC1 interacts directly with never-in-mitosis A related kinase 1 (Nek1), and that Nek1 phosphorylates VDAC1 on Ser193 to prevent excessive cell death after injury. How this phosphorylation regulates the activity of VDAC1, however, has not yet been reported. Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cytochrome c conductance studies to examine the configuration of VDAC1 before and after phosphorylation by Nek1. Wild-type VDAC1 assumes an open configuration, but closes and prevents cytochrome c efflux when phosphorylated by Nek1. A VDAC1-Ser193Ala mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by Nek1 under identical conditions, remains open and constitutively allows cytochrome c efflux. Conversely, a VDAC1-Ser193Glu mutant, which mimics constitutive phosphorylation by Nek1, remains closed by AFM and prevents cytochrome c leakage in the same liposome assays. Our data provide a mechanism to explain how Nek1 regulates cell death by affecting the opening and closing of VDAC1.

24163826|t|Calcium Integrin Binding Protein Associates with Integrins αVβ3 and αIIbβ3 Independent of β3 Activation Motifs.
24163826|t|The Calcium Integrin Binding protein (CIB) has been identified as interacting specifically with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin αIIb domain to induce receptor activation and integrin αIIbβ3 mediated cell adhesion to extracellular proteins. In K562 cells stably expressing mutated integrin αVβ3, or chimeric αVβ3 carrying αIIb cytoplasmic tail, we report that the interaction of CIB with β3 integrins is not αIIbβ3 specific but binds αIIb as well as αV cytoplasmic tail domains. A double mutation of two proline residues to alanine residues in the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, previously shown to disturb its conformation, inhibits chimeric αV/αIIbβ3-CIB interaction. This demonstrates that αIIb cytoplasmic domain loop-like conformation is required for interaction with CIB. Moreover, mutations of β3 cytoplasmic domain residues Tyr-747 and/or Tyr-759 to phenylalanine residues (Y747F, Y759F, and Y747,759F) as well as residues Ser-752 to proline or alanine (S752P and S752A), do not affect the αIIbβ3 or αVβ3 interaction with CIB. Since tyrosine residues Tyr-747 and/or Tyr-759 are the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of β3 subunit, these results suggest that the β3 integrin-CIB interaction occurs through a β3-phosphorylation independent mechanism. Likewise, ablation of conformation-dependent affinity change in β3 Ser752Pro mutation had no affect on CIB-β3 interaction. In summary, our results demonstrate that the αIIb-subunit integrin and CIB interaction is non-exclusive and requires the loop-like αIIb-cytoplasmic domain conformation. An interaction of CIB with αV-containing integrins provides an additional role for this molecule in keeping with its expression outside of platelets.

15064755|t|Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and other members of the TGF-beta superfamily regulate the development, maintenance and regeneration of tissues and organs. Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified. In this study, mutational and structural analyses show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface. The main chain atoms of Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant for other proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.

Beclin 1 is a central scaffold protein that assembles components for promoting or inhibiting autophagy. Association of Beclin 1 with its interacting proteins is regulated by the phosphorylation of Beclin 1 by various Ser/Thr kinases, but the Ser/Thr phosphatases that regulate these phosphorylation events remain unknown. Here we identify Ser-90 in Beclin 1 as a regulatory site whose phosphorylation is markedly enhanced in cells treated with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Beclin 1 Ser-90 phosphorylation is induced in skeletal muscle tissues isolated from starved mice. The Beclin 1 S90A mutant blocked starvation-induced autophagy. We found association of PP2A B55α with Beclin 1, which dissociate by starvation. We also found that death-associated protein kinase 3 directly phosphorylates Beclin 1 Ser-90. We propose that physiological regulation of Beclin 1 Ser-90 phosphorylation by PP2A and death-associated protein kinase 3 controls autophagy.

27566175|t|MST2 phosphorylation at serine 385 in mitosis inhibits its tumor suppressing activity.
27566175|t|Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) are core tumor suppressors in the Hippo signaling pathway. MST1/2 have been shown to regulate mitotic progression. Here, we report a novel mechanism for phospho-regulation of MST2 in mitosis and its biological significance in cancer. We found that the mitotic kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates MST2 in vitro and in vivo at serine 385 during antimitotic drug-induced G2/M phase arrest. This phosphorylation occurs transiently during unperturbed mitosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of MST2 does not affect its kinase activity or Hippo-YAP signaling. We further showed that mitotic phosphorylation-deficient mutant MST2-S385A possesses higher activity in suppressing cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Together, our findings reveal a novel layer of regulation for MST2 in mitosis and its role in tumorigenesis.

9677323|t|Loop III region of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain mediates binding to PDGF receptors and heparin.
9677323|t|Site-directed mutagenesis of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain was conducted to determine the importance of cationic amino acid residues (Arg160-Lys161-Lys162; RKK) located within the loop III region in mediating the biological and cell-association properties of the molecule. Binding to both PDGF alpha-and beta-receptors was inhibited by the conversion of all three cationic residues into anionic glutamates (RKK-->EEE), whereas an RKK-->SSS mutant also exhibited a modest loss in affinity for beta-receptors. Replacements with serine at either Arg160 (RKK-->SKK) or at all three positions (RKK-->SSS) had little effect on binding to alpha-receptors. Replacements with either glutamic or serine residues at any of the three positions also resulted in significant inhibition of heparin-binding activity. Furthermore, the RKK-->EEE mutant exhibited decreased association with the cell surface and accumulated in the culture medium as 29-32 kDa forms. Stable transfection of U87 astrocytoma cells with RKK-->EEE mutants of either the A-chain or the B-chain inhibited malignant growth in athymic nude mice. Despite altered receptor-binding activities, each of the loop III mutants retained full mitogenic activity when applied to cultured Swiss 3T3 cells. CD spectrophotometric analysis of the RKK-->EEE mutant revealed a secondary structure indistinguishable from the wild type, with a high degree of beta-sheet structure and random coil content (50% and 43% respectively). These findings indicate an important role of the Arg160-Lys161-Lys162 sequence in mediating the biological and cell-associative activities of the PDGF-BB homodimer, and reveal that the mitogenic activity of PDGF-BB is insufficient to mediate its full oncogenic properties.

16144832|t|Pias1 interaction and sumoylation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 8.
16144832|t|Group III presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a central role in regulating presynaptic activity through G-protein effects on ion channels and signal transducing enzymes. Like all Class C G-protein-coupled receptors, mGluR8 has an extended intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) presumed to allow for modulation of downstream signaling. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat brain cDNA library with the CTDs of mGluR8a and 8b (mGluR8-C) as baits, we identified sumo1 and four different components of the sumoylation cascade (ube2a, Pias1, Piasgamma, Piasxbeta) as interacting proteins. Binding assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins confirmed that Pias1 interacts not only with mGluR8-C but also with all group III mGluR CTDs. Pias1 binding to mGluR8-C required a region N-terminal to a consensus sumoylation motif and was not affected by arginine substitution of the conserved lysine 882 within this motif. Co-transfection of fluorescently tagged mGluR8a-C, sumo1, and enzymes of the sumoylation cascade into HEK293 cells showed that mGluR8a-C can be sumoylated in vivo. Arginine substitution of lysine 882 within the consensus sumoylation motif, but not other conserved lysines within the CTD, abolished in vivo sumoylation. Our results are consistent with post-translational sumoylation providing a novel mechanism of group III mGluR regulation.

10037723|t|The interaction of the human MutL homologues in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer.
10037723|t|Germline mutations in two human mismatch repair (MMR) genes, hMSH2 and hMLH1, appear to account for approximately 70% of the common cancer susceptibility syndrome hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Although the hMLH1 protein has been found to copurify with another MMR protein hPMS2 as a heterodimer, their function in MMR is unknown. In this study, we have identified the physical interaction regions of both hMLH1 with hPMS2. We then examined the effects of hMLH1 missense alterations found in HNPCC kindreds for their interaction with hPMS2. Four of these missense alterations (L574P, K616Delta, R659P, and A681T) displayed >95% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Two additional missense alterations (K618A and K618T) displayed a >85% reduction in binding to hPMS2, whereas three missense alterations (S44F, V506A, and E578G) displayed 25-65% reduction in binding to hPMS2. Interestingly, two HNPCC missense alterations (Q542L and L582V) contained within the consensus interaction region displayed no effect on interaction with hPMS2, suggesting that they may affect other functions of hMLH1. These data confirm that functional deficiencies in the interaction of hMLH1 with hPMS2 are associated with HNPCC as well as suggest that other unknown functional alteration of the human MutL homologues may lead to tumorigenesis in HNPCC kindreds.

23798621|t|Acetylation of the cell-fate factor dachshund determines p53 binding and signaling modules in breast cancer.
23798621|t|Breast cancer is a leading form of cancer in the world. The Drosophila Dac gene was cloned as an inhibitor of the hyperactive epidermal growth factor (EGFR), ellipse. Herein, endogenous DACH1 co-localized with p53 in a nuclear, extranucleolar compartment and bound to p53 in human breast cancer cell lines, p53 and DACH1 bound common genes in Chip-Seq. Full inhibition of breast cancer contact-independent growth by DACH1 required p53. The p53 breast cancer mutants R248Q and R273H, evaded DACH1 binding. DACH1 phosphorylation at serine residue (S439) inhibited p53 binding and phosphorylation at p53 amino-terminal sites (S15, S20) enhanced DACH1 binding. DACH1 binding to p53 was inhibited by NAD-dependent deacetylation via DACH1 K628. DACH1 repressed p21CIP1 and induced RAD51, an association found in basal breast cancer. DACH1 inhibits breast cancer cellular growth in an NAD and p53-dependent manner through direct protein-protein association.

24332715|t|Structural details of human tuba recruitment by InlC of Listeria monocytogenes elucidate bacterial cell-cell spreading.
24332715|t|The human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to directly spread to neighboring cells of host tissues, a process recently linked to the virulence factor InlC. InlC targets the sixth SH3 domain (SH3-6) of human Tuba, disrupting its physiological interaction with the cytoskeletal protein N-WASP. The resulting loss of cortical actin tension may slacken the junctional membrane, allowing protrusion formation by motile Listeria. Complexes of Tuba SH3-6 with physiological partners N-WASP and Mena reveal equivalent binding modes but distinct affinities. The interaction surface of the infection complex InlC/Tuba SH3-6 is centered on phenylalanine 146 of InlC stacking upon asparagine 1569 of Tuba. Replacing Phe146 by alanine largely abrogates molecular affinity and in vivo mimics deletion of inlC. Collectively, our findings indicate that InlC hijacks Tuba through its LRR domain, blocking the peptide binding groove to prevent recruitment of its physiological partners.

9228058|t|Characterization of Fas (Apo-1, CD95)-Fas ligand interaction.
9228058|t|The death-inducing receptor Fas is activated when cross-linked by the type II membrane protein Fas ligand (FasL). When human soluble FasL (sFasL, containing the extracellular portion) was expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, the three N-linked glycans of each FasL monomer were found to be essential for efficient secretion. Based on the structure of the closely related lymphotoxin alpha-tumor necrosis factor receptor I complex, a molecular model of the FasL homotrimer bound to three Fas molecules was generated using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Point mutations of amino acid residues predicted to affect the receptor-ligand interaction were introduced at three sites. The F275L mutant, mimicking the loss of function murine gld mutation, exhibited a high propensity for aggregation and was unable to bind to Fas. Mutants P206R, P206D, and P206F displayed reduced cytotoxicity toward Fas-positive cells with a concomitant decrease in the binding affinity for the recombinant Fas-immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins. Although the cytotoxic activity of mutant Y218D was unaltered, mutant Y218R was inactive, correlating with the prediction that Tyr-218 of FasL interacts with a cluster of three basic amino acid side chains of Fas. Interestingly, mutant Y218F could induce apoptosis in murine, but not human cells.

23770285|t|Sef (similar expression to fgf genes, also named IL-17RD) was identified as a negative regulator of fibroblast growth factor signaling. Sef-S, an alternative splice isoform of Sef, inhibits FGF-induced NIH3T3 cell proliferation. Here we report that Sef-S physically interacts with TAK1, induces Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination on lysine 209 and TAK1-mediated JNK and p38 activation. Co-overexpression of TAK1 WT, K34R, K150R, K158R mutants with Sef-S induces Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination whereas TAK1 K63R and K209R mutants fail. Furthermore, co-overexpression of Sef-S and TAK1 induce 293T cells apoptosis. These results reveal Sef-S actives Lys63-linked TAK1 polyubiquitination on lysine 209, induces TAK1-mediated JNK and p38 activation and also results apoptosis in 293T cells.

12808025|t|Pex15p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a molecular basis for recruitment of the AAA peroxin Pex6p to peroxisomal membranes.
12808025|t|The gene products (peroxins) of at least 29 PEX genes are known to be necessary for peroxisome biogenesis but for most of them their precise function remains to be established. Here we show that Pex15p, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein, in vivo and in vitro binds the AAA peroxin Pex6p. This interaction functionally interconnects these two hitherto unrelated peroxins. Pex15p provides the mechanistic basis for the reversible targeting of Pex6p to peroxisomal membranes. We could demonstrate that the N-terminal part of Pex6p contains the binding site for Pex15p and that the two AAA cassettes D1 and D2 of Pex6p have opposite effects on this interaction. A point mutation in the Walker A motif of D1 (K489A) decreased the binding of Pex6p to Pex15p indicating that the interaction of Pex6p with Pex15p required binding of ATP. Mutations in Walker A (K778A) and B (D831Q) motifs of D2 abolished growth on oleate and led to a considerable larger fraction of peroxisome bound Pex6p. The nature of these mutations suggested that ATP-hydrolysis is required to disconnect Pex6p from Pex15p. On the basis of these results, we propose that Pex6p exerts at least part of its function by an ATP-dependent cycle of recruitment and release to and from Pex15p.

10644696|t|Specificity determinants of substrate recognition by the protein kinase DYRK1A.
10644696|t|DYRK1A is a dual-specificity protein kinase that is thought to be involved in brain development. We identified a single phosphorylated amino acid residue in the DYRK substrate histone H3 (threonine 45) by mass spectrometry, phosphoamino acid analysis, and protein sequencing. Exchange of threonine 45 for alanine abolished phosphorylation of histone H3 by DYRK1A and by the related kinases DYRK1B, DYRK2, and DYRK3 but not by CLK3. In order to define the consensus sequence for the substrate specificity of DYRK1A, a library of 300 peptides was designed in variation of the H3 phosphorylation site. Evaluation of the phosphate incorporation into these peptides identified DYRK1A as a proline-directed kinase with a phosphorylation consensus sequence (RPX(S/T)P) similar to that of ERK2 (PX(S/T)P). A peptide designed after the optimal substrate sequence (DYRKtide) was efficiently phosphorylated by DYRK1A (K(m) = 35 microM) but not by ERK2. Both ERK2 and DYRK1A phosphorylated myelin basic protein, whereas only ERK2, but not DYRK1A, phosphorylated the mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate ELK-1. This marked difference in substrate specificity between DYRK1A and ERK2 can be explained by the requirement for an arginine at the P -3 site of DYRK substrates and its presumed interaction with aspartate 247 conserved in all DYRKs.

9380408|t|Identification of a second Grb2 binding site in the v-Fms tyrosine kinase.
9380408|t|Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the v-Fms oncogene product results in the formation of high-affinity binding sites for cellular proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. These proteins transduce various mitogenic and morphogenic signals. As reported previously, Y696KNI in the kinase insert domain of v-Fms binds to the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), a stimulator of the Ras/Raf1 pathway. Here, we mapped Y921TNL within the C-terminal domain of Fms as a novel autophosphorylation site. We demonstrate that this site constitutes a second Grb2 binding site: a recombinant fusion protein (residues 904-944) containing phosphorylated Y921 bound Grb2 from FDCP-1Mac11 cell extracts significantly more efficiently than a corresponding protein (residues 617-759) containing Y696. A yeast two-hybrid system which allowed the formation of a functional Fms tyrosine kinase was employed to quantify binding of Grb2. Fms-protein containing either one of the two phosphorylation sites bound Grb2 equally well, binding was increased for proteins carrying both sites. In contrast, the simultaneous substitution of Y696 and Y921 by phenylalanines abolished Grb2 binding. Mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing the Y921F mutant Fms-protein showed a substantially higher content of fibronectin network than wild-type transformed cells and had largely lost their serum independent growth phenotype.

24055812|t|p85-RhoGDI2, a novel complex, is required for PSGL-1-induced β1 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to VCAM-1.
24055812|t|P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and β1 integrin play essential roles in T cell trafficking during inflammation. E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 are their ligands expressed on inflammation-activated endothelium. During the tethering and rolling of lymphocytes on endothelium, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 binds E-selectin and induces signals. Subsequently, β1 integrin is activated and mediates stable adhesion. However, the intracellular signal pathways from PSGL-1 to β1 integrin have not yet been fully understood. Here, we find that p85, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, forms a novel complex with Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2, a lymphocyte-specific RhoGTPases dissociation inhibitor. Phosporylations of the p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues by c-Abl and Src were required for the complex to be recruited to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and thereby regulate β1 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Both shRNAs to Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 and p85 and over-expression of Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 Y130F and Y153F significantly reduced the above-mentioned adhesion. Although Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 in the p85-Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 complex was also phosphorylated on 24 tyrosine residue by Syk, the phosphorylation is not required for the adhesion. Taken together, we find that specific phosphorylations on 130 and 153 tyrosine residues of p85-bound Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor-2 are pivotal for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1-induced β1 integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. This will shed new light on the mechanisms that connect leukocyte initial rolling with subsequent adhesion.

2288878|t|A single Cys706 to Phe substitution in the retinoblastoma protein causes the loss of binding to SV40 T antigen.
2288878|t|Most naturally occurring mutants of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein contain large deletions or truncations. The small cell lung carcinoma cell line H209 contains a normal-sized but unphosphorylated RB protein (Hensel et al., Cancer Res., 50: 3067-3072, 1990), which fails to form a complex with SV40 T antigen, suggesting that the RB gene of H209 may contain a subtle mutation. To define this mutation, the RB complementary DNA and genomic DNA were sequenced, revealing a point mutation in exon 21 that changed a G to a T. This results in an amino acid substitution of a Phe for Cys706. The mutant RB complementary DNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription and translation to synthesize the mutated protein. The resulting protein failed to bind to SV40 T antigen, demonstrating that a single missense mutation of the RB gene led to the complete inactivation of the ability of the RB protein to bind T antigen.

11683636|t|Structural and functional mapping of the thrombin domain involved in the binding to the platelet glycoprotein Ib.
11683636|t|The activation of human platelets by alpha-thrombin is mediated in part by cleavage of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and 4 and by the glycoprotein (Ib)alpha, (Gp(Ib)alpha), which binds with high affinity to alpha-thrombin. Recent studies have shown that the thrombin domain referred to as heparin binding site (HBS) is involved in the interaction with the platelet Gp(Ib)alpha. The HBS is rich in basic amino acids. To identify the key amino acid residues involved in the binding to Gp(Ib)alpha, we have performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of the basic HBS R93, R97, R101, R233, K236, K240, R233/K236/Q239, as well as of the neutral Q239 residues, located in different regions of the domain. For comparison, mutation at R67 within the fibrinogen recognition site (FRS) of thrombin was performed as well. Solid-phase binding experiments showed that the Kd of thrombin-GpIb interaction was reduced 22-fold for R93A, 8-fold for R97A, 13-fold for R101A, 29-fold for R233A, 21-fold for K236A, 5-fold for K240A, and 31-fold for the triple mutant R233A/K236A/Q239A, while the Q239A and R67A forms did not show any significant affinity change. The platelet activating capacity of these mutants was evaluated as well. Using gel-filtered platelets, the EC50 value of thrombin-induced aggregation was from 5- to 13-fold higher in the HBS mutants than in the WT form, and was linearly and positively correlated with the corresponding Kd values pertaining to thrombin binding to GpIb. Measurements of PAR-1 hydrolysis on the platelet membrane showed that the HBS mutants R233A, R101A, R93A, K236A, and R233/K236/Q239 forms had a reduction of the apparent kcat/Km value. These results are a consequence of a defective binding to GpIb, which is known to optimize the interaction with PAR-1 in situ. A confirm of this hypothesis came from the demonstration that the kcat/Km value pertaining to the hydrolysis by the HBS-mutated thrombins of the synthetic PAR-1 38-60 peptide in solution was similar to that one obtained with the WT form. In conclusion, these experiments provide a structural and functional mapping of the thrombin HBS subregions involved in the binding to the platelet Gp(Ib)alpha and in the cell activation.

19874472|t|Functional association of phosphoinositide-3-kinase with platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha, the major ligand-binding subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex.
19874472|t|BACKGROUND: The adhesion receptor glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V, which binds von Willebrand factor (VWF) and other ligands, initiates platelet activation and thrombus formation at arterial shear rates, and may control other vascular processes, such as coagulation, inflammation, and platelet-mediated tumor metastasis. The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the ligand-binding GPIbalpha subunit contains binding sites for filamin (residues 561-572, critically Phe568/Trp570), 14-3-3zeta (involving phosphorylation sites Ser587/590 and Ser609), and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) regulatory subunit, p85. OBJECTIVES: We previously showed that, as compared with wild-type receptor, deleting the contiguous sequence 580-590 or 591-610, but not upstream sequences, of GPIbalpha expressed as a GPIb-IX complex in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibited VWF-dependent Akt phosphorylation, which is used as a read-out for PI3-kinase activity. Pulldown experiments using glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-p85 or GST-14-3-3zeta constructs, and competitive inhibitors of 14-3-3zeta binding, suggested an independent association of 14-3-3zeta and PI3-kinase with GPIbalpha. The objective of this study was to analyze a further panel of GPIbalpha deletion mutations within residues 580-610. RESULTS: We identified a novel deletion mutant, Delta591-595, that uniquely disrupts 14-3-3zeta binding but retains the functional p85/PI3-kinase association. Deletion of other sequences within the 580-610 region were less discriminatory, and either partially affected p85/PI3-kinase and 14-3-3zeta binding (Delta580-585, Delta586-590, Delta596-600, Delta601-605), or strongly inhibited binding of both proteins (Delta606-610). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings have significant implications for interpreting the functional role of p85 and/or 14-3-3zeta in GPIb-dependent signaling or platelet functional studies involving truncation of the C-terminal residues in cell-based assays and mouse models. The Delta591-595 mutation provides another strategy for determining the function of GPIbalpha-associated 14-3-3zeta by selective disruption of 14-3-3zeta but not p85/PI3-kinase binding.

15053879|t|Phosphorylation on Thr-55 by TAF1 mediates degradation of p53: a role for TAF1 in cell G1 progression.
15053879|t|The largest subunit of TFIID, TAF1, possesses an intrinsic protein kinase activity and is important for cell G1 progression and apoptosis. Since p53 functions by inducing cell G1 arrest and apoptosis, we investigated the link between TAF1 and p53. We found that TAF1 induces G1 progression in a p53-dependent manner. TAF1 interacts with and phosphorylates p53 at Thr-55 in vivo. Substitution of Thr-55 with an alanine residue (T55A) stabilizes p53 and impairs the ability of TAF1 to induce G1 progression. Furthermore, both RNAi-mediated TAF1 ablation and apigenin-mediated inhibition of the kinase activity of TAF1 markedly reduced Thr-55 phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation and the resultant degradation of p53 provide a mechanism for regulation of the cell cycle by TAF1. Significantly, the Thr-55 phosphorylation was reduced following DNA damage, suggesting that this phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization of p53 in response to DNA damage.

12050230|t|A novel, C-terminal dominant negative mutation of the GR causes familial glucocorticoid resistance through abnormal interactions with p160 steroid receptor coactivators.
12050230|t|Primary cortisol resistance is a rare, inherited or sporadic form of generalized end-organ insensitivity to glucocorticoids. Here, we report a kindred in which affected members had a heterozygous T to G base substitution at nucleotide 2373 of exon 9alpha of the GR gene, causing substitution of Ile by Met at position 747. This mutation was located close to helix 12, at the C terminus of the ligand-binding domain, which has a pivotal role in the formation of activation function (AF)-2, a subdomain that interacts with p160 coactivators. The affinity of the mutant GR for dexamethasone was decreased by about 2-fold, and its transcriptional activity on the glucocorticoid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus promoter was compromised by 20- to 30-fold. In addition, the mutant GR functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type receptor-induced transactivation. The mutant GR through its intact AF-1 domain bound to a p160 coactivator, but failed to do so through its AF-2 domain. Overexpression of a p160 coactivator restored the transcriptional activity and reversed the negative transdominant activity of the mutant GR. Interestingly, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused GRalphaI747M had a slight delay in its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and formed coarser nuclear speckles than GFP-fused wild-type GRalpha. Similarly, a GFP-fused p160 coactivator had a distinctly different distribution in the nucleus in the presence of mutant vs. wild-type receptor, presenting also as coarser speckling. We conclude that the mutation at amino acid 747 of the GR causes familial, autosomal dominant glucocorticoid resistance by decreasing ligand binding affinity and transcriptional activity, and by exerting a negative transdominant effect on the wild-type receptor. The mutant receptor has an ineffective AF-2 domain, which leads to an abnormal interaction with p160 coactivators and a distinct nuclear distribution of both.

9832503|t|Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta regulates cyclin D1 proteolysis and subcellular localization.
9832503|t|The activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases serve to integrate extracellular signaling during G1 phase with the cell-cycle engine that regulates DNA replication and mitosis. Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3beta can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3beta is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3beta remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3beta in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3beta.

16338176|t|Truncation of the C-terminus of human MLH1 blocks intracellular stabilization of PMS2 and disrupts DNA mismatch repair.
16338176|t|The human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein MLH1 has essential roles in the correction of replication errors and the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and cytotoxic responses to DNA damage that contribute to suppression of cancer risk. MLH1 functions as a heterodimer with the PMS2 protein, and steady state levels of PMS2 are very low in MLH1-deficient cells. Unique to MLH1 among MutL-homolog proteins, and conserved in identified eukaryotic MLH1 proteins, is the so-called C-terminal homology domain (CTH). The function of these C-terminal 20-30 amino acids is not known. We investigated the effect of a C-terminal truncation of human MLH1 (MLH1-L749X) on mammalian MMR by testing its activity in MLH1-deficient cells. We found the CTH to be essential for suppression of spontaneous mutation, activation of a cytotoxic response to 6-thioguanine, and maintenance of normal steady state levels of PMS2. Co-expression in doubly mutant Mlh1-/-; Pms2-/- fibroblasts showed that MLH1-L749X was unable to stabilize PMS2. Over-expression of MLH1-L749X did not reduce stabilization of PMS2 mediated by wild-type MLH1, indicating that truncation of the CTH reduces the ability to compete with wild-type MLH1 for interaction with PMS2. Lack of PMS2 stabilization also was observed with a previously reported pathogenic truncation (MLH1-Y750X), but not with two different point mutations in the CTH. Biochemical assays demonstrated that truncation of the CTH reduced the stability of heterodimers, although MLH1-L749X retained significant capacity for interaction with PMS2. Thus, the CTH of human MLH1 is necessary for error correction, checkpoint signaling, and for promoting interaction with, and the stability of, PMS2. Analysis of the CTH role in stabilizing PMS2 was facilitated by a novel intracellular assay for MLH1-PMS2 interaction. This assay should prove useful for identifying additional amino acids in MLH1 and PMS2 necessary for interaction in cells, and for determining the functional consequences of MLH1 mutations identified in human cancers.

15695813|t|IQGAP1 promotes neurite outgrowth in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.
15695813|t|In eukaryotic cells IQGAP1 binds to and alters the function of several proteins, including actin, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, Cdc42, and Rac1. Yeast IQGAP1 homologues have an important role in cytoskeletal organization, suggesting that modulation of the cytoskeleton is a fundamental role of IQGAP1. Phosphorylation is a common mechanism by which cells regulate protein function. Here we demonstrate that endogenous IQGAP1 is highly phosphorylated in MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, incubation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated phosphate incorporation into IQGAP1. By using mass spectrometry, Ser-1443 was identified as the major site phosphorylated on IQGAP1 in intact cells treated with PMA. Ser-1441 was also phosphorylated but to a lesser extent. In vitro analysis with purified proteins documented that IQGAP1 is a substrate for protein kinase Cepsilon, which catalyzes phosphorylation on Ser-1443. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of cellular protein kinase C via bisindolymaleimide abrogated Ser-1443 phosphorylation in response to PMA. To elucidate the biological sequelae of phosphorylation, Ser-1441 and Ser-1443 were converted either to alanine, to create a nonphosphorylatable construct, or to glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively, to generate a phosphomimetic IQGAP1. Although overexpression of wild type IQGAP1 promoted neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, the nonphosphorylatable IQGAP1 S1441A/S1443A had no effect. In contrast, the S1441E/S1443D mutation markedly enhanced the ability of IQGAP1 to induce neurite outgrowth. Our data disclose that IQGAP1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in intact cells and that phosphorylation of IQGAP1 will alter its ability to regulate the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells.

16371368|t|Effects of a leukemia-associated gain-of-function mutation of SHP-2 phosphatase on interleukin-3 signaling.
16371368|t|Mutations in SHP-2 phosphatase that cause hyperactivation of its catalytic activity have been identified in human leukemias, particularly juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which is characterized by hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitor cells to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 induce hematopoietic malignancies are not fully understood. Our previous studies have shown that SHP-2 plays an essential role in IL-3 signal transduction in both catalytic-dependent and -independent manners and that overexpression (5-6-fold) of wild type (WT) SHP-2 attenuates IL-3-mediated hematopoietic cell function through accelerated dephosphorylation of STAT5. These results raised the possibility that SHP-2-associated leukemias are not solely attributed to the increased catalytic activity of GOF mutant SHP-2. GOF mutant SHP-2 must have gained additional capacities. To test this possibility, we investigated effects of a GOF mutation of SHP-2 (SHP-2 E76K) on hematopoietic cell function and IL-3 signal transduction by comparing with those of overexpressed WT SHP-2. Our results showed that SHP-2 E76K mutation caused myeloproliferative disease in mice, while overexpression of WT SHP-2 decreased hematopoietic potential of the transduced cells in recipient animals. The E76K mutation in the N-terminal Src homology 2 domain increased interactions of mutant SHP-2 with Grb2, Gab2, and p85, leading to hyperactivation of IL-3-induced Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. In addition, despite the substantial increase in the catalytic activity, dephosphorylation of STAT5 by SHP-2 E76K was dampened. Furthermore, catalytically inactive SHP-2 E76K with an additional C459S mutation retained the capability to increase the interaction with Gab2 and to enhance the activation of the PI3K pathway. Taken together, these studies suggest that in addition to the elevated catalytic activity, fundamental changes in physical and functional interactions between GOF mutant SHP-2 and signaling partners also play an important role in SHP-2-related leukemigenesis.

15134463|t|In vitro phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 by protein kinase C-zeta: functional analysis and identification of novel phosphorylation sites.
15134463|t|Protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) participates both in downstream insulin signaling and in the negative feedback control of insulin action. Here we used an in vitro approach to identify PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites within insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and to characterize the functional implications. A recombinant IRS-1 fragment (rIRS-1(449)(-)(664)) containing major tyrosine motifs for interaction with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase strongly associated to the p85alpha subunit of PI 3-kinase after Tyr phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Phosphorylation of rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) by PKC-zeta induced a prominent inhibition of this process with a mixture of classical PKC isoforms being less effective. Both PKC-zeta and the classical isoforms phosphorylated rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) on Ser(612). However, modification of this residue did not reduce the affinity of p85alpha binding to pTyr-containing peptides (amino acids 605-615 of rat IRS-1), as determined by surface plasmon resonance. rIRS-1(449)(-)(664) was then phosphorylated by PKC-zeta using [(32)P]ATP and subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping based on two-dimensional HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. Ser(498) and Ser(570) were identified as novel phosphoserine sites targeted by PKC-zeta. Both sites were additionally confirmed by phosphopeptide mapping of the corresponding Ser --> Ala mutants of rIRS-1(449)(-)(664). Ser(570) was specifically targeted by PKC-zeta, as shown by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antiserum against Ser(570) of IRS-1. Binding of p85alpha to the S570A mutant was less susceptible to inhibition by PKC-zeta, when compared to the S612A mutant. In conclusion, our in vitro data demonstrate a strong inhibitory action of PKC-zeta at the level of IRS-1/PI 3-kinase interaction involving multiple serine phosphorylation sites. Whereas Ser(612) appears not to participate in the negative control of insulin signaling, Ser(570) may at least partly contribute to this process.

19917604|t|Self-association of calcium-binding protein S100A4 and metastasis.
19917604|t|Elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 promote metastasis and in carcinoma cells are associated with reduced survival of cancer patients. S100A4 interacts with target proteins that affect a number of activities associated with metastatic cells. However, it is not known how many of these interactions are required for S100A4-promoted metastasis, thus hampering the design of specific inhibitors of S100A4-induced metastasis. Intracellular S100A4 exists as a homodimer through previously identified, well conserved, predominantly hydrophobic key contacts between the subunits. Here it is shown that mutating just one key residue, phenylalanine 72, to alanine is sufficient to reduce the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to 50% that of the wild type protein, and just 2 or 3 specific mutations reduces the metastasis-promoting activity of S100A4 to less than 20% that of the wild type protein. These mutations inhibit the self-association of S100A4 in vivo and reduce markedly the affinity of S100A4 for at least two of its protein targets, a recombinant fragment of non-muscle myosin heavy chain isoform A, and p53. Inhibition of the self-association of S100 proteins might be a novel means of inhibiting their metastasis-promoting activities.

26711254|t|Phosphorylation Regulates the Endocytic Function of the Yeast Dynamin-Related Protein Vps1.
26711254|t|The family of dynamin proteins is known to function in many eukaryotic membrane fusion and fission events. The yeast dynamin-related protein Vps1 functions at several stages of membrane trafficking, including Golgi apparatus to endosome and vacuole, peroxisomal fission, and endocytic scission. We have previously shown that in its endocytic role, Vps1 functions with the amphiphysin heterodimer Rvs161/Rvs167 to facilitate scission and release of vesicles. Phosphoproteome studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a phosphorylation site in Vps1 at serine 599. In this study, we confirmed this phosphorylation event, and we reveal that, like Rvs167, Vps1 can be phosphorylated by the yeast cyclin-associated kinase Pho85 in vivo and in vitro. The importance of this posttranslational modification was revealed when mutagenesis of S599 to a phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable form caused defects in endocytosis but not in other functions associated with Vps1. Mutation to nonphosphorylatable valine inhibited the Rvs167 interaction, while both S599V and S599D caused defects in vesicle scission, as shown by both live-cell imaging and electron microscopy of endocytic invaginations. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Vps1 promote distinct interactions and highlight the importance of such regulatory events in facilitating sequential progression of the endocytic process.

19124613|t|Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the second extracellular loop of type 1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor revealed residues critical for peptide binding.
19124613|t|Upon binding of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) analog sauvagine to the type 1 CRF receptor (CRF(1)), the amino-terminal portion of the peptide has been shown to lie near Lys257 in the receptor's second extracellular loop (EL2). To test the hypothesis that EL2 residues play a role in the binding of sauvagine to CRF(1) we carried out an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study to determine the functional role of EL2 residues (Leu251 to Val266). Only the W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutations reduced the binding affinity and potency of sauvagine. In contrast, these mutations did not seem to significantly alter the overall receptor conformation, in that they left unchanged the affinities of the ligands astressin and antalarmin that have been suggested to bind to different regions of CRF(1). The W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutations also decreased the affinity of the endogenous ligand, CRF, implying that these residues may play a common important role in the binding of different peptides belonging to CRF family. Parallel amino acid deletions of the two peptides produced ligands with various affinities for wild-type CRF(1) compared with the W259A, F260A, and W259A/F260A mutants, supporting the interaction between the amino-terminal residues 8 to 10 of sauvagine and the corresponding region in CRF with EL2 of CRF(1). This is the first time that a specific region of CRF(1) has been implicated in detailed interactions between the receptor and the amino-terminal portion of peptides belonging to the CRF family.

11313253|t|Competition between normal [674C] and mutant [674R] subunits: role of the molecular chaperone BiP in the processing of GPIIb-IIIa complexes.
11313253|t|This work aimed at investigating the function of the [C674R] mutation in GPIIb that disrupts the intramolecular 674 to 687 disulfide bridge. Individuals heterozygous for this mutation show a platelet GPIIb-IIIa content approximately 30% of normal controls, which is less than expected from one normal functioning allele. Coexpression of normal [674C]GPIIb and mutant [674R]GPIIb with normal GPIIIa produced a [674R]GPIIb concentration-dependent inhibition of surface exposure of GPIIb-IIIa complexes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, suggesting that [674R]GPIIb interferes with the association and/or intracellular trafficking of normal subunits. Mutation of either 674C or 687C had similar effects in reducing the surface exposure of GPIIb-IIIa. However, substitution of 674C for A produced a much lesser inhibition than R, suggesting that a positive-charged residue at that position renders a less efficient subunit conformation. The mutant [674R]GPIIb but not normal GPIIb was found associated with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP in transiently transfected CHO cells. BiP was also found associated with [674R]GPIIb-IIIa heterodimers, but not with normal GPIIIa or normal heterodimers. Overexpression of BiP did not increase the surface exposure of [674R]GPIIb-IIIa complexes, indicating that its availability was not a limiting step. Platelets from the thrombasthenic patient expressing [674R]GPIIb-IIIa were found to bind soluble fibrinogen in response to physiologic agonists or dithiothreitol treatment. Thus, the [674R]GPIIb mutation leads to a retardation of the secretory pathway, most likely related to its binding to the molecular chaperone BiP, with the result of a defective number of functional GPIIb-IIIa receptors in the cell surface.

9546424|t|Identification of Tyr-762 in the platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor as the binding site for Crk proteins.
9546424|t|Tyr-762 is an autophosphorylation site in the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor. In order to investigate whether phosphorylated Tyr-762 serves as a docking site for downstream signal transduction molecules, affinity purification using an immobilized synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-762 and its surrounding amino acid residues was performed. Proteins in HeLa cell lysate of molecular sizes 27, 38 and 40 kDa bound to the phosphorylated, but not to the unphosphorylated peptide. Analyses of partial amino acid sequences of the purified proteins indicated that they were identical to CrkI, CrkII and CrkL respectively. The wild-type PDGF alpha-receptor, when expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells, formed complexes with CrkII and CrkL upon ligand stimulation, which was specifically inhibited by a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-762. Replacement of Tyr-762 with a phenylalanine residue in the PDGF alpha-receptor abrogated ligand-induced binding of Crk proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkL increased by 1.8- and 1.3-fold, respectively, upon ligand stimulation of the wild-type alpha-receptor. In contrast, the Y762F mutant PDGF alpha-receptor failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk proteins. CrkII and CrkL constitutively formed complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, in unstimulated as well as PDGF-stimulated cells. Moreover, the activated wild-type PDGF alpha-receptor but not the Y762F mutant receptor was found in a C3G immunoprecipitate, suggesting that a ternary complex between the activated PDGF alpha-receptor, Crk and C3G was formed. DNA synthesis stimulated by PDGF-BB as well as PDGF-induced MAP kinase activation was similar in cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptors. Interestingly, the activated PDGF beta-receptor was found not to bind Crk proteins. Instead, Tyr-771 of the beta-receptor, which is localized at an analogous position to Tyr-762 in the alpha-receptor, binds RasGAP. RasGAP is not bound to the alpha-receptor. Thus, this region in the kinase inserts of the two receptors may be important for the divergency in signaling from the two PDGF receptors.

16107690|t|Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt induced by erythropoietin renders the erythroid differentiation factor GATA-1 competent for TIMP-1 gene transactivation.
16107690|t|The contribution of erythropoietin to the differentiation of the red blood cell lineage remains elusive, and the demonstration of a molecular link between erythropoietin and the transcription of genes associated with erythroid differentiation is lacking. In erythroid cells, expression of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) is strictly dependent on erythropoietin. We report here that erythropoietin regulates the transcription of the TIMP-1 gene upon binding to its receptor in erythroid cells by triggering the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. We found that Akt directly phosphorylates the transcription factor GATA-1 at serine 310 and that this site-specific phosphorylation is required for the transcriptional activation of the TIMP-1 promoter. This chain of events can be recapitulated in nonerythroid cells by transfection of the implicated molecular partners, resulting in the expression of the normally silent endogenous TIMP-1 gene. Conversely, TIMP-1 secretion is profoundly decreased in erythroid cells from fetal livers of transgenic knock-in mice homozygous for a GATA(S310A) gene, which encodes a GATA-1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser(310). Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated expression of GATA(S310A) into GATA-1(null)-derived embryonic stem cells decreases the rate of hemoglobinization by more than 50% compared to expressed wild-type GATA-1. These findings provide the first example of a chain of coupling mechanisms between the binding of erythropoietin to its receptor and GATA-1-dependent gene expression.

1547276|t|Binding of glycoprotein IIIa-derived peptide 217-231 to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factors and its inhibition by platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex.
1547276|t|Based on previous reports in the literature and the high homology between platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa 217-231 and similar portions of other beta subunits of integrin receptors, we hypothesized that this region may participate in ligand binding. Using a polyclonal antibody against GPIIIa 217-231(YC), we tested the interaction of a synthetic peptide representing this region with fibrinogen (Fg), in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. Results show a calcium-independent, dose-related, direct interaction between GPIIIa 217-231(Y) and immobilized Fg. This peptide also bound to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and fibronectin (Fn), but did not attach to a 50 kDa Fn fragment which is deficient in the cell attachment site. In addition, purified GPIIb/IIIa displaced GPIIIa 217-231(Y) from Fg and vWF. Binding of 125I-GPIIIa 217-231(Y) to Fg coated tubes was inhibited by soluble Fg and by the GPIIb/IIIa complex. We synthesized this peptide with several alterations; similar peptides with Pro-219 replaced with an Ala showed significantly reduced binding to Fg and vWF. The decreased binding of the peptides with Pro-219 substitutes suggests that the confirmation of GPIIIa 217-230 is important for its ability to bind to adhesive ligands. In conclusion, the amino acid residues between 217 and 231 of GPIIIa appear to be involved in ligand binding and Pro-219 probably plays a significant role in this interaction.

15864295|t|hMRE11 deficiency leads to microsatellite instability and defective DNA mismatch repair.
15864295|t|DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is essential in the surveillance of accurate transmission of genetic information, and defects in this pathway lead to microsatellite instability and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Our previous study raised the possibility that hMRE11 might be involved in MMR through physical interaction with hMLH1. Here, we show that hMRE11 deficiency leads to significant increase in MSI for both mono- and dinucleotide sequences. Furthermore, RNA-interference-mediated hMRE11-knockdown in HeLa cells results in MMR deficiency. Analysis of seven HNPCC-associated hMLH1 missense mutations located within the hMRE11-interacting domain shows that four mutations (L574P, K618T, R659P and A681T) cause near-complete disruption of the interaction between hMRE11 and hMLH1, and two mutations (Q542L and L582V) cause a 30% reduction of protein interaction. These findings indicate that hMRE11 represents a functional component of the MMR pathway and the disruption of hMLH1-hMRE11 interaction could be an alternative molecular explanation for hMLH1 mutations in a subset of HNPCC tumours.

26639316|t|DARPP-32 interaction with adducin may mediate rapid environmental effects on striatal neurons.
26639316|t|Environmental enrichment has multiple effects on behaviour, including modification of responses to psychostimulant drugs mediated by striatal neurons. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not known. Here we show that DARPP-32, a hub signalling protein in striatal neurons, interacts with adducins, which are cytoskeletal proteins that cap actin filaments' fast-growing ends and regulate synaptic stability. DARPP-32 binds to adducin MARCKS domain and this interaction is modulated by DARPP-32 Ser97 phosphorylation. Phospho-Thr75-DARPP-32 facilitates β-adducin Ser713 phosphorylation through inhibition of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase/phosphatase-2A cascade. Caffeine or 24-h exposure to a novel enriched environment increases adducin phosphorylation in WT, but not T75A mutant mice. This cascade is implicated in the effects of brief exposure to novel enriched environment on dendritic spines in nucleus accumbens and cocaine locomotor response. Our results suggest a molecular pathway by which environmental changes may rapidly alter responsiveness of striatal neurons involved in the reward system.

19351720|t|PTHrP prevents chondrocyte premature hypertrophy by inducing cyclin-D1-dependent Runx2 and Runx3 phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.
19351720|t|In chondrocytes, PTHrP maintains them in a proliferative state and prevents premature hypertrophy. The mechanism by which PTHrP does this is not fully understood. Both Runx2 and Runx3 are required for chondrocyte maturation. We recently demonstrated that cyclin D1 induces Runx2 protein phosphorylation and degradation. In the present studies, we tested the hypothesis that PTHrP regulates both Runx2 and Runx3 protein stability through cyclin D1. We analyzed the effects of cyclin D1 on Runx3 protein stability and function using COS cells, osteoprogenitor C3H10T1/2 cells and chondrogenic RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. We found that cyclin D1 induced Runx3 degradation in a dose-dependent manner and that both Myc-tagged Runx3 and endogenous Runx3 interact directly with CDK4 in COS and RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. A conserved CDK recognition site was identified in the C-terminal region of Runx3 by sequence analysis (residues 356-359). Pulse-chase experiments showed that the mutation of Runx3 at Ser356 to alanine (SA-Runx3) increased the half-life of Runx3. By contrast, the mutation at the same serine residue to glutamic acid (SE-Runx3) accelerated Runx3 degradation. In addition, SA-Runx3 was resistant to cyclin D1-induced degradation. GST-Runx3 was strongly phosphorylated by CDK4 in vitro. By contrast, CDK4 had no effect on the phosphorylation of SA-Runx3. Although both wild-type and SE-Runx3 were ubiquitylated, this was not the case for SA-Runx3. Runx3 degradation by cyclin D1 was completely blocked by the proteasome inhibitor PS1. In C3H10T1/2 cells, SA-Runx3 had a greater effect on reporter activity than SE-Runx3. The same was true for ALP activity in these cells. To investigate the role of cyclin D1 in chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, we analyzed the growth plate morphology and expression of chondrocyte differentiation marker genes in Ccnd1-knockout mice. The proliferating and hypertrophic zones were significantly reduced and expression of chondrocyte differentiation marker genes and ALP activity were enhanced in 2-week-old Ccnd1-knockout mice. PTHrP significantly suppressed protein levels of both Runx2 and Runx3 in primary chondrocytes derived from wild-type mice. By contrast, the suppressive effect of PTHrP on Runx2 and Runx3 protein levels was completely abolished in primary chondrocytes derived from Ccnd1-knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate that the cell cycle proteins cyclin D1 and CDK4 induce Runx2 and Runx3 phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. PTHrP suppresses Runx2 and Runx3 protein levels in chondrocytes through cyclin D1. These results suggest that PTHrP might prevent premature hypertrophy in chondrocytes, at least in part by inducing degradation of Runx2 and Runx3 in a cyclin-D1-dependent manner.

17368182|t|Phosphorylation at serine 208 of the 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 receptor modulates the interaction with transcriptional coactivators.
17368182|t|Upon ligand binding the 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) undergoes a conformational change that allows interaction with coactivator proteins including p160/SRC family members and the multimeric DRIP complex through the DRIP205 subunit. Casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates VDR both in vitro and in vivo at serine 208 within the hinge domain. This phosphorylation does not affect the ability of VDR to bind DNA, but increases its ability to transactivate target promoters. Here, we have analyzed whether phosphorylation of VDR by CKII modulates the ability of VDR to interact with coactivators in vitro. We find that both mutation of serine 208 to aspartic acid (VDRS208D) or phosphorylation of VDR by CKII enhance the interaction of VDR with DRIP205 in the presence of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3. We also find that the mutation VDRS208D neither affects the ability of this protein to bind DNA nor to interact with SRC-1 and RXRalpha. Together, our results indicate that phosphorylation of VDR at serine 208 contributes to modulate the affinity of VDR for the DRIP complex and therefore may have a role in vivo regulating VDR-mediated transcriptional enhancement.

11724794|t|Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is phosphorylated by protein kinase Ciota /lambda and plays a role in microtubule dynamics in the early secretory pathway.
11724794|t|The small GTPase Rab2 immunolocalizes to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that function as transport complexes carrying cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. Our previous studies showed that Rab2 promotes vesicle formation from VTCs and that the released vesicles are enriched in beta-coat protein, protein kinase C iota/lambda (PKCiota/lambda), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the recycling protein p53/gp58. Because PKCiota/lambda kinase activity was necessary for vesicle formation, a search was initiated to identify the substrate(s) that potentiate Rab2 function within VTCs. In this study, we found that PKCiota/lambda phosphorylates GAPDH. Moreover, GAPDH interacts directly with the PKCiota/lambda regulatory domain. Based on numerous observations that show (beta-COP) GAPDH associates with cytoskeletal elements, we examined the role of phospho-GAPDH in promoting microtubule (MT) binding to membrane. Using a quantitative microsomal binding assay, we found that membrane association of beta-tubulin was dependent on phospho-GAPDH and was blocked by reagents that interfere with Rab2-dependent GAPDH membrane recruitment or with PKCiota/lambda kinase activity. Furthermore, normal rat kidney cells transfected with a constitutively activated form of Rab2 (Q65L) or with our anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody displayed a dramatic change in MT organization. These combined results suggest that Rab2 stimulated PKCiota/lambda and GAPDH recruitment to VTCs, and the subsequent PKCiota/lambda phosphorylation of GAPDH ultimately influences MT dynamics in the early secretory pathway.

15735747|t|Functional consequences of G alpha 13 mutations that disrupt interaction with p115RhoGEF.
15735747|t|The G-protein alpha subunit, alpha(13), regulates cell growth and differentiation through the monomeric Rho GTPase. Alpha(13) activates Rho through direct stimulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF, which contains a regulator of G-protein signaling homology domain (RH) in its N-terminus. Through its RH domain, p115RhoGEF also functions as a GAP for G alpha(13). The mechanism for the G alpha(13)/p115RhoGEF interaction is not well understood. Here, we determined specific alpha(13) residues important for its interaction with p115RhoGEF. GST-pulldowns and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that individually mutating alpha(13) residues Lys204, Glu229, or Arg232 to opposite charge residues disrupts the interaction of activated alpha(13) with the RH domain of p115RhoGEF or full-length p115RhoGEF. We further demonstrate that mutation of Glu229, and to a lesser extent Lys204 or Arg232, disrupts the ability of activated alpha(13) to induce the recruitment of p115RhoGEF to the plasma membrane (PM) and to activate Rho-mediated serum response element-luciferase gene transcription. Interestingly, an alpha(13) mutant where a conserved Gly was mutated to a Ser (G205S) retained its ability to bind to p115RhoGEF, induce p115RhoGEF recruitment to the PM, and activate Rho-dependent signaling, even though identical Gly to Ser mutations in other alpha disrupt their interaction with regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. These results demonstrate that, whereas several features of a typical alpha/RGS interaction are preserved in the alpha(13)/p115RhoGEF interaction, there are also significant differences.

11412103|t|NMR analysis of structure and dynamics of the cytosolic tails of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 in aqueous solution.
11412103|t|The structural and dynamic properties of the cytosolic tails of the adhesion receptor integrin alphaIIbbeta3, fused to a coiled-coil construct via (Gly)(3) linkers, were studied in aqueous solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Both tails were largely flexible and unstructured, although, in the beta3 tail, residues Arg(724)-Ala(735) have a propensity to form a helical structure and residues Asn(744)-Tyr(747) (NPLY) have a propensity to adopt reverse-turn conformations. The mutation beta3(Y747A) disrupted this reverse-turn tendency and markedly reduced the affinity of the head domain of the cytoskeletal protein, talin for the beta3 tail. Omission of the (Gly)(3) linker connecting the coiled-coiled helices and the integrin tails lead to helix propagation into the beta3 tail extending up to eight residues. A variety of different tail constructs were made and studied to reveal tail-tail interactions, but surprisingly no significant interactions between both tails could be detected within the context of our constructs. These results provide structural insight into a highly conserved beta tail motif (NPXY/F) required for integrin signaling and highlight a second transiently structured region (residues Arg(724)-Ala(735)), which might also be of functional significance.

10887184|t|Point mutants of c-raf-1 RBD with elevated binding to v-Ha-Ras.
10887184|t|A mutational analysis of the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of c-Raf-1 identified three amino acid positions (Asn(64), Ala(85), and Val(88)) where amino acid substitution with basic residues increases the binding of RBD to recombinant v-Ha-Ras. The greatest increase in binding (6-9-fold) was observed with the A85K-RBD mutant. The elevated binding for the A85K-RBD and V88R-RBD mutants was also detected with Ras expressed in cultured mammalian cells, namely NIH-3T3 and BAF cells. None of the wild type residues in RBD positions Asn(64), Ala(85), and Val(88) have been previously implicated in the interaction with Ras (Block, C., Janknecht, R., Herrmann, C., Nassar, N., and Wittinghofer, A. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 244-251; Nassar, N., Horn, G., Herrmann, C., Scherer, A., McCormick, F., and Wittinghofer, A. (1995) Nature 375, 554-560). The discovery of elevated binding among the mutants in these positions implies that additional RBD residues can be used to generate the Ras. RBD complex. These findings are of particular significance in the design of Ras antagonists based on the RBD prototype. The A85K-RBD mutant can be used to develop an assay for measuring the level of activated Ras in cultured cells; Sepharose-linked A85K-RBD.GST fusion protein served as an activation-specific probe to precipitate Ras.GTP but not Ras.GDP from epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells. A85K-RBD precipitates up to 5-fold more Ras.GTP from mammalian cells than wild type RBD.

11773052|t|Drosophila Ack targets its substrate, the sorting nexin DSH3PX1, to a protein complex involved in axonal guidance.
11773052|t|Dock, the Drosophila orthologue of Nck, is an adaptor protein that is known to function in axonal guidance paradigms in the fly including proper development of neuronal connections in photoreceptor cells and axonal tracking in Bolwig's organ. To develop a better understanding of axonal guidance at the molecular level, we purified proteins in a complex with the SH2 domain of Dock from fly Schneider 2 cells. A protein designated p145 was identified and shown to be a tyrosine kinase with sequence similarity to mammalian Cdc-42-associated tyrosine kinases. We demonstrate that Drosophila Ack (DAck) can be co-immunoprecipitated with Dock and DSH3PX1 from fly cell extracts. The domains responsible for the in vitro interaction between Drosophila Ack and Dock were identified, and direct protein-protein interactions between complex members were established. We conclude that DSH3PX1 is a substrate for DAck in vivo and in vitro and define one of the major in vitro sites of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation to be Tyr-56. Tyr-56 is located within the SH3 domain of DSH3PX1, placing it in an important position for regulating the binding of proline-rich targets. We demonstrate that Tyr-56 phosphorylation by DAck diminishes the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain interaction with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein while enabling DSH3PX1 to associate with Dock. Furthermore, when Tyr-56 is mutated to aspartate or glutamate, the binding to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein is abrogated. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 by DAck targets this sorting nexin to a protein complex that includes Dock, an adaptor protein important for axonal guidance.

8623535|t|Domains of the E1 protein of human papillomavirus type 33 involved in binding to the E2 protein.
8623535|t|Papillomavirus E1 and E2 proteins are essential for the initiation of viral DNA replication. We have now analyzed the interaction of E1 and E2 of human papillomavirus type 33, which is associated with cervical carcinoma. When synthesized in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, the E1 and E2 proteins interacted efficiently at 4 degree. A monoclonal antibody recognizing E1 amino acids 584--600 inhibited the binding of E2 and vice versa, indicating that these amino acids are involved in E2 binding. To confirm this result, a mutational analysis of E1 was performed. The E2 binding activity of E1 deletion and point mutant proteins was assayed using glutathione S-transferase E1 fusion proteins and in vitro translated proteins. At 4 degree, the C-terminal portion of E1 including amino acids 312--644 was sufficient for E2 binding. Introduction of C-terminal deletions or a point mutation at position 586 (Pro --> Glu) resulted in the loss of the E2 binding activity. A second more N-terminally located binding domain (E1 amino acids 312--450) became active when the assays were performed at 22 degrees. The monoclonal antibody still inhibited E2 binding at this temperature, indicating that both E2 binding domains are engaged in the context of the full-length protein.

15714521|t|Role of beta-galactosidase and elastin binding protein in lysosomal and nonlysosomal complexes of patients with GM1-gangliosidosis.
15714521|t|G(M1)-gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase (GLB1). The GLB1 gene gives rise to the GLB1 lysosomal enzyme and to the elastin binding protein (EBP), involved in elastic fiber deposition. GLB1 forms a complex with protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA), alpha neuraminidase (NEU1), and galactosamine 6-sulphate sulfatase (GALNS) inside lysosomes, while EBP binds to PPCA and NEU1 on the cell surface. We investigated the function of the GLB1 and EBP mutated proteins by analyzing the clinical, genetic, and cellular data of 11 G(M1)-gangliosidosis patients. Their molecular analysis, followed by expression studies, lead to the identification of four new and 10 known GLB1 mutations. Some common amino acid substitutions [c.1445G>A (p.Arg482H), c.622C>T (p.Arg208His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys) and c.176G>A (p.Arg59His)] were present in the GLB1 enzyme of several patients, all of Mediterranean origin, suggesting a common origin. Western blotting analyses against GLB1, EBP, and PPCA proteins showed that the identified mutations affect GLB1 enzyme activity and/or stability. The c.1445G>A (p.Arg482His), c.175C>T (p.Arg59Cys), c.733+2T>C, c.1736G>A (p.Gly579Asp), and c.1051C>T (p.Arg351X) GLB1 mutations, affect the stabilization of PPCA probably because they hamper the interaction between GLB1/EBP and PPCA within the multiprotein complex. The amount of EBP was normal, but the detection of impaired elastogenesis in such patients suggests an alteration in its function. We conclude that the presence of genetic lesions in both GLB1 and EBP coding region does not directly predict impaired elastogenesis and that elastic fiber assembly has to be evaluated specifically in each case. Nevertheless, the degree of EBP involvement may be linked to specific clinical findings.

10377409|t|Ezrin, a plasma membrane-microfilament linker, signals cell survival through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
10377409|t|ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins function as plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton linkers and participate in the formation of specialized domains of the plasma membrane. We have investigated ezrin function in tubulogenesis of a kidney-derived epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1. Here we show that cells overproducing a mutant form of ezrin in which Tyr-353 was changed to a phenylalanine (Y353F) undergo apoptosis when assayed for tubulogenesis. While investigating the mechanism responsible for this apoptosis, we found that ezrin interacts with p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Two distinct sites of ezrin are involved in this interaction, the amino-terminal domain containing the first 309 aa and the phosphorylated Tyr-353 residue, which binds to the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Cells producing Y353F ezrin are defective in activation of the protein kinase Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase that protects cells against apoptosis. Furthermore, the apoptotic phenotype of these cells is rescued by production of a constitutively activated form of PI 3-kinase. Taken together, these results establish a novel function for ezrin in determining survival of epithelial cells by activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway.

12393553|t|Shielding the front-strand beta 3 of the von Willebrand factor A1 domain inhibits its binding to platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha.
12393553|t|Platelet adhesion to damaged vessel wall and shear-induced platelet aggregation necessitate binding of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1 domain to platelet GPIbalpha. Blocking this interaction represents a promising approach to the treatment of arterial thrombosis. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the VWF A1 domain in several species, expressing VWF recognized by the blocking monoclonal antibody AJvW-2, suggested 9 residues (His563, Ile566, Asp570, Ala581, Val584, Ala587, Arg616, Ala618, and Met622) to contribute to the epitope for AJvW-2 or to be part of the GPIbalpha-binding site. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-human VWF A1 fusion proteins, in which these amino acids were mutated to their murine counterparts, were tested for their capacity to bind AJvW-2 or heparin, to interfere with botrocetin- or ristocetin-mediated VWF binding to GPIb, or to induce flow-dependent platelet tethering in a perfusion chamber. Thus, mutations His563Arg, Ile566Leu, Asp570Ala, and Ala587Thr, clustered on the outer surface of the A1 domain, dramatically impaired binding of AJvW-2 to A1. The His563Arg, Ile566Leu, and Asp570Ala mutations also impaired the binding of heparin, which competes with AJvW-2 for binding to A1. Perfusion studies revealed that His563, Ile566, Asp570, Arg616, and Ala618 take part in GPIbalpha binding, their mutation-impairing platelet recruitment. In agreement with the surface distribution of VWF type 2M mutations, this study demonstrates overlapping of the epitope for AJvW-2 and the GPIbalpha-binding site, located around the front pocket of the A1 domain and defined by strands beta3, beta4, and helix alpha3, and it provides a mechanistic basis for VWF neutralization by this antibody.

24483153|t|A novel point mutation of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance through impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the p160 coactivators: dissociation of the transactivating and transreppressive activities.
24483153|t|CONTEXT: Primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized, partial, target-tissue insensitivity to glucocorticoids. The molecular basis of the condition has been ascribed to inactivating mutations in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to present three new cases caused by a novel mutation in the hGR gene and to delineate the molecular mechanisms through which the mutant receptor impairs glucocorticoid signal transduction. DESIGN AND RESULTS: The index case (father) and his two daughters presented with increased urinary free cortisol excretion and resistance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to dexamethasone suppression in the absence of clinical manifestations suggestive of Cushing syndrome. All subjects harbored a novel, heterozygous, point mutation (T→G) at nucleotide position 1724 of the hGR gene, which resulted in substitution of valine by glycine at amino acid 575 of the receptor. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the hGRαV575G demonstrated a significant (33%) reduction in its ability to transactivate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in response to dexamethasone, a 50% decrease in its affinity for the ligand, and a 2.5-fold delay in nuclear translocation. Although it did not exert a dominant negative effect on the wild-type receptor and preserved its ability to bind to DNA, hGRαV575G displayed significantly enhanced (∼80%) ability to transrepress the nuclear factor-κΒ signaling pathway. Finally, the mutant receptor hGRαV575G demonstrated impaired interaction with the LXXLL motif of the glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 coactivator in vitro and in computer-based structural simulation via its defective activation function-2 (AF-2) domain. CONCLUSIONS: The natural mutant receptor hGRαV575G causes primary generalized glucocorticoid resistance by affecting multiple steps in the glucocorticoid signaling cascade, including the affinity for the ligand, the time required for nuclear translocation, and the interaction with the glucocorticoid-interacting protein-1 coactivator.

11880649|t|Antivirally active MxA protein sequesters La Crosse virus nucleocapsid protein into perinuclear complexes.
11880649|t|Bunyaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. New viral particles are formed by budding of nucleocapsids into the Golgi apparatus. We have previously shown that the IFN-induced human MxA protein inhibits bunyavirus replication by an unknown mechanism. Here we demonstrate that MxA binds to the nucleocapsid protein of La Crosse virus (LACV) and colocalizes with the viral protein in cytoplasmic complexes. Electron microscopy revealed that these complexes accumulated in the perinuclear area and consisted of highly ordered fibrillary structures. A similar MxA-mediated redistribution of viral nucleocapsid proteins was detected with other bunyaviruses, such as Bunyamwera virus and Rift Valley fever virus. MxA(E645R), a carboxy-terminal mutant of MxA without antiviral activity against LACV, did not lead to complex formation. Wild-type MxA, but not MxA(E645R), was able to bind to LACV nucleocapsid protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the importance of the carboxy-terminal effector domain of MxA. These results illustrate an efficient mechanism of IFN action whereby an essential virus component is trapped in cytoplasmic inclusions and becomes unavailable for the generation of new virus particles.

9305633|t|A small region in phosducin inhibits G-protein betagamma-subunit function.
9305633|t|G-protein betagamma-subunits (G(betagamma)) are active transmembrane signalling components. Their function recently has been observed to be regulated by the cytosolic protein phosducin. We show here that a small fragment (amino acids 215-232) contained in the C-terminus of phosducin is sufficient for high-affinity interactions with G(betagamma). Corresponding peptides not only disrupt G(betagamma)-G(alpha) interactions, as defined by G(betagamma)-stimulated GTPase activity of alpha(o), but also other G(betagamma)-mediated functions. The NMR structure of a peptide encompassing this region shows a loop exposing the side chains of Glu223 and Tyr224, and peptides with a substitution of either of these amino acids show a complete loss of activity towards G(o). Mutation of this Tyr224 to Ala in full-length phosducin reduced the functional activity of phosducin to that of phosducin's isolated N-terminus, indicating the importance of this residue within the short, structurally defined C-terminal segment. This small peptide derived from phosducin, may represent a model of a G(betagamma) inhibitor, and illustrates the potential of small compounds to affect G(betagamma) functions.

9058485|t|beta 3 integrin-derived peptides 214-218 and 217-231 have been shown previously to inhibit platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to platelets and to purified receptor. In this paper we study the activity of both peptides in inhibition of binding of biotinylated fibrinogen to activated platelets and to immobilized alpha IIb beta 3 receptor. We found that the mechanism of this inhibition by both peptides is different 125I-labeled 214-218 peptide binds to alpha IIb beta 3 but in contrast, 125I-labeled 217-231 peptide binds to the A alpha-chain of native and gamma' fibrinogen, as judged by the cross-linking study. In solid phase assay both purified alpha IIb beta 3 and 217-231 peptide bound extensively to native and recombinant fibrinogen, and to fibrinogen with either D574E or D97E mutations in the A alpha-chain. Binding of purified alpha IIb beta 3 to gamma' fibrinogen was markedly impaired whereas binding of 217-231 was only slightly impaired in comparison with native fibrinogen. Binding of 217-231 to fibrinogen fragment X was also reduced suggesting that sequences other than RGDS and RGDF may represent binding sites for this peptide. We hypothesize that the close vicinity of fibrinogen binding site (217-231) and of the site participating in conformational changes of the alpha IIb beta 3 receptor (214-218) may facilitate fibrinogen interaction with its receptor.

7721887|t|Identification of three tyrosine residues of glycoprotein Ib alpha with distinct roles in von Willebrand factor and alpha-thrombin binding.
7721887|t|The interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex is essential for platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury under high shear stress flow conditions. Moreover, GP Ib-IX-V may contribute to the mechanisms of platelet activation through its high affinity binding of alpha-thrombin. There are two distinct but partially overlapping regions of GP Ib alpha thought to be involved in interacting with vWF (residues 251-279) and alpha-thrombin (residues 271-284); they share three tyrosine residues (positions 276, 278, and 279) that have recently been shown to be sulfated (Dong, J., Li, C. Q., and Lopez, J.A. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 13946-13953). To define the functional role of these three residues, we have introduced selected mutations in a soluble recombinant GP Ib alpha fragment (corresponding to the sequence 1-302 of the mature protein) that binds vWF and alpha-thrombin with the same attributes as intact GP Ib-IX-V complex. Fragments containing a single Tyr-->Phe substitution either at position 276 or 278 or 279 exhibited normal interaction with vWF but markedly reduced or absent binding of alpha-thrombin. GP Ib alpha fragment with normal sequence but synthesized under sulfate-free conditions also failed to bind alpha-thrombin and, in addition, had markedly reduced interaction with vWF. The simultaneous substitution of three neighboring Asp residues with Asn at positions 272, 274, and 277, a multiple mutation that may impair Tyr sulfation, also resulted in loss of binding of both ligands. These results define distinct structural features of GP Ib alpha selectively involved in supporting the interaction with vWF or alpha-thrombin.

16702958|t|Functional analysis of the regulatory requirements of B-Raf and the B-Raf(V600E) oncoprotein.
16702958|t|The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 6% of human cancers and mimics the phosphorylation of the kinase domain activation segment. In wild-type B-Raf (B-Raf(wt)), activation segment phosphorylation is thought to cooperate with negative charges within the N-region for full activation. In contrast to Raf-1, the N-region of B-Raf is constitutively negatively charged owing to the presence of residues D447/D448 and the phosphorylation of S446. Therefore, it has been suggested that this hallmark predisposes B-Raf for oncogenic activation. In this study, we demonstrate that neutralizing mutations of these residues (in particular S446 and S447), or uncoupling of B-Raf from Ras-guanine 5'-triphosphate (GTP), strongly reduce the biological activity of B-Raf in a PC12 cell differentiation assay. We also confirm that S365 is a 14-3-3 binding site, and determine that mutation of this residue rescues the impaired biological activity of B-Raf proteins with a neutralized N-region, suggesting that the N-region opposes a 14-3-3-mediated transition into an inactive conformation. However, in the case of B-Raf(V600E), although complete N-region neutralization resulted in a 2.5-fold reduction in kinase activity in vitro, this oncoprotein strongly induced PC12 differentiation or transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of MCF-10A cells regardless of its N-region charge. Furthermore, the biological activity of B-Raf(V600E) was independent of its ability to bind Ras-GTP. Our analysis identifies important regulatory differences between B-Raf(wt) and B-Raf(V600E) and suggests that B-Raf(V600E) cannot be inhibited by strategies aimed at blocking S446 phosphorylation or Ras activation.

9067577|t|The BCR/ABL oncogene alters interaction of the adapter proteins CRKL and CRK with cellular proteins.
9067577|t|The Philadelphia chromosome translocation generates a chimeric oncogene, BCR/ABL, which causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In primary leukemic neutrophils from patients with CML, the major tyrosine phosphorylated protein is CRKL, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein which has an overall homology of 60% to CRK, the human homologue of the v-crk oncogene. In cell lines transformed by BCR/ABL, CRKL was tyrosine phosphorylated, while CRK was not. We looked for changes in CRK- and CRKL-binding proteins in Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell lines which were transformed by BCR/ABL. Anti-CRK II or anti-CRKL immunoprecipitates were probed by far Western blotting with CRK II- or CRKL-GST fusion proteins to display CRK- and CRKL-coprecipitating proteins. There was a striking qualitative difference in the proteins coprecipitating with CRKL and CRK II. In untransformed cells, three major proteins coprecipitated with CRKL, identified as C3G, SOS and c-ABL. Each of these proteins was found to interact with the CRKL-SH3 domains, but not the SH2 domain. After BCR/ABL transformation, the CRKL SH3-domain binding proteins did not change, with the exception that BCR/ABL now coprecipitated with CRKL. Compared to CRKL, very few proteins coprecipitated with CRK II in untransformed, quiescent cells. After BCR/ABL transformation, both the CRKL- and CRK-SH2 domains bound to a new complex of proteins of approximate molecular weight 105-120 kDa. The major protein in this complex was identified as p120CBL. Thus, in these hematopoietic cell lines, CRKL is involved to a greater extent than CRK II in normal signaling pathways that involve c-ABL, C3G and SOS. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL but not CRK II, appears to form complexes which potentially link BCR/ABL, c-ABL, C3G, and SOS to the protooncoprotein, p120CBL.

10504396|t|Definition of receptor binding sites on human interleukin-11 by molecular modeling-guided mutagenesis.
10504396|t|Interleukin-11 (IL-11) belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-type subfamily of long-chain helical cytokines including IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1, which all share the glycoprotein gp130 as a signal transducing receptor component. IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.

15589845|t|Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is a key regulator of cell size and growth. It is regulated via phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. We demonstrate for the first time that CoA synthase associates specifically with S6K1. The association was observed between native and transiently overexpressed proteins in vivo, as well as by BIAcore analysis in vitro. The sites of interaction were mapped to the C-terminal regions of both CoA synthase and S6K1. In vitro studies indicated that the interaction does not affect their enzymatic activities and that CoA synthase is not a substrate for S6 kinase. This study uncovers a potential link between mTor/S6K signaling pathway and energy metabolism through CoA and its thioester derivatives, but its physiological relevance should be further elucidated.

7559499|t|Phosphorylation of tyrosine 503 in the erythropoietin receptor (EpR) is essential for binding the P85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and for EpR-associated PI 3-kinase activity.
7559499|t|We recently reported that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase becomes associated with the activated erythropoietin receptor (EpR), most likely through the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains within the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase and one or more phosphorylated tyrosines within the EpR. We have now investigated this interaction in more detail and have found, based on both blotting studies with glutathione S-transferase-p85-SH2 fusion proteins and binding of these fusion proteins to SDS-denatured EpRs, that this binding is direct. Moreover, both in vitro competition studies, involving phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences flanking the eight tyrosines within the intracellular domain of the EpR, and in vivo studies with mutant EpRs bearing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr503 within the EpR is essential for the binding of PI 3-kinase. The presence of PI 3-kinase activity in EpR immunoprecipitates from DA-3 cells infected with wild-type but not Y503F EpRs confirms this finding. Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domains of p85 can bind, in addition to their well established Tyr-Met/Val-X-Met consensus binding sequence, a Tyr-Val-Ala-Cys motif that is present in the EpR. A comparison of erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylations and proliferation of wild-type and Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells revealed no differences. However, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, markedly inhibited the erythropoietin-induced proliferation of both cell types, suggesting that PI 3-kinase is activated in Y503F EpR expressing cells. This was confirmed by carrying out PI 3-kinase assays with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from erythropoietin-stimulated Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells and suggested that PI 3-kinase has a role in regulating erythropoietin-induced proliferation, but at a site distinct from the EpR.

19933846|t|Impact of feedback phosphorylation and Raf heterodimerization on normal and mutant B-Raf signaling.
19933846|t|The B-Raf kinase is a Ras pathway effector activated by mutation in numerous human cancers and certain developmental disorders. Here we report that normal and oncogenic B-Raf proteins are subject to a regulatory cycle of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent feedback phosphorylation, followed by PP2A- and Pin1-dependent dephosphorylation/recycling. We identify four S/TP sites of B-Raf phosphorylated by activated ERK and find that feedback phosphorylation of B-Raf inhibits binding to activated Ras and disrupts heterodimerization with C-Raf, which is dependent on the B-Raf pS729/14-3-3 binding site. Moreover, we find that events influencing Raf heterodimerization can alter the transforming potential of oncogenic B-Raf proteins possessing intermediate or impaired kinase activity but have no significant effect on proteins with high kinase activity, such as V600E B-Raf. Mutation of the feedback sites or overexpression of the Pin1 prolyl-isomerase, which facilitates B-Raf dephosphorylation/recycling, resulted in increased transformation, whereas mutation of the S729/14-3-3 binding site or expression of dominant negative Pin1 reduced transformation. Mutation of each feedback site caused increased transformation and correlated with enhanced heterodimerization and activation of C-Raf. Finally, we find that B-Raf and C-Raf proteins containing mutations identified in certain developmental disorders constitutively heterodimerize and that their signaling activity can also be modulated by feedback phosphorylation.

17510211|t|EGFR regulates RhoA-GTP dependent cell motility in E-cadherin mutant cells.
17510211|t|Gastric cancer associated E-cadherin germline missense mutations lead to significant functional consequences, in both the structural and signalling properties of the protein. In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-dependent EGFR activation contributes to enhanced cell motility, in a mechanism involving RhoA activation.

9791008|t|The use of the yeast two hybrid system to evaluate ErbB-3 interactions with SH2 domain containing proteins.
9791008|t|Several mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB-3 have been postulated to render this enzyme catalytically inactive. To test which amino acid mutations in ErbB-3 might be critical for kinase inactivation, we used a yeast two hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction. We monitored restoration of ErbB-3 kinase activity by investigating the ability of wild type or mutant ErbB-3 to associate with the SH2 containing proteins Syp and Phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Our results demonstrate that changing individual amino acids to tyrosine kinase consensus sequences did not increase the interaction of ErbB-3 with Syp or PI3K. Mutation of the consensus Asp832 of rat ErbB-3 to Asn observed in human and bovine ErbB-3 significantly increased the interaction of ErbB-3 and Syp and PI3K 11 or 26 fold respectively. A double mutant (Asp832Asn, Asp757 His) exhibited a 96 or 350 fold increase in the ability to bind PI3K and Syp.

16775013|t|MARK2/EMK1/Par-1Balpha phosphorylation of Rab11-family interacting protein 2 is necessary for the timely establishment of polarity in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.
16775013|t|Rab11a, myosin Vb, and the Rab11-family interacting protein 2 (FIP2) regulate plasma membrane recycling in epithelial cells. This study sought to characterize more fully Rab11-FIP2 function by identifying kinase activities modifying Rab11-FIP2. We have found that gastric microsomal membrane extracts phosphorylate Rab11-FIP2 on serine 227. We identified the kinase that phosphorylated Rab11-FIP2 as MARK2/EMK1/Par-1Balpha (MARK2), and recombinant MARK2 phosphorylated Rab11-FIP2 only on serine 227. We created stable Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-Rab11-FIP2 wild type or a nonphosphorylatable mutant [Rab11-FIP2(S227A)]. Analysis of these cell lines demonstrates a new role for Rab11-FIP2 in addition to that in the plasma membrane recycling system. In calcium switch assays, cells expressing Rab11-FIP2(S227A) showed a defect in the timely reestablishment of p120-containing junctional complexes. However, Rab11-FIP2(S227A) did not affect localization with recycling system components or the normal function of apical recycling and transcytosis pathways. These results indicate that phosphorylation of Rab11-FIP2 on serine 227 by MARK2 regulates an alternative pathway modulating the establishment of epithelial polarity.

17594292|t|Phosphorylation of CK1delta: identification of Ser370 as the major phosphorylation site targeted by PKA in vitro and in vivo.
17594292|t|The involvement of CK1 (casein kinase 1) delta in the regulation of multiple cellular processes implies a tight regulation of its activity on many different levels. At the protein level, reversible phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating the activity of CK1delta. In the present study, we show that PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), Akt (protein kinase B), CLK2 (CDC-like kinase 2) and PKC (protein kinase C) alpha all phosphorylate CK1delta. PKA was identified as the major cellular CK1deltaCK (CK1delta C-terminal-targeted protein kinase) for the phosphorylation of CK1delta in vitro and in vivo. This was implied by the following evidence: PKA was detectable in the CK1deltaCK peak fraction of fractionated MiaPaCa-2 cell extracts, PKA shared nearly identical kinetic properties with those of CK1deltaCK, and both PKA and CK1deltaCK phosphorylated CK1delta at Ser370 in vitro. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CK1delta by PKA decreased substrate phosphorylation of CK1delta in vitro. Mutation of Ser370 to alanine increased the phosphorylation affinity of CK1delta for beta-casein and the GST (gluthatione S-transferase)-p53 1-64 fusion protein in vitro and enhanced the formation of an ectopic dorsal axis during Xenopus laevis development. Anchoring of PKA and CK1delta to centrosomes was mediated by AKAP (A-kinase-anchoring protein) 450. Interestingly, pre-incubation of MiaPaCa-2 cells with the synthetic peptide St-Ht31, which prevents binding between AKAP450 and the regulatory subunit RII of PKA, resulted in a 6-fold increase in the activity of CK1delta. In summary, we conclude that PKA phosphorylates CK1delta, predominantly at Ser370 in vitro and in vivo, and that site-specific phosphorylation of CK1delta by PKA plays an important role in modulating CK1delta-dependent processes.

16877710|t|Integrin alphaIIbbeta3:ligand interactions are linked to binding-site remodeling.
16877710|t|This study tested the hypothesis that high-affinity binding of macromolecular ligands to the alphaIIbbeta3 integrin is tightly coupled to binding-site remodeling, an induced-fit process that shifts a conformational equilibrium from a resting toward an open receptor. Interactions between alphaIIbbeta3 and two model ligands-echistatin, a 6-kDa recombinant protein with an RGD integrin-targeting sequence, and fibrinogen's gamma-module, a 30-kDa recombinant protein with a KQAGDV integrin binding site-were measured by sedimentation velocity, fluorescence anisotropy, and a solid-phase binding assay, and modeled by molecular graphics. Studying echistatin variants (R24A, R24K, D26A, D26E, D27W, D27F), we found that electrostatic contacts with charged residues at the alphaIIb/beta3 interface, rather than nonpolar contacts, perturb the conformation of the resting integrin. Aspartate 26, which interacts with the nearby MIDAS cation, was essential for binding, as D26A and D26E were inactive. In contrast, R24K was fully and R24A partly active, indicating that the positively charged arginine 24 contributes to, but is not required for, integrin recognition. Moreover, we demonstrated that priming--i.e., ectodomain conformational changes and oligomerization induced by incubation at 35 degrees C with the ligand-mimetic peptide cHarGD--promotes complex formation with fibrinogen's gamma-module. We also observed that the gamma-module's flexible carboxy terminus was not required for alphaIIbbeta3 integrin binding. Our studies differentiate priming ligands, which bind to the resting receptor and perturb its conformation, from regulated ligands, where binding-site remodeling must first occur. Echistatin's binding energy is sufficient to rearrange the subunit interface, but regulated ligands like fibrinogen must rely on priming to overcome conformational barriers.

12417530|t|Mutations in congenital myasthenic syndromes reveal an epsilon subunit C-terminal cysteine, C470, crucial for maturation and surface expression of adult AChR.
12417530|t|Many congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are associated with mutations in the genes encoding the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), an oligomeric protein with the structure alpha(2)betadelta epsilon. AChR deficiency is frequently due to homozygous or heteroallelic mutations in the AChR epsilon subunit, most of which cause truncation of the polypeptide chain and loss of surface expression of AChR. Here we identified mutations epsilon 1369delG and epsilon Y458X, located in the 18 amino acid epsilon subunit C-terminus that lies extracellular to the M4 transmembrane domain. We then incorporated green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the intracellular loop between M3 and M4 of mutant or wild-type epsilon subunits and expressed the AChRs in RD or HEK 293 cells. AChR containing wild-type GFP-tagged epsilon subunits were incorporated into the surface membrane, whereas the GFP-tagged AChR mutant epsilon subunits co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker and were not expressed on the cell surface. In addition, mutant AChRs did not reach the cell surface, as measured by labelling of intact cells with (125)I-alpha-bungarotoxin and precipitation with an epsilon-subunit-specific antiserum. Mutagenesis studies showed that cysteine 470, located four amino acids from the C-terminus, is essential for alpha/epsilon assembly and surface expression of adult AChR. Replacement of cysteine 470 by serine does not restore alpha/epsilon assembly or surface expression. Our results provide the first use of GFP-tagged AChR as a tool for investigation of CMS and demonstrate a previously undetermined role for a disulphide-bonded cystine in the epsilon subunit C-terminus, which plays a crucial role in expression of the adult AChR.

9060610|t|Dominant-negative mutants of human MxA protein: domains in the carboxy-terminal moiety are important for oligomerization and antiviral activity.
9060610|t|Human MxA protein is an interferon-induced 76-kDa GTPase that exhibits antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. Wild-type MxA accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells. TMxA, a modified form of wild-type MxA carrying a foreign nuclear localization signal, accumulates in the cell nucleus. Here we show that MxA protein is translocated into the nucleus together with TMxA when both proteins are expressed simultaneously in the same cell, demonstrating that MxA molecules form tight complexes in living cells. To define domains important for MxA-MxA interaction and antiviral function in vivo, we expressed mutant forms of MxA together with wild-type MxA or TMxA in appropriate cells and analyzed subcellular localization and interfering effects. An MxA deletion mutant, MxA(359-572), formed heterooligomers with TMxA and was translocated to the nucleus, indicating that the region between amino acid positions 359 and 572 contains an interaction domain which is critical for oligomerization of MxA proteins. Mutant T103A with threonine at position 103 replaced by alanine had lost both GTPase and antiviral activities. T103A exhibited a dominant-interfering effect on the antiviral activity of wild-type MxA rendering MxA-expressing cells susceptible to infection with influenza A virus, Thogoto virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. To determine which sequences are critical for the dominant-negative effect of T103A, we expressed truncated forms of T103A together with wild-type protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the last 90 amino acids had lost interfering capacity, indicating that an intact C terminus was required. Surprisingly, a truncated version of MxA representing only the C-terminal half of the molecule exerted also a dominant-negative effect on wild-type function, demonstrating that sequences in the C-terminal moiety of MxA are necessary and sufficient for interference. However, all MxA mutants formed hetero-oligomers with TMxA and were translocated to the nucleus, indicating that physical interaction alone is not sufficient for disturbing wild-type function. We propose that dominant-negative mutants directly influence wild-type activity within hetero-oligomers or else compete with wild-type MxA for a cellular or viral target.

12193273|t|Delineation of RAID1, the RACK1 interaction domain located within the unique N-terminal region of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5.
12193273|t|BACKGROUND: The cyclic AMP specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5 interacts with the beta-propeller protein RACK1 to form a signaling scaffold complex in cells. Two-hybrid analysis of truncation and mutant constructs of the unique N-terminal region of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE4D5 were used to define a domain conferring interaction with the signaling scaffold protein, RACK1. RESULTS: Truncation and mutagenesis approaches showed that the RACK1-interacting domain on PDE4D5 comprised a cluster of residues provided by Asn-22/Pro-23/Trp-24/Asn-26 together with a series of hydrophobic amino acids, namely Leu-29, Val-30, Leu-33, Leu-37 and Leu-38 in a 'Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Leu' repeat. This was done by 2-hybrid analyses and then confirmed in biochemical pull down analyses using GST-RACK1 and mutant PDE4D5 forms expressed in COS cells. Mutation of Arg-34, to alanine, in PDE4D5 attenuated its interaction with RACK1 both in 2-hybrid screens and in pull down analyses. A 38-mer peptide, whose sequence reflected residues 12 through 49 of PDE4D5, bound to RACK1 with similar affinity to native PDE4D5 itself (Ka circa 6 nM). CONCLUSIONS: The RACK1 Interaction Domain on PDE4D5, that we here call RAID1, is proposed to form an amphipathic helical structure that we suggest may interact with the C-terminal beta-propeller blades of RACK1 in a manner akin to the interaction of the helical G-gamma signal transducing protein with the beta-propeller protein, G-beta.

17056590|t|Importin-mediated nuclear translocation of galectin-3.
17056590|t|Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of a beta-galactoside-binding protein family, is involved in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation through activation of transcription factors when translocated to the nucleus. We have previously shown that Gal-3 can import into the nucleus through at least two pathways; via passive diffusion and/or active transport (Nakahara, S., Oka, N., Wang, Y., Hogan, V., Inohara, H, and Raz, A. (2006) Cancer Res. 66, 9995-10006). Here, we investigated the process mediated by the active nuclear transport of Gal-3 and have identified a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like motif in its protein sequence, (223)HRVKKL(228), that resembles p53 and c-Myc NLSs ((378)SRHKKL(383), (322)AKRVKL(327)), respectively. Moreover, trimers of enhanced green fluorescence protein (3xGFP) fused with this NLS-like sequence, which is too large to passively diffuse through the nuclear pores, accumulated in the cell nuclei. To gain insights into this newly identified nuclear import mechanism, the interaction between Gal-3 and importins (importins alpha and beta) that carry the NLS harboring nuclear proteins into the nucleus, was investigated. Pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that wild-type Gal-3, but not mutant Gal-3 (R224A), binds to importin-alpha. Down-regulation of importin-beta by RNA interference (RNAi) efficiently abrogates its nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that impaired nuclear translocation of mutant Gal-3 protein (R224A) results in accelerated degradation compared with the wild-type protein. Thus, these results suggest that Gal-3 is translocated to the nucleus, in part, via the importin-alpha/beta route and that Arg(224) amino acid residue of human Gal-3 is essential for its active nuclear translocation and its molecular stability.

22811067|t|Dimerization in the Grb7 protein.
22811067|t|In previous studies, we showed that the tyrosine phosphorylation state of growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (Grb7) affects its ability to bind to the transcription regulator FHL2 and the cortactin-interacting protein, human HS-1-associated protein-1. Here, we present results describing the importance of dimerization in the Grb7-Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in terms of its structural integrity and the ability to bind phosphorylated tyrosine peptide ligands. A tyrosine phosphorylation-mimic mutant (Y80E-Grb7-SH2) is largely dimerization deficient and binds a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide representative of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) erbB2 with differing thermodynamic characteristics than the wild-type SH2 domain. Another dimerization-deficient mutant (F99R-Grb7-SH2) binds the phosphorylated erbB2 peptide with similarly changed thermodynamic characteristics. Both Y80E-Grb7-SH2 and F99R-Grb7-SH2 are structured by circular dichroism measurements but show reduced thermal stability relative to the wild type-Grb7-SH2 domain as measured by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance. It is well known that the dimerization state of RTKs (as binding partners to adaptor proteins such as Grb7) plays an important role in their regulation. Here, we propose the phosphorylation state of Grb7-SH2 domain tyrosine residues could control Grb7 dimerization, and dimerization may be an important regulatory step in Grb7 binding to RTKs such as erbB2. In this manner, additional dimerization-dependent regulation could occur downstream of the membrane-bound kinase in RTK-mediated signaling pathways.

17244621|t|A germ line mutation in the death domain of DAPK-1 inactivates ERK-induced apoptosis.
17244621|t|p53 is activated genetically by a set of kinases that are components of the calcium calmodulin kinase superfamily, including CHK2, AMP kinase, and DAPK-1. In dissecting the mechanism of DAPK-1 control, a novel mutation (N1347S) was identified in the death domain of DAPK-1. The N1347S mutation prevented the death domain module binding stably to ERK in vitro and in vivo. Gel filtration demonstrated that the N1347S mutation disrupted the higher order oligomeric nature of the purified recombinant death domain miniprotein. Accordingly, the N1347S death domain module is defective in vivo in the formation of high molecular weight oligomeric intermediates after cross-linking with ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate). Full-length DAPK-1 protein harboring a N1347S mutation in the death domain was also defective in binding to ERK in cells and was defective in formation of an ethylene glycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate)-cross-linked intermediate in vivo. Full-length DAPK-1 encoding the N1347S mutation was attenuated in tumor necrosis factor receptor-induced apoptosis. However, the N1347S mutation strikingly prevented ERK:DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis as defined by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, Annexin V staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling imaging. Significant penetrance of the N1347S allele was identified in normal genomic DNA indicating the mutation is germ line, not tumor derived. The frequency observed in genomic DNA was from 37 to 45% for homozygous wild-type, 41 to 47% for heterozygotes, and 12 to 15% for homozygous mutant. These data highlight a naturally occurring DAPK-1 mutation that alters the oligomeric structure of the death domain, de-stabilizes DAPK-1 binding to ERK, and prevents ERK:DAPK-1-dependent apoptosis.

21325834|t|Na+-H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) PDZ scaffold binds an internal binding site in the scavenger receptor megalin.
21325834|t|The scavenger receptor megalin binds to albumin in the microvilli of the renal proximal tubule, and transports the ligand to the intravillar cleft for processing by endocytosis. Albumin endocytosis in the proximal tubule is regulated by protein complexes containing a number of transmembrane and accessory proteins including PDZ scaffolds such as NHERF1 and NHERF2. PDZ scaffold proteins bind to class I PDZ binding motifs (S/T-X-Φ) in the extreme C-terminus of targets. Megalin contains a functional PDZ binding motif (SDV) in its distal terminus, however a potential interaction with the NHERF proteins has not been investigated. As megalin associates with NHE3 in the microvilli and NHE3 is tethered to the intravillar cleft via its interaction with NHERF1, we investigated if there is a direct interaction between megalin and NHERF1 in renal proximal tubule cells. Using confocal microscopy we determined that megalin and NHERF1 co-localise in the apical region in proximal tubule cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed using rat kidney lysate indicated that megalin bound NHERF1 in vivo. Using fusion proteins and peptides, we determined that PDZ2 of NHERF1 bound to megalin and that this interaction was via the C-terminus of megalin directly and in the absence of any accessory protein. We next investigated which domain in megalin was regulating this interaction. Using GST fusion proteins we determined that the loss of the most distal C-terminus of megalin containing the PDZ binding motif (SDV) did not alter its ability to bind to NHERF1. Significantly, we then identified an internal NHERF binding domain in the C-terminus of megalin. Using peptide studies we were able to demonstrate that NHERF1 bound to an internal PDZ binding motif in megalin and that a loss of a single threonine residue abolished the interaction between megalin and NHERF1. Finally, in proximal tubule cells, silencing NHERF1 increased megalin expression. Therefore, we have identified a novel protein interaction in proximal tubule cells and specifically identified a new internal PDZ binding motif in the C-terminus of megalin.

18387945|t|Identification and functional analysis of phosphorylated tyrosine residues within EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase.
18387945|t|EphA2 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphA2 mediates cell-cell communication and plays critical roles in a number of physiological and pathologic responses. We have previously shown that EphA2 is a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis and that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates EphA2 signaling. To understand the role of EphA2 phosphorylation, we have mapped phosphorylated tyrosines within the intracellular region of EphA2 by a combination of mass spectrometry analysis and phosphopeptide mapping using two-dimensional chromatography in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis. The function of these phosphorylated tyrosine residues was assessed by mutational analysis using EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with EphA2 tyrosine-to-phenylalanine or tyrosine-to-glutamic acid substitution mutants. Phosphorylated Tyr(587) and Tyr(593) bind to Vav2 and Vav3 guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas Tyr(P)(734) binds to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Mutations that uncouple EphA2 with Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors or p85 are defective in Rac1 activation and cell migration. Finally, EphA2 mutations in the juxtamembrane region (Y587F, Y593F, Y587E/Y593E), kinase domain (Y734F), or SAM domain (Y929F) inhibited ephrin-A1-induced vascular assembly. In addition, EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with these mutants were unable to incorporate into tumor vasculature, suggesting a critical role of these phosphorylation tyrosine residues in transducing EphA2 signaling in vascular endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis.

24334288|t|Catalytic domain surface residues mediating catecholamine inhibition in tyrosine hydroxylase.
24334288|t|Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) performs the rate-limiting step in catecholamine (CA) synthesis and is a tetramer composed of regulatory, catalytic and tetramerization domains. CAs inhibit TH by binding two sites in the active site; one with high affinity and one with low affinity. Only high affinity CA binding requires the regulatory domain, believed to interact with the catalytic domain in the presence of CA. Without a crystal structure of the regulatory domain, the specific areas involved in this process are largely undefined. It is not clear whether the regulatory domain-catalytic domain interaction is asymmetrical across the tetramer to produce the high and low affinity sites. To investigate this, pure dimeric TH was generated through double substitution of residues at the tetramerization interface and dimerization salt bridge (K170E/L480A). This was shown to be the core regulatory unit of TH for CA inhibition, possessing both high and low affinity CA binding sites, indicating that there is symmetry between dimers of the tetramer. We also examined possible regulatory domain-interacting regions on the catalytic domain that mediate high affinity CA binding. Using site-directed mutagenesis, A297, E362/E365 and S368 were shown to mediate high affinity dopamine inhibition through V(max) reduction and increasing the K(M) for the cofactor.

8810259|t|Calmodulin binds to and inhibits GTP binding of the ras-like GTPase Kir/Gem.
8810259|t|Recently, a new subfamily of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins consisting of Rad (Ras associated with diabetes), Gem (immediate early gene expressed in mitogen-stimulated T-cells), and Kir (tyrosine kinase-inducible Ras-like) was discovered. The C terminus of these proteins contains an extension of approximately 30 amino acids not present in other members of the Ras family and which exhibits all the hallmarks typical for calmodulin (CaM)-binding domains. A peptide corresponding to the putative CaM-binding domain of the Kir/Gem protein was synthesized, and its affinity for CaM was determined by fluorescence spectrometry. Titration of dansyl-CaM with the Kir/Gem peptide gave an affinity constant of 1 nM. Furthermore, a single point mutation of the peptide, W269G, abolished this high affinity interaction. Gel-shift analysis showed that the complex formation between CaM and the Kir/Gem peptide is strictly calcium-dependent. We also demonstrate with a newly developed [32P]CaM overlay technique that full-length Kir/Gem and Rad proteins bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. The binding of CaM to glutathione S-transferase-Kir and GST-Gem inhibited the binding of GTP to Kir/Gem significantly. These results suggest the existence of a direct link between Ca2+/CaM and growth factor signal transduction pathways at the level of small Ras-like GTPases.

9126929|t|Identification of amino acid residues important for ligand binding to Fas.
9126929|t|The interaction of Fas (CD95), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, and its ligand (FasL) triggers programmed cell death (apoptosis) and is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Although the Fas-FasL interaction is conserved across species barriers, little is currently known about the molecular details of this interaction. Our aim was to identify residues in Fas that are important for ligand binding. With the aid of a Fas molecular model, candidate amino acid residues were selected in the Fas extracellular domain 2 (D2) and D3 and subjected to serine-scanning mutagenesis to produce mutant Fas molecules in the form of Ig fusion proteins. The effects of these mutations on FasL binding was examined by measuring the ability of these proteins to inhibit FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells and bind FasL in ELISA and BIAcore assays. Mutation of two amino acids, R86 and R87 (D2), to serine totally abolished the ability of Fas to interact with its ligand, whereas mutants K84S, L90S, E93S (D2), or H126S (D3) showed reduced binding compared with wild-type Fas. Two mutants (K78S and H95S) bound FasL comparably to wild type. Therefore, the binding of FasL involves residues in two domains that correspond to positions critical for ligand binding in other family members (TNFR and CD40) but are conserved between murine and human Fas.

15579463|t|Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr-157 interferes with its association with importin alpha during G1 and prevents nuclear re-entry.
15579463|t|We have studied mechanisms of Akt-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of cellular localization of p27. Akt phosphorylates Thr-157 in p27 and retains it in the cytosol. In cells arrested in G(1) and then synchronized to enter into S phase, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-157 p27 occurred in the cytosol during G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Both T157A and S10A p27 mutants localized in the nucleus in all phases of the cell cycle regardless of the expression of active Akt. Thr-157 phosphorylation was undetectable in S10A-p27, suggesting that Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for p27 localization in the cytosol and subsequent phosphorylation at Thr-157. Phosphorylation at Thr-157 interrupted the association of p27 with importin alpha. A T157A-p27 mutant protein exhibited higher association with importin alpha than wild-type-p27. Treatment of transfected and endogenous p27 with alkaline phosphatase rescued its association with importin alpha. Leptomycin B inhibited cytosolic Thr-157 P-p27 staining, implying that CRM1-dependent nuclear export is required for Akt-mediated Thr-157 phosphorylation. Heterokaryon shuttling assays with NIH3T3 (mouse) cells transfected with FLAG-p27 and HeLa (human) cells revealed that both wild type and T157A-p27 shuttled from NIH3T3 to HeLa cell nuclei with similar frequencies. However, S10A-p27 was found only in the NIH3T3 nuclei of NIH3T3-HeLa cell fusions. These results suggest that 1) Ser-10 phosphorylation is required for nuclear export of p27, 2) subsequent Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-157 during G(1) phase corrals p27 in the cytosol, and 3) Thr-157 phosphorylation inhibits the association of p27 with importin alpha thus preventing its re-entry into the nucleus.

12682072|t|Functional interactions between the estrogen receptor coactivator PELP1/MNAR and retinoblastoma protein.
12682072|t|PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein-1 (also referred to as MNAR, or modulator of nongenomic activity of estrogen receptor)), a recently identified novel coactivator of estrogen receptors, is widely expressed in a variety of 17 beta-estradiol (E2)-responsive reproductive tissues and is developmentally regulated in mammary glands. pRb (retinoblastoma protein), a cell cycle switch protein, plays a fundamental role in the proliferation, development, and differentiation of eukaryotic cells. To study the putative function of PELP1, we established stable MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines overexpressing PELP1. PELP1 overexpression hypersensitized breast cancer cells to E2 signaling, enhanced progression of breast cancer cells to S phase, and led to persistent hyperphosphorylation of pRb in an E2-dependent manner. Using phosphorylation site-specific pRb antibodies, we identified Ser-807/Ser-811 of pRb as a potential target site of PELP1. Interestingly, PELP1 was discovered to be physiologically associated with pRb and interacted via its C-terminal pocket domain, and PELP1/pRb interaction could be modulated by antiestrogen agents. Using mutant pRb cells, we demonstrated an essential role for PELP1/pRb interactions in the maximal coactivation functions of PELP1 using cyclin D1 as one of the targets. Taken together, these findings suggest that PELP1, a steroid coactivator, plays a permissive role in E2-mediated cell cycle progression, presumably via its regulatory interaction with the pRb pathway.

11520784|t|Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase contributes to the transformation of hematopoietic cells by the D816V c-Kit mutant.
11520784|t|Stem cell factor (SCF) binds the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit and is critical for normal hematopoiesis. Substitution of valine for aspartic acid 816 (D816V) constitutively actives human c-Kit, and this mutation is found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Immortalized murine progenitor cells (MIHCs) transduced with wild-type c-Kit proliferate in response to SCF, whereas cells expressing D816V c-Kit (MIHC-D816V) are factor-independent and tumorigenic. However, the mechanisms mediating transformation by D816V c-Kit are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify signaling components that contribute to D816V c-Kit-mediated transformation. SCF stimulates association of p85PI3K with phosphorylated tyrosine 721 of wild-type c-Kit. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) subsequently contributes to the activation of Akt and Jnks. In contrast, these studies demonstrated that the D816V c-Kit mutant was constitutively associated with phosphorylated p85PI3K, and, downstream of PI3K, Jnk 1 and Jnk 2 were activated but Akt was not. Interestingly, Erks 1 and 2 were not constitutively activated by D816V c-Kit. Thus, D816V c-Kit maintains the activity of PI3K but not of all signaling pathways activated by wild-type c-Kit. Further, all pathways downstream of PI3K are not constitutively active in MIHC-D816V cells. Studies with a PI3K inhibitor and D816V/Y721F c-Kit, a mutant incapable of recruiting PI3K, indicate that constitutive activation of PI3K through direct recruitment by D816V c-Kit plays a role in factor-independent growth of MIHC and is critical for tumorigenicity.

19913028|t|Folding of tetrameric p53: oligomerization and tumorigenic mutations induce misfolding and loss of function.
19913028|t|The physiologically active form of p53 consists of a tetramer of four identical 393-amino-acid subunits associated via their tetramerization domains (TDs; residues 325-355). One in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 (residues 94-312). Most existing studies on the effects of these mutations on p53 structure and function have been carried out on the isolated DBD fragment, which is monomeric. Recent structural evidence, however, suggests that DBDs may interact with each other in full-length tetrameric forms of p53. Here, we investigate the effects of tumorigenic DBD mutations on the folding of p53 in its tetrameric form. We employ the construct consisting of DBD and TD (amino acids 94-360). We characterize the stability and conformational state of the tumorigenic DBD mutants R248Q, R249S, and R282Q using equilibrium denaturation and functional assays. Destabilizing mutations cause DBD to misfold when it is part of the p53 tetramer, but not when it is monomeric. This conformation is populated under moderately destabilizing conditions (10 degrees C in 2 M urea, and at physiological temperature in the absence of denaturant). Under those same conditions, it is not present in the isolated DBD fragment or in the presence of the TD mutation L344P, which abolishes tetramerization. Misfolding appears to involve intramolecular DBD-DBD association within a single tetrameric molecule. This association is promoted by destabilization of DBD (caused by mutation or elevated temperature) and by the high local DBD concentration enforced by tetramerization of TD. Disrupting the nonnative DBD-DBD interaction or transiently inhibiting tetramerization and allowing p53 to fold as a monomer may be potential strategies for pharmacological intervention in cancer.

15865443|t|Hierarchical phosphorylation of the TNF-alpha receptor, TNF-R1, by p42Mapk/Erk at basic Pro-directed kinase sites.
15865443|t|Phosphorylation of the TNF-alpha receptor TNF-R1 has been shown to differentially regulate receptor signaling and function and promote changes in its subcellular localization. Previous studies have shown that p42(mapk/erk2) phosphorylates Ser and Thr residues (T236, S240, S244, and S270) in the membrane proximal region of TNF-R1 and that mutation of these residues to Glu and Asp residues (TNF-R1.4D/E) mimics the effect of phosphorylation on receptor signaling and localization. In the present study, we investigated whether the initial phosphorylation of these residues by p42(mapk/erk2) promotes hierarchical phosphorylation of additional sites within the cytoplasmic domain of TNF-R1. This question was addressed by investigating the ability of the TNF-R1.4D/E mutant receptor to be phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assays using GST-mutant cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins as substrates and in intact cells following mutant receptor expression. In addition, we determined the location of the additional phosphorylation sites. Incubation of Sepharose bead-bound GST-TNF-R1(207)(-)(425).4D/E fusion protein with lysates containing activated p42(mapk/erk2) led to the phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in addition to the previously defined sites at T236, S240, S244, and S270. Deletional mutagenesis localized these residues to a stretch of 14 amino acids that encompasses three basic Pro-directed ([S/T]P) kinase consensus sequences located between residues S256 and T267. Point mutagenesis of T257, S262, and T267 to Ala residues indicated that these sites are targets of phosphorylation by p42(mapk/)(erk2). These findings support the conclusion that p42(mapk/erk2) promotes extensive phosphorylation of the membrane proximal region in a hierarchical fashion at both consensus and nonconsensus ERK-phosphorylation sites.

12021405|t|Molecular basis of the selectivity of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor for gastrin-releasing peptide.
12021405|t|The mammalian bombesin peptides [gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB)] are important in numerous biological and pathological processes. These effects are mediated by the heptahelical GRP receptor (GRPR) and NMB receptor (NMBR). GRP has high affinity for GRPR and lower affinity for NMBR. Almost nothing is known about the molecular basis for the selectivity of GRP. To address this question, we first studied four loss-of-affinity GRPR chimeric receptors formed by exchanging the four extracellular (EC) domains of GRPR with the corresponding NMBR EC domains. Receptors were transiently expressed, and affinities were determined by binding studies. Only substitution of the third EC domain (EC3) of GRPR markedly decreased GRP affinity. In the reverse study using gain-of-affinity NMBR chimeras, only replacement of EC3 of NMBR markedly increased GRP affinity. Replacing each of the 20 comparable EC3 amino acids that differed in the NMBR in GRPR showed that two separate NMBR substitutions in the GRPR, Ile for Phe(185) or Ile for Ala(198), markedly decreased GRP affinity. Additional point mutants demonstrated that an amino acid with an aromatic ring in position 185 of GRPR and the size of the backbone substitution in position 198 of GRPR were important for GRP selectivity. These results demonstrate that selectivity of GRP for GRPR over NMBR is primarily determined by two amino acid differences in the EC3 domains of the receptor. Our results suggest that an interaction between the aromatic ring of Phe(185) of the GRPR with GRP is the most important for GRP selectivity.

11877416|t|Identification of a substrate recognition site on Ubc9.
11877416|t|Human Ubc9 is homologous to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. However, instead of conjugating ubiquitin, it conjugates a ubiquitin homologue, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1), also known as UBL1, GMP1, SMTP3, PIC1, and sentrin. The SUMO-1 conjugation pathway is very similar to that of ubiquitin with regard to the primary sequences of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), the three-dimensional structures of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and the chemistry of the overall conjugation pathway. The interaction of substrates with Ubc9 has been studied using NMR spectroscopy. Peptides with sequences that correspond to those of the SUMO-1 conjugation sites from p53 and c-Jun both bind to a surface adjacent to the active site Cys93 of human Ubc9, which has been previously shown to include residues that demonstrate the most significant dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Mutations in this region, Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A, were constructed to evaluate the role of these residues in SUMO-1 conjugation. These alterations have significant effects on the conjugation of SUMO-1 with the target proteins p53, E1B, and promyelocytic leukemia protein and define a substrate binding site on Ubc9. Furthermore, the SUMO-1 conjugation site of p53 does not form any defined secondary structure when either free or bound to Ubc9. This suggests that a defined secondary structure at SUMO-1 conjugation sites in target proteins is not necessary for recognition and conjugation by the SUMO-1 pathway.

17361990|t|Peptide probe study of the role of interaction between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the ryanodine receptor in the channel regulation mechanism.
17361990|t|Ryanodine receptor (RyR) mutations linked with some congenital skeletal and cardiac diseases are localized to three easily definable regions: region 1 (N-terminal domain), region 2 (central domain), and a rather broad region 3 containing the channel pore. As shown in our recent studies, the interdomain interaction between regions 1 and 2 plays a critical role in channel regulation and pathogenesis. Here we present evidence that within region 3 there is a similar channel regulation mechanism mediated by an interdomain interaction. DP15, a peptide corresponding to RyR1 residues 4820-4841, produced significant activation of [3H]ryanodine binding above threshold Ca2+ concentrations (>or=0.3 microM), but MH mutations (L4823P or L4837V) made in DP15 almost completely abolished its channel activating function. To identify the DP15 binding site(s) within RyR1, DP15 (labeled with a fluorescent probe Alexa Fluor 680 and a photoaffinity cross-linker APG) was cross-linked to RyR1, and the site of cross-linking was identified by gel analysis of fluorescently labeled proteolytic fragments with the aid of Western blotting with site-specific antibodies. The shortest fluorescently labeled band was a 96 kDa fragment which was stained with an antibody directed to the region of residues 4114-4142 of RyR1, indicating that the interaction between the region of residues 4820-4841 adjacent to the channel pore and the 96 kDa segment containing the region of residues 4114-4142 is involved in the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent channel regulation. In further support of this concept, anti-DP15 antibody and cardiac counterpart of DP15 produced channel activation similar to that of DP15.

16545942|t|Role of the conserved NPxxY motif of the 5-HT2A receptor in determining selective interaction with isoforms of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF).
16545942|t|In this study we have shown that N376 to D mutation in the conserved NPxxY motif within the carboxy terminal tail domain (CT) of the 5-HT2A receptor alters the binding preference of GST-fusion protein constructs of the CT domain from ARF1 to an alternative isoform, ARF6. These findings were corroborated by experiments investigating co-immunoprecipitation of the wild type (WT) and N376D mutant of the 5-HT2A receptor with ARF1 or 6 or dominant negative ARF1/6 constructs co-expressed in COS7 cells. In functional assays of 5-HT-induced phospholipase D (PLD) activation responses of the WT receptor were inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of ARF1 but not ARF6, whereas responses of the N376D mutant were strongly inhibited by negative mutant ARF6. No equivalent effect of the ARF mutants was seen on phospholipase C activation. In experiments assaying 5-HT-induced increases in [35S]GTPgammaS binding to ARF 1/6 immunoprecipitates as a measure of ARF activation, increased ARF6 activation was seen only with the mutant receptor. When cellular PLD responses of other NPxxY- or a DPxxY-containing GPCRs were measured in the presence of dominant negative ARF1/6 constructs, the majority, but not all, fitted the pattern exemplified by the 5-HT2A receptor and its N376D mutant. These data suggest that the presence of the N or a D in this highly conserved motif is an important, but not exclusive, determinant of which ARF isoform interacts with the GPCR.

7678409|t|Direct analysis of the binding of the abl Src homology 2 domain to the activated epidermal growth factor receptor.
7678409|t|Src homology regions 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) are noncatalytic domains that are conserved among several proteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation. Using bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of the abl tyrosine kinase, we have quantitated the binding of these domains to the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). A 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein binds to the human EGFR immunoprecipitated from EGF-treated NIH3T3 cells that overexpress the receptor. This binding is totally dependent on the pretreatment of cells with EGF. The interaction is rapid, reaching 50% of maximum within 1 min, and attaining apparent equilibrium by 10 min. Dissociation of the complex is biphasic with a rapidly dissociating component (t1/2 of less than 1 min), as well as a slowly dissociable component. The 35S-labeled abl SH2 fusion protein specifically binds to the EGFR in a saturable manner and is differentially inhibited by unlabeled fusion proteins containing SH2 domains from phospholipase C, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the GTPase activation protein of ras. To identify residues critical for abl SH2-EGFR binding, six point mutants were constructed in the highly conserved FLVRES motif. Three mutants (V170L, E172Q, and E174Q) display binding affinities similar to that of wild type. However, three other mutants (R171K, S173C, and S175C) have greatly reduced affinity. Interestingly, the binding affinity to the EGFR determined by the in vitro assay directly correlates with the transforming ability of the corresponding v-abl constructs in vivo (Mayer, B. J., Jackson, P. K., Etten, R. A. V., and Baltimore, D. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 609-618). These data indicate that the Arg-171, Ser-173, and Ser-175 are critical for both transformation and abl SH2 domain binding to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins.

10358085|t|Divalent cations differentially regulate integrin alphaIIb cytoplasmic tail binding to beta3 and to calcium- and integrin-binding protein.
10358085|t|We have used recombinant or synthetic alphaIIb and beta3 integrin cytoplasmic peptides to study their in vitro complexation and ligand binding capacity by surface plasmon resonance. alpha.beta heterodimerization occurred in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a weak KD in the micromolar range. Divalent cations were not required for this association but stabilized the alpha.beta complex by decreasing the dissociation rate. alpha.beta complexation was impaired by the R995A substitution or the KVGFFKR deletion in alphaIIb but not by the beta3 S752P mutation. Recombinant calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), an alphaIIb-specific ligand, bound to the alphaIIb cytoplasmic peptide in a Ca2+- or Mn2+-independent, one-to-one reaction with a KD value of 12 microM. In contrast, in vitro liquid phase binding of CIB to intact alphaIIbbeta3 occurred preferentially with Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3 conformers, as demonstrated by enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of CIB with PAC-1-captured Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that Mn2+ activation of intact alphaIIbbeta3 induces the exposure of a CIB-binding site, spontaneously exposed by the free alphaIIb peptide. Since CIB did not stimulate PAC-1 binding to inactive alphaIIbbeta3 nor prevented activated alphaIIbbeta3 occupancy by PAC-1, we conclude that CIB does not regulate alphaIIbbeta3 inside-out signaling, but rather is involved in an alphaIIbbeta3 post-receptor occupancy event.

16679305|t|K-ras Asp12 mutant neither interacts with Raf, nor signals through Erk and is less tumorigenic than K-ras Val12.
16679305|t|Different mutant amino acids in the Ras proteins lead to distinct transforming capacities and different aggressiveness in human tumors. K-Ras Asp12 (K12D) is more prevalent in benign than in malignant human colorectal tumors, whereas K-Ras Val12 (K12V) associates with more advanced and metastatic carcinomas, higher recurrence and decreased survival. Here, we tested, in a nude mouse xenograft model, whether different human K-Ras oncogenes mutated at codon 12 to Val, Asp or Cys would confer NIH3T3 fibroblasts distinct oncogenic phenotypes. We studied tumor histology and growth, apoptotic and mitotic rates, activation of signal transduction pathways downstream of Ras and regulation of the cell cycle and apoptotic proteins in tumors derived from the implanted transformants. We found that the K12V oncogene induces a more aggressive tumorigenic phenotype than the K12D oncogene, whereas K12C does not induce tumors in this model. Thus, K12V mutant tumors proliferate about seven times faster, and have higher cellularity and mitotic rates than the K12D mutant tumors. A molecular analysis of the induced tumors shows that the K12V mutant protein interacts with Raf-1 and transduces signals mainly through the Erk pathway. Unexpectedly, in tumors induced by the K12D oncogene, the K-Ras mutant protein does not interact with Raf-1 nor activates the Erk canonical pathway. Instead, it transduces signals through the PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 and FAK pathways. Finally, the higher growth rate of the K12V tumors associates with enhanced Rb phosphorylation, and PCNA and cyclin B upregulation, consistent with faster G1/S and G2/M transitions, without alteration of apoptotic regulation.

7629119|t|Association of native Ca2+ channel beta subunits with the alpha 1 subunit interaction domain.
7629119|t|beta Subunits of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels play an important role in regulating Ca2+ channel function. The sites of alpha 1-beta subunit interaction have been localized recently to cytoplasmic domains of both subunits. The alpha 1 subunit interaction domain (AID) is an 18-amino-acid conserved motif located between repeats I and II on all alpha 1 subunits which is essential for the binding of beta subunits. In order to further study the interaction of beta subunits with AID, we have expressed a 50-amino-acid glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein from the alpha 1A subunit that contains the AID. Mutant GST fusion proteins that contain a single amino acid change (Y392S, Y392F, and Y392W) in the AIDA along with control GST were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to form affinity beads. Binding assays using these affinity beads with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled beta 2 and beta 3 subunits demonstrate that the hydroxyl group on tyrosine 392 of AIDA is critical for binding to beta subunits. The affinity bead assay was also used to identify and characterize native beta subunits from detergent extracts of different tissues. The AIDA affinity beads, but not the control or Y392S beads, specifically bind beta subunits from detergent extracts of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. Immunoblot analyses demonstrate the presence of beta 1a in skeletal muscle, beta 2 and beta 3 in cardiac muscle, and beta 1b, beta 3, and beta 4 in brain. The assays also demonstrate the AIDA beads bind to beta subunits from tissue homogenates extracted with low salt and no detergent suggesting the existence of a pool of beta subunits which is not always associated with alpha 1 subunits. Also, beta subunits from solubilized skeletal muscle triads can be affinity-purified using AIDA CNBr-Sepharose. Our data demonstrate that the AID binds to native beta subunits from detergent and non-detergent tissue extracts illustrating that this domain on the alpha 1 subunit is the major anchoring site for the beta subunit.

12122014|t|Csk homologous kinase (CHK) and ErbB-2 interactions are directly coupled with CHK negative growth regulatory function in breast cancer.
12122014|t|Our previous studies demonstrated that Csk homologous kinase (CHK) acts as a negative growth regulator of human breast cancer through inhibition of ErbB-2/neu-mediated Src family kinase activity (Bougeret, C., Jiang, S., Keydar, I., and Avraham, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 33711-33720. The interaction between the CHK SH2 domain and Tyr(P)(1248) of the ErbB-2 receptor has been shown to be specific and critical for CHK function. In this report, we investigated whether the interaction of the CHK SH2 domain and ErbB-2 is directly related to the inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity. We constructed three CHK SH2 domain binding mutants: G129R (enhanced binding), R147K (inhibited binding), and R147A (disrupted binding). NMR spectra for the domains of each construct were used to evaluate their interaction with a Tyr(P)(1248)-containing ErbB-2 peptide. G129R showed enhanced binding to ErbB-2, whereas binding was completely disrupted by R147A. The enhanced binding mutant showed chemical shift changes at the same residues as wild-type CHK, indicating that this mutant has the same binding characteristics as the wild-type protein. Furthermore, inhibition of heregulin-stimulated Src kinase activity was markedly diminished by R147A, whereas G129R-mediated inhibition was stronger as compared with wild-type CHK. These results indicate that the specific interaction of CHK and ErbB-2 via the SH2 domain of CHK is directly related to the growth inhibitory effects of CHK. These new CHK high affinity binding constructs may serve as good candidates for inhibition of the ErbB-2/Src transduction pathway in gene therapy studies in breast cancer.

20843805|t|Down-regulation of intestinal apical calcium entry channel TRPV6 by ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4-2.
20843805|t|Nedd4-2 is an archetypal HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase that disposes target proteins for degradation. Because of the proven roles of Nedd4-2 in degradation of membrane proteins, such as epithelial Na(+) channel, we examined the effect of Nedd4-2 on the apical Ca(2+) channel TRPV6, which is involved in transcellular Ca(2+) transport in the intestine using the Xenopus laevis oocyte system. We demonstrated that a significant amount of Nedd4-2 protein was distributed to the absorptive epithelial cells in ileum, cecum, and colon along with TRPV6. When co-expressed in oocytes, Nedd4-2 and, to a lesser extent, Nedd4 down-regulated the protein abundance and Ca(2+) influx of TRPV6 and TRPV5, respectively. TRPV6 ubiquitination was increased, and its stability was decreased by Nedd4-2. The Nedd4-2 inhibitory effects on TRPV6 were partially blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine. The rate of TRPV6 internalization was not significantly altered by Nedd4-2. The HECT domain was essential to the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on TRPV6 and to their association. The WW1 and WW2 domains interacted with TRPV6 terminal regions, and a disruption of the interactions by D204H and D376H mutations in the WW1 and WW2 domains increased TRPV6 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, WW1 and WW2 may serve as a molecular switch to limit the ubiquitination of TRPV6 by the HECT domain. In conclusion, Nedd4-2 may regulate TRPV6 protein abundance in intestinal epithelia by controlling TRPV6 ubiquitination.

14506284|t|Epidermal growth factor-dependent regulation of Cdc42 is mediated by the Src tyrosine kinase.
14506284|t|Treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) promotes the activation of the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42, as well as its phosphorylation in cells. The EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc42 occurs at tyrosine 64 in the Switch II domain and appears to be mediated through the Src tyrosine kinase, because both the expression of a dominant-negative Src mutant (mouse Src(K297R)) and treatment of cells with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 blocks the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42, whereas expression of an activated Src mutant (Src(Y529F)) promotes phosphorylation in the absence of EGF treatment. The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is not required for its activation, nor does it directly affect the interactions of activated Cdc42 with target/effector proteins including PAK, ACK, WASP, or IQGAP. However, the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc42 is accompanied by an enhancement in the interaction of Cdc42 with the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). The EGF-stimulated activation of Cdc42 does require activated Src, as well as the Vav2 protein, a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Src catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2, and overexpression of Vav2 together with activated Src (Src(Y529F)) can completely bypass the need for EGF to promote the activation of Cdc42. Thus, EGF signaling through Src appears to have dual regulatory effects on Cdc42: 1). it leads to the activation of Cdc42 as mediated by the Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and 2). it results in the phosphorylation of Cdc42, which stimulates the binding of RhoGDI, perhaps to direct the movement of Cdc42 to a specific cellular site to trigger a signaling response, because Cdc42-RhoGDI interactions are essential for Cdc42-induced cellular transformation.

8764048|t|Importance of the Ser-132 phosphorylation site in cell transformation and apoptosis induced by the adenovirus type 5 E1A protein.
8764048|t|The 289-residue (289R) and 243R early region 1A (E1A) proteins of human adenovirus type 5 induce cell transformation in cooperation with either E1B or activated ras. Here we report that Ser-132 in both E1A products is a site of phosphorylation in vivo and is the only site phosphorylated in vitro by purified casein kinase II. Ser-132 is located in conserved region 2 near the primary binding site for the pRB tumor suppressor and, in 289R, just upstream of the conserved region 3 transactivation domain involved in regulation of early viral gene expression. Mutants containing alanine or glycine in place of Ser-132 interacted with pRB-related proteins at somewhat reduced efficiency; however, all Ser-132 mutants transformed primary rat cells in cooperation with E1B as well as or better than the wild type when both major E1A proteins were expressed. Such was not the case with mutants expressing only 289R. In cooperation with E1B, the Asp-132 and Gly-132 mutants yielded reduced numbers of smaller transformed foci. With activated ras, all Ser-132 mutants were significantly defective for transformation and the rare foci produced were small and contained extensive areas populated by low densities of flat cells. In the absence of E1B, all Ser-132 mutants induced p53-independent cell death more readily than virus expressing wild-type 289R. These results suggested that phosphorylation at Ser-132 may enhance the binding of pRB and related proteins and also reduce the toxicity of E1A 289R, thus increasing transforming activity.

15297464|t|A juxtamembrane tyrosine in the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor regulates ligand-induced Src association, receptor kinase function, and down-regulation.
15297464|t|Recent literature implicates a regulatory function of the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) in receptor tyrosine kinases. Mutations in the JMD of c-Kit and Flt3 are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and acute myeloid leukemias, respectively. Additionally, autophosphorylated Tyr559 in the JMD of the colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-1R) binds to Src family kinases (SFKs). To investigate SFK function in CSF-1 signaling we established stable 32D myeloid cell lines expressing CSF-1Rs with mutated SFK binding sites (Tyr559-TFI). Whereas binding to I562S was not significantly perturbed, Y559F and Y559D exhibited markedly decreased CSF-1-dependent SFK association. All JMD mutants retained intrinsic kinase activity, but Y559F, and less so Y559D, showed dramatically reduced CSF-1-induced autophosphorylation. CSF-1-mediated wild-type (WT)-CSF-1R phosphorylation was not markedly affected by SFK inhibition, indicating that lack of SFK binding is not responsible for diminished Y559F phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, cells expressing Y559F were hyperproliferative in response to CSF-1. Hyperproliferation correlated with prolonged activation of Akt, ERK, and Stat5 in the Y559F mutant. Consistent with a defect in receptor negative regulation, c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation and CSF-1R/c-Cbl co-association were almost undetectable in the Y559F mutant. Furthermore, Y559F underwent reduced multiubiquitination and delayed receptor internalization and degradation. In conclusion, we propose that Tyr559 is a switch residue that functions in kinase regulation, signal transduction and, indirectly, receptor down-regulation. These findings may have implications for the oncogenic conversion of c-Kit and Flt3 with JMD mutations.

11809791|t|Role for the adaptor protein Grb10 in the activation of Akt.
11809791|t|Grb10 is a member of the Grb7 family of adapter proteins lacking intrinsic enzymatic function and encodes functional domains including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and an SH2 domain. The role of different Grb10 splice variants in signal transduction of growth factors like insulin or insulin-like growth factor has been described as inhibitory or stimulatory depending on the presence of a functional PH and/or SH2 domain. Performing a yeast two-hybrid screen with the c-kit cytoplasmic tail fused to LexA as a bait and a mouse embryo cDNA library as prey, we found that the Grb10 SH2 domain interacted with the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase. In the course of SCF-mediated activation of c-kit, Grb10 is recruited to the c-kit receptor in an SH2 domain- and phosphotyrosine-dependent but PH domain-independent manner. We found that Akt and Grb10 form a constitutive complex, suggesting a role for Grb10 in the translocation of Akt to the cell membrane. Indeed, coexpression studies revealed that Grb10 and c-kit activate Akt in a synergistic manner. This dose-dependent effect of Grb10 is wortmannin sensitive and was also seen at a lower level in cells in which c-kit was not expressed. Expression of a Grb10 mutant lacking the SH2 domain as well as a mutant lacking the PH domain did not influence Akt activity. Grb10-induced Akt activation was observed without increased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity, suggesting that Grb10 is a positive regulator of Akt downstream of PI3-kinase. Significantly, deficient activation of Akt by a constitutively activated c-kit mutant lacking the binding site for PI3-kinase (c-kitD814V/Y719F) could be fully compensated by overexpression of Grb10. In Ba/F3 cells, the incapacity of c-kitD814V/Y719F to induce interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth could be rescued by overexpression of Grb10. In contrast, expression of the SH2 deletion mutant of Grb10 together with c-kitD814V/Y719F did not render Ba/F3 cells independent of IL-3. In summary, we provide evidence that Grb10 is part of the c-kit signaling pathway and that the expression level of Grb10 critically influences Akt activity. We propose a model in which Grb10 acts as a coactivator for Akt by virtue of its ability to form a complex with Akt and its SH2 domain-dependent translocation to the cell membrane.

17884818|t|Transforming growth factor-beta regulates DNA binding activity of transcription factor Fli1 by p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor-dependent acetylation.
17884818|t|Fli1, a member of Ets transcriptional factors, has been shown to be a negative regulator of collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. Although Fli1 down-regulation is implicated in pathological matrix remodeling such as cutaneous fibrosis in scleroderma, very little is known about the post-translational mechanisms regulating Fli1 function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of acetylation, one of the main post-translational regulatory mechanisms, in regulating Fli1 activity. We initially demonstrated that Fli1 is acetylated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in dermal fibroblasts. An in vivo acetylation assay using 293T cells revealed that Fli1 is mainly acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) at lysine 380. Acetylation of Fli1 resulted in a decreased stability of Fli1 protein. More importantly, reduced binding of acetylated Fli1 to the human alpha2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter was observed in DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Conversely, a Fli1 K380R mutant that is resistant to acetylation by PCAF showed increased DNA binding ability. Furthermore, PCAF overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of Fli1 on TGF-beta1-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity. In contrast, the Fli1 K380R mutant had a greater inhibitory effect on TGF-beta1-induced COL1A2 promoter activity than wild-type Fli1, and PCAF failed to reverse this effect. These results indicate that PCAF-dependent acetylation of lysine 380 abrogates repressor function of Fli1 with respect to collagen gene expression. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that the TGF-beta-dependent acetylation of Fli1 may represent the principal mechanism responsible for the TGF-beta-induced dissociation of Fli1 from the collagen promoter.

17369112|t|Tissue-specific interactions of TNI isoforms with other TN subunits and tropomyosins in C. elegans: the role of the C- and N-terminal extensions.
17369112|t|The aim of this study is to investigate the function of the C-terminal extension of three troponin I isoforms, that are unique to the body wall muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans and to understand the molecular interactions within the TN complex between troponin I with troponin C/T, and tropomyosin. We constructed several expression vectors to generate recombinant proteins of three body wall and one pharyngeal troponin I isoforms in Escherichia coli. Protein overlay assays and Western blot analyses were performed using antibodies. We demonstrated that pharyngeal TNI-4 interacted with only the pharyngeal isoforms of troponin C/T and tropomyosin. In contrast, the body wall TNI-2 bound both the body wall and pharyngeal isoforms of these components. Similar to other invertebrates, the N-terminus of troponin I contributes to interactions with troponin C. Full-length troponin I was essential for interactions with tropomyosin isoforms. Deletion of the C-terminal extension had no direct effect on the binding of the body wall troponin I to other muscle thin filament troponin C/T and tropomyosin isoforms.

16738310|t|Bcl2's flexible loop domain regulates p53 binding and survival.
16738310|t|p53 not only functions as a transcription factor but also has a direct, apoptogenic role at the mitochondria. We have discovered that DNA damage-induced p53-Bcl2 binding is associated with decreased Bcl2-Bax interaction and increased apoptotic cell death in a mechanism regulated by Bcl2's flexible loop regulatory domain (FLD), since purified p53 protein can disrupt the Bcl2/Bax complex by directly binding to a negative regulatory region of the FLD (amino acids [aa] 32 to 68). Deletion of the negative regulatory region (Delta32-68) abolishes Bcl2-p53 binding and enhances Bcl2's antiapoptotic function. Conversely, removal of a positive regulatory region (aa 69 to 87) of the FLD, which contains the Bcl2 phosphorylation site(s) T69, S70, and S87, enhances Bcl2-p53 binding and significantly abrogates Bcl2's survival activity. The phospho-mimetic T69E/S70E/S87E (EEE) but not the nonphosphorylatable T69A/S70A/S87A (AAA) Bcl2 mutant displays a reduced capacity to bind p53 and potently inhibits p53-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Furthermore, the FLD-only aa32-87 and aa32-68 peptides but not the aa69-87 peptide can directly bind p53 in vitro. p53-induced cytochrome c release occurs through a mechanism involving Bax's integral insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Either DNA damage to cells or expression of p53 selectively targeted to the mitochondria results in Bcl2-p53 binding followed by exposure of Bcl2's BH3 domain in association with inactivation of Bcl2's antiapoptotic function, indicating a conformational change in Bcl2 can occur upon direct ligation of p53. Thus, Bcl2's FLD contains both positive and negative regulatory regions which functionally regulate Bcl2's antiapoptotic activity by affecting Bax or p53 binding.

10400710|t|The human papillomavirus type 16 E6 oncoprotein can down-regulate p53 activity by targeting the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300.
10400710|t|The transforming proteins of the small DNA tumor viruses, simian virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, and human papillomavirus (HPV) target a number of identical cellular regulators whose functional abrogation is required for transformation. However, while both adenovirus E1A and SV40 large T transforming properties also depend on the targeting of the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, no such interaction has been described for the HPV oncoprotein E6 or E7. Here, we demonstrate that the HPV-16 E6 protein, previously shown to facilitate the degradation of p53 in a complex with E6-associated protein (E6AP), also targets CBP/p300 in an interaction involving the C-terminal zinc finger of E6 and CBP residues 1808 to 1826. Furthermore, this interaction is limited to E6 proteins of high-risk HPVs associated with cervical cancer that have the capacity to repress p53-dependent transcription. An HPV-16 E6 mutant (L50G) that binds CBP/p300, but not E6AP, is still capable of down-regulating p53 transcriptional activity. Thus, HPV E6 proteins possess two distinct mechanisms by which to abrogate p53 function: the repression of p53 transcriptional activity by targeting the p53 coactivator CBP/p300, and the removal of cellular p53 protein through the proteosome degradation pathway.

22553920|t|The activation mechanism of ACK1 (activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase 1).
22553920|t|ACK [activated Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)-associated tyrosine kinase; also called TNK2 (tyrosine kinase, non-receptor, 2)] is activated in response to multiple cellular signals, including cell adhesion, growth factor receptors and heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor signalling. However, the molecular mechanism underlying activation of ACK remains largely unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that interaction of the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain with the EBD [EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-binding domain] in ACK1 forms an auto-inhibition of the kinase activity. Release of this auto-inhibition is a key step for activation of ACK1. Mutation of the SH3 domain caused activation of ACK1, independent of cell adhesion, suggesting that cell adhesion-mediated activation of ACK1 is through releasing the auto-inhibition. A region at the N-terminus of ACK1 (Leu10-Leu14) is essential for cell adhesion-mediated activation. In the activation of ACK1 by EGFR signalling, Grb2 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2) mediates the interaction of ACK1 with EGFR through binding to the EBD and activates ACK1 by releasing the auto-inhibition. Furthermore, we found that mutation of Ser445 to proline caused constitutive activation of ACK1. Taken together, our studies have revealed a novel molecular mechanism underlying activation of ACK1.

26961874|t|αB-Crystallin Interacts with Nav1.5 and Regulates Ubiquitination and Internalization of Cell Surface Nav1.5.
26961874|t|Nav1.5, the pore-forming α subunit of the cardiac voltage-gated Na(+) channel complex, is required for the initiation and propagation of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in Nav1.5 cause cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The cardiac Na(+) channel functions as a protein complex; however, its complete components remain to be fully elucidated. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a new candidate Nav1.5-interacting protein, αB-crystallin. GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining analyses validated the interaction between Nav1.5 and αB-crystallin. Whole-cell patch clamping showed that overexpression of αB-crystallin significantly increased peak sodium current (INa) density, and the underlying molecular mechanism is the increased cell surface expression level of Nav1.5 via reduced internalization of cell surface Nav1.5 and ubiquitination of Nav1.5. Knock-out of αB-crystallin expression significantly decreased the cell surface expression level of Nav1.5. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that αB-crystallin interacted with Nedd4-2; however, a catalytically inactive Nedd4-2-C801S mutant impaired the interaction and abolished the up-regulation of INa by αB-crystallin. Nav1.5 mutation V1980A at the interaction site for Nedd4-2 eliminated the effect of αB-crystallin on reduction of Nav1.5 ubiquitination and increases of INa density. Two disease-causing mutations in αB-crystallin, R109H and R151X (nonsense mutation), eliminated the effect of αB-crystallin on INa This study identifies αB-crystallin as a new binding partner for Nav1.5. αB-Crystallin interacts with Nav1.5 and increases INa by modulating the expression level and internalization of cell surface Nav1.5 and ubiquitination of Nav1.5, which requires the protein-protein interactions between αB-crystallin and Nav1.5 and between αB-crystallin and functionally active Nedd4-2.

17766419|t|Chlamydophila pneumoniae PknD exhibits dual amino acid specificity and phosphorylates Cpn0712, a putative type III secretion YscD homolog.
17766419|t|Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes bronchitis, pharyngitis, and pneumonia and may be involved in atherogenesis and Alzheimer's disease. Genome sequencing has identified three eukaryote-type serine/threonine protein kinases, Pkn1, Pkn5, and PknD, that may be important signaling molecules in Chlamydia. Full-length PknD was cloned and expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli. Differential centrifugation followed by sodium carbonate treatment of E. coli membranes demonstrated that His-PknD is an integral membrane protein. Fusions of overlapping PknD fragments to alkaline phosphatase revealed that PknD contains a single transmembrane domain and that the kinase domain is in the cytoplasm. To facilitate solubility, the kinase domain was cloned and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli. Purified GST-PknD kinase domain autophosphorylated, and catalytic mutants (K33G, D156G, and K33G-D156G mutants) and activation loop mutants (T185A and T193A) were inactive. PknD phosphorylated recombinant Cpn0712, a type III secretion YscD homolog that has two forkhead-associated domains. Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the PknD kinase domain autophosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine and phosphorylated the FHA-2 domain of Cpn0712 on serine and tyrosine. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a bacterial protein kinase with amino acid specificity for both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues and this is the first study to show phosphorylation of a predicted type III secretion structural protein.

25978431|t|NPM-ALK mediates phosphorylation of MSH2 at tyrosine 238, creating a functional deficiency in MSH2 and the loss of mismatch repair.
25978431|t|The vast majority of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK+ALCL) tumors express the characteristic oncogenic fusion protein NPM-ALK, which mediates tumorigenesis by exerting its constitutive tyrosine kinase activity on various substrates. We recently identified MSH2, a protein central to DNA mismatch repair (MMR), as a novel binding partner and phosphorylation substrate of NPM-ALK. Here, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we report for the first time that MSH2 is phosphorylated by NPM-ALK at a specific residue, tyrosine 238. Using GP293 cells transfected with NPM-ALK, we confirmed that the MSH2(Y238F) mutant is not tyrosine phosphorylated. Furthermore, transfection of MSH2(Y238F) into these cells substantially decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous MSH2. Importantly, gene transfection of MSH2(Y238F) abrogated the binding of NPM-ALK with endogenous MSH2, re-established the dimerization of MSH2:MSH6 and restored the sensitivity to DNA mismatch-inducing drugs, indicative of MMR return. Parallel findings were observed in two ALK+ALCL cell lines, Karpas 299 and SUP-M2. In addition, we found that enforced expression of MSH2(Y238F) into ALK+ALCL cells alone was sufficient to induce spontaneous apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings have identified NPM-ALK-induced phosphorylation of MSH2 at Y238 as a crucial event in suppressing MMR. Our studies have provided novel insights into the mechanism by which oncogenic tyrosine kinases disrupt MMR.

7609904|t|Identification of a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site in the carboxy terminal tail of human D1 dopamine receptor.
7609904|t|Each of the dopamine receptor subtypes contains several consensus sites for phosphorylation in their intracellular domains. We have used fusion proteins of the carboxy terminal tail of D1 and D5 dopamine receptors to study the phosphorylation of these proteins by cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). The fusion protein of D1 dopamine receptor was efficiently phosphorylated by PKA, but not by PKC. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 380 to an alanine residue precluded the phosphorylation by the kinase. No phosphorylation of the D5 dopamine receptor fusion protein was observed with either PKA or PKC, which indicates that these receptor subtypes might differ in their mechanisms of regulation.

14699166|t|Effective dephosphorylation of Src substrates by SHP-1.
14699166|t|The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a negative regulator of multiple signal transduction pathways. We observed that SHP-1 effectively antagonized Src-dependent phosphorylations in HEK293 cells. This occurred by dephosphorylation of Src substrates, because Src activity was unaffected in the presence of SHP-1. One reason for efficient dephosphorylation was activation of SHP-1 by Src. Recombinant SHP-1 had elevated activity subsequent to phosphorylation by Src in vitro, and SHP-1 variants with mutated phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, SHP-1 Y538F, and SHP-1 Y538F,Y566F were less active toward Src-generated phosphoproteins in intact cells. A second reason for efficient dephosphorylation is the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. Pull-down experiments with different GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins revealed efficient interaction of Src-generated phosphoproteins with the SHP-1 catalytic domain rather than with the SH2 domains. Phosphopeptides that correspond to good Src substrates were efficiently dephosphorylated by SHP-1 in vitro. Phosphorylated "optimal Src substrate" AEEEIpYGEFEA (where pY is phosphotyrosine) and a phosphopeptide corresponding to a recently identified Src phosphorylation site in p120 catenin, DDLDpY(296)GMMSD, were excellent SHP-1 substrates. Docking of these phosphopeptides into the catalytic domain of SHP-1 by molecular modeling was consistent with the biochemical data and explains the efficient interaction. Acidic residues N-terminal of the phosphotyrosine seem to be of major importance for efficient substrate interaction. Residues C-terminal of the phosphotyrosine probably contribute to the substrate selectivity of SHP-1. We propose that activation of SHP-1 by Src and complementary substrate specificities of SHP-1 and Src may lead to very transient Src signals in the presence of SHP-1.

21084607|t|Protein S protects neurons from excitotoxic injury by activating the TAM receptor Tyro3-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway through its sex hormone-binding globulin-like region.
21084607|t|The anticoagulant factor protein S (PS) protects neurons from hypoxic/ischemic injury. However, molecular mechanisms mediating PS protection in injured neurons remain unknown. Here, we show mouse recombinant PS protects dose-dependently mouse cortical neurons from excitotoxic NMDA-mediated neuritic bead formation and apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway (EC(50) = 26 ± 4 nm). PS stimulated phosphorylation of Bad and Mdm2, two downstream targets of Akt, which in neurons subjected to pathological overstimulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) increased the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) levels and reduced the proapoptotic p53 and Bax levels. Adenoviral transduction with a kinase-deficient Akt mutant (Ad.Akt(K179A)) resulted in loss of PS-mediated neuronal protection, Akt activation, and Bad and Mdm2 phosphorylation. Using the TAM receptors tyrosine kinases Tyro3-, Axl-, and Mer-deficient neurons, we showed that PS protected neurons lacking Axl and Mer, but not Tyro3, suggesting a requirement of Tyro3 for PS-mediated protection. Consistent with these results, PS dose-dependently phosphorylated Tyro3 on neurons (EC(50) = 25 ± 3 nm). In an in vivo model of NMDA-induced excitotoxic lesions in the striatum, PS dose-dependently reduced the lesion volume in control mice (EC(50) = 22 ± 2 nm) and protected Axl(-/-) and Mer(-/-) transgenic mice, but not Tyro3(-/-) transgenic mice. Using different structural PS analogs, we demonstrated that the C terminus sex hormone-binding globulin-like (SHBG) domain of PS is critical for neuronal protection in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our data show that PS protects neurons by activating the Tyro3-PI3K-Akt pathway via its SHGB domain, suggesting potentially a novel neuroprotective approach for acute brain injury and chronic neurodegenerative disorders associated with excessive activation of NMDARs.

9482104|t|Characterization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory domain of the INK4 family as a model for a synthetic tumour suppressor molecule.
9482104|t|We have previously shown that a 20 amino acid peptide derived from the third ankyrin-like repeat of the p16CDKN2/INK4a (p16) tumour suppressor protein (residues 84-103 of the human p16 protein) can bind to cdk4 and cdk6 and inhibit cdk4-cyclin D1 kinase activity in vitro as well as block cell cycle progression through G1. Substitution of two valine residues corresponding to amino acids 95 and 96 (V95A and V96A) of the p16 peptide reduces the binding to cdk4 and cdk6 and increases its IC0.5 for kinase inhibition approximately threefold when linked to the Antennapedia homeodomain carrier sequence. The same mutations increase the IC0.5 approximately fivefold in the p16 protein. Substitution of aspartic acid 92 by alanine instead increases the binding of the peptide to cdk4 and cdk6 and the kinase inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide blocks S-phase entry in non-synchronized human HaCaT cells by approximately 90% at a 24 microM concentration. The V95A and V96A double substitution minimizes the cell cycle inhibitory capacity of the peptide whereas the D92A substitution increases its capacity to block cell cycle progression. A deletion series of the p16 derived peptide shows that a 10 residue peptide still retains cdk4-cyclin D1 kinase and cell cycle inhibitory activity. The p16 peptide inhibited S-phase entry in five cell lines tested, varying between 47-75%, but had only a limited (11%) inhibitory effect in the pRb negative Saos-2 cells at a concentration of 24 microM. Like the full length p16 protein, the p16 peptide does not inhibit cyclin E dependent cdk2 kinase activity in vitro. These data suggest that acute inhibition of CDK-cyclin D activity by a peptide derived from the INK4 family will stop cells in late G1 in a pRb dependent fashion.

8827714|t|The MDM2 oncoprotein binds specifically to RNA through its RING finger domain.
8827714|t|BACKGROUND: The cellular mdm2 gene has transforming activity when overexpressed and is amplified in a variety of human tumors. At least part of the transforming ability of the MDM2 protein is due to binding and inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Additionally, this protein forms a complex in vivo with the L5 ribosomal protein and its associated 5S ribosomal RNA and may be part of a ribosomal complex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RNA homopolymer binding assay and a SELEX procedure have been used to characterize the RNA-binding activity of MDM2. RESULTS: The MDM2 protein binds efficiently to the homopolyribonucleotide poly(G) but not to other homopolyribonucleotides. This binding is independent of the interaction of MDM2 with the L5 protein, which occurs through the central acidic domain of MDM2. An RNA SELEX procedure was performed to identify specific RNA ligands that bind with high affinity to the human MDM2 (HDM2) protein. After 10 rounds of selection and amplification, a subset of RNA molecules that bound efficiently to HDM2 was isolated from a randomized pool. Sequencing of these selected ligands revealed that a small number of sequence motifs were selected. The specific RNA binding occurs through the RING finger domain of the protein. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in the RING finger domain, G446S, completely abolishes the specific RNA binding. CONCLUSIONS: These observations, showing that MDM2 binds the L5/5S ribosomal ribonucleoprotein particle and can also bind to specific RNA sequences or structures, suggest a role for MDM2 in translational regulation in a cell.

10620507|t|14-3-3 isotypes facilitate coupling of protein kinase C-zeta to Raf-1: negative regulation by 14-3-3 phosphorylation.
10620507|t|14-3-3 Proteins may function as adapters or scaffold in signal-transduction pathways. We found previously that protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) can phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 in a signalling complex [van Dijk, Hilkmann and van Blitterswijk (1997) Biochem. J. 325, 303-307]. We report now that PKC-zeta-Raf-1 interaction is mediated by 14-3-3 proteins in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS cells revealed that complex formation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1 is mediated strongly by the 14-3-3beta and -theta; isotypes, but not by 14-3-3zeta. Far-Western blotting revealed that 14-3-3 binds PKC-zeta directly at its regulatory domain, where a S186A mutation in a putative 14-3-3-binding domain strongly reduced the binding and the complex formation with 14-3-3beta and Raf-1. Treatment of PKC-zeta with lambda protein phosphatase also reduced its binding to 14-3-3beta in vitro. Preincubation of an immobilized Raf-1 construct with 14-3-3beta facilitated PKC-zeta binding. Together, the results suggest that 14-3-3 binds both PKC-zeta (at phospho-Ser-186) and Raf-1 in a ternary complex. Complex formation was much stronger with a kinase-inactive PKC-zeta mutant than with wild-type PKC-zeta, supporting the idea that kinase activity leads to complex dissociation. 14-3-3beta and -&theta; were substrates for PKC-zeta, whereas 14-3-3zeta was not. Phosphorylation of 14-3-3beta by PKC-zeta negatively regulated their physical association. 14-3-3beta with its putative PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites mutated enhanced co-precipitation between PKC-zeta and Raf-1, suggesting that phosphorylation of 14-3-3 by PKC-zeta weakens the complex in vivo. We conclude that 14-3-3 facilitates coupling of PKC-zeta to Raf-1 in an isotype-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner. We suggest that 14-3-3 is a transient mediator of Raf-1 phosphorylation and activation by PKC-zeta.

17559069|t|Claudin-16 is directly phosphorylated by protein kinase A independently of a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-mediated pathway.
17559069|t|Claudin-16 (CLDN-16) is involved in the paracellular reabsorption of Mg(2+) in the thick ascending limb of Henle. The tight junctional localization and Mg(2+) transport of CLDN-16 are regulated by cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Here, we examined whether PKA phosphorylates CLDN-16 in a direct or indirect manner. CLDN-16 was stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using a Tet-OFF system. The phosphorylation of CLDN-16 is upregulated by fetal calf serum (FCS). This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by a PKA inhibitor, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride. Without FCS, dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) increased the phosphoserine level of CLDN-16 in a concentration-dependent manner. The phosphorylated CLDN-16 elicited increases of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and transepithelial transport of Mg(2+). Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was also phosphorylated in the presence of FCS or DBcAMP. In the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull down assay, a cytosolic carboxyl domain of CLDN-16 was associated with PKA, but not with VASP. Furthermore, PKA was immunoprecipitated with CLDN-16 in MDCK cells, but VASP was not. In cells expressing a dephosphorylated mutant (Ser160Ala) of VASP, CLDN-16 was phosphorylated by DBcAMP and was associated with ZO-1, a tight junctional-scaffolding protein, without integral cell-cell junctions. We suggest that PKA directly phosphorylates CLDN-16, resulting in the localization to tight junctions (TJs) and the maintenance of Mg(2+) reabsorption.

14597981|t|A mutation in the integrin alphaIIb subunit that selectively inhibits alphaIIb beta3 receptor function.
14597981|t|The alpha(IIb) and alpha(v) integrins have been shown to play a significant role in a variety of disease processes. alpha(IIb)beta(3) is a platelet-specific fibrinogen receptor that is critical for thrombosis and hemostasis. Determination of the basis of ligand recognition by alpha(IIb)beta(3) is essential for modulation of platelet function. To identify alpha(IIb) residues involved in alpha(IIb)beta(3) ligand binding function, cells expressing a constitutively active variant of alpha(IIb)beta(3) were randomly mutagenized and selected for loss of alpha(IIb)beta(3) ligand binding function. One mutant isolated in this manner contained a single amino acid substitution at position 96 in alpha(IIb) (Ser9-->Leu). Cells expressing this alpha(IIb) mutant did not bind the ligand mimetic antibody PAC1 or adhere to fibrinogen. In addition, the mutant receptor did not bind to an RGD affinity matrix. Substitution of conserved serine residues at position 1 in beta strand A of all seven repeats of alpha(IIb) similarly inhibited ligand binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). alpha(IIb)S96 maps to the central cavity of the beta-propeller fold of the alpha(IIb) subunit immediately adjacent to a structurally important sequence at the center of the alphaand beta subunit interface. In contrast, substitution of the analogous residues in alpha(v) or alpha(4) did not disrupt the ligand binding function of alpha(v)beta(3) or alpha(4)beta(1). These data support a potential unique structural or mechanistic role for this residue in alpha(IIb)beta(3) receptor function.

12888550|t|Oligomerization of the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Potential implications in receptor internalization.
12888550|t|We combined biophysical, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to investigate the ability of the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes to form homo- and hetero-oligomers. Receptors tagged with different epitopes (hemagglutinin and Myc) or fluorescent proteins (cyan and green fluorescent proteins) were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells either individually or in different combinations. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements provided evidence that both the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR can form homo-oligomers with similar transfer efficiency of approximately 0.10. Hetero-oligomers could also be observed between the alpha 1b- and the alpha 1a-AR subtypes but not between the alpha 1b-AR and the beta2-AR, the NK1 tachykinin, or the CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization of the alpha 1b-AR did not require the integrity of its C-tail, of two glycophorin motifs, or of the N-linked glycosylation sites at its N terminus. In contrast, helix I and, to a lesser extent, helix VII were found to play a role in the alpha 1b-AR homo-oligomerization. Receptor oligomerization was not influenced by the agonist epinephrine or by the inverse agonist prazosin. A constitutively active (A293E) as well as a signaling-deficient (R143E) mutant displayed oligomerization features similar to those of the wild type alpha 1b-AR. Confocal imaging revealed that oligomerization of the alpha1-AR subtypes correlated with their ability to co-internalize upon exposure to the agonist. The alpha 1a-selective agonist oxymetazoline induced the co-internalization of the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR, whereas the alpha 1b-AR could not co-internalize with the NK1 tachykinin or CCR5 chemokine receptors. Oligomerization might therefore represent an additional mechanism regulating the physiological responses mediated by the alpha 1a- and alpha 1b-AR subtypes.

11551930|t|Plk3 functionally links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at least in part via the p53 pathway.
11551930|t|Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3, previously termed Prk) contributes to regulation of M phase of the cell cycle (Ouyang, B., Pan, H., Lu, L., Li, J., Stambrook, P., Li, B., and Dai, W. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28646-28651). Plk3 physically interacts with Cdc25C and phosphorylates this protein phosphatase predominantly on serine 216 (Ouyang, B., Li, W., Pan, H., Meadows, J., Hoffmann, I., and Dai, W. (1999) Oncogene 18, 6029-6036), suggesting that the role of Plk3 in mitosis is mediated, at least in part, through direct regulation of Cdc25C. Here we show that ectopic expression of a kinase-active Plk3 (Plk3-A) induced apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, the kinase activity of Plk3 was rapidly increased in an ATM-dependent manner, whereas that of Plk1 was markedly inhibited. Recombinant Plk3 phosphorylated in vitro a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing p53, but not glutathione S-transferase alone. Recombinant Plk1 also phosphorylated p53 but on residues that differed from those targeted by Plk3. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Plk3 physically interacted with p53 and that this interaction was enhanced upon DNA damage. In vitro kinase assays followed by immunoblotting showed that serine 20 of p53 was a target of Plk3. Furthermore, expression of a kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3(K52R)) resulted in significant reduction of p53 phosphorylation on serine 20, which was correlated with a decrease in the expression of p21 and with a concomitant increase in cell proliferation. These results strongly suggest that Plk3 functionally links DNA damage to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the p53 pathway.

14573774|t|Selective interaction of ARF1 with the carboxy-terminal tail domain of the 5-HT2A receptor.
14573774|t|The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is a member of the class I family of rhodopsin-related G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor is known to activate phospholipase C via the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq/11, but we showed previously that it can also signal through the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway in an ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent manner that seems to be independent of Gq/11 (Mitchell et al., 1998). Both coimmunoprecipitation experiments and the effects of negative mutant ARF constructs on 5-HT2AR-induced PLD activation here suggested that ARF1 may play a greater role than ARF6 in the function of this receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrated using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins of receptor domains that ARF1 and ARF6 bind to the third intracellular loop (i3) and the carboxy terminal tail (ct) of the 5-HT2AR. The association of ARF1 with the ct domain of the receptor was stronger than its interaction with i3, or the interactions of ARF6 with either construct. Experiments using ARF mutants that are deficient in GTP loading, and the in vitro addition of GTPgammaS suggested that GTP loading enhances ARF1 binding to the receptor. The N376PxxY motif in the transmembrane 7 domain of the receptor (rather than a N376DPxxY mutant form) was shown to be essential for ARF-dependent PLD signaling and ARF1 coimmunoprecipitation. In GST-fusion proteins of the 5-HT2AR ct domain, mutation of Asn376 to Asp also markedly reduced ARF1-HA binding, although additional motifs in the Asn376-Asn384 sequence and to a lesser extent elsewhere, seem also to contribute to the interaction.

18591664|t|Syntrophin mutation associated with long QT syndrome through activation of the nNOS-SCN5A macromolecular complex.
18591664|t|Mutations in 11 genes that encode ion channels or their associated proteins cause inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS) and account for approximately 75-80% of cases (LQT1-11). Direct sequencing of SNTA1, the gene encoding alpha1-syntrophin, was performed in a cohort of LQTS patients that were negative for mutations in the 11 known LQTS-susceptibility genes. A missense mutation (A390V-SNTA1) was found in a patient with recurrent syncope and markedly prolonged QT interval (QTc, 530 ms). SNTA1 links neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the nNOS inhibitor plasma membrane Ca-ATPase subtype 4b (PMCA4b); SNTA1 also is known to associate with the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A. By using a GST-fusion protein of the C terminus of SCN5A, we showed that WT-SNTA1 interacted with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b. In contrast, A390V-SNTA1 selectively disrupted association of PMCA4b with this complex and increased direct nitrosylation of SCN5A. A390V-SNTA1 expressed with SCN5A, nNOS, and PMCA4b in heterologous cells increased peak and late sodium current compared with WT-SNTA1, and the increase was partially inhibited by NOS blockers. Expression of A390V-SNTA1 in cardiac myocytes also increased late sodium current. We conclude that the A390V mutation disrupted binding with PMCA4b, released inhibition of nNOS, caused S-nitrosylation of SCN5A, and was associated with increased late sodium current, which is the characteristic biophysical dysfunction for sodium-channel-mediated LQTS (LQT3). These results establish an SNTA1-based nNOS complex attached to SCN5A as a key regulator of sodium current and suggest that SNTA1 be considered a rare LQTS-susceptibility gene.

17369852|t|SUMO modification of the DEAD box protein p68 modulates its transcriptional activity and promotes its interaction with HDAC1.
17369852|t|The nuclear protein p68 (also known as Ddx5) is a prototypic member of the 'DEAD box' family of RNA helicases, which has been shown to be abnormally expressed and modified in colorectal tumors and to function as an important transcriptional regulator. Here, we show that p68 is modified in vivo on a single site (K53) by the small ubiquitin-like modifier-2 (SUMO-2). We demonstrate that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 interacts with p68 and enhances its SUMO modification in vivo. To determine the functional consequences of SUMO modification, we compared the transcriptional activity of p68 and a K53R mutant that could not be SUMO-modified. Our data show that SUMO modification enhances p68 transcriptional repression activity and inhibits the ability of p68 to function as a coactivator of p53. These findings may be explained by the ability of wild type, but not K53R p68, to alter the modification state of chromatin by recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1).

10340301|t|The protein kinase C alpha binding protein PICK1 interacts with short but not long form alternative splice variants of AMPA receptor subunits.
10340301|t|Here we report an interaction between AMPA receptor subunits and a single PDZ domain-containing protein called PICK1 which is known to bind protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha). The interaction occurs within the last ten amino acid residues containing a novel PDZ binding motif (E S V/I K I) of the short C-terminal alternative splice variants of AMPA receptor subunits. No interaction occurs with the corresponding long splice variants which do not contain the E S V/I K I motif. The PDZ domain of PICK1 is required for the interaction and the mutation of a single amino acid in this region (Lys-27 to Glu) prevents interaction between PICK1 and GluR2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. A similar mutation has been reported to prevent the binding of PICK1 to PKC alpha indicating that the same domain of PICK1 binds both PKC alpha and GluRs. Flag-tagged PICK1 is retained by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the C-terminal of GluR2 (GST-ct-GluR2; short splice variant) but not by GST-ct-GluR1 (long splice variant). Recombinant full length GluR2 is coimmunoprecipitated with flag-PICK1 using an anti-flag antibody and flag-PICK1 is coimmunoprecipitated with an N-terminal directed anti-GluR2 antibody. Transient expression of both proteins in COS cells reveals colocalization and an altered pattern of distribution for each protein from when they are expressed individually. This novel interaction provides a possible regulatory mechanism to specifically modulate distinct splice variants and may be involved in targeting the phosphorylation of short form GluRs by PKC alpha.

11278485|t|Phosphorylation-independent association of CXCR2 with the protein phosphatase 2A core enzyme.
11278485|t|Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is postulated to be involved in the dephosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 physically interacts with the PP2A core enzyme, a dimer formed by PP2Ac and PR65, but not with the PP2Ac monomer, suggesting direct interaction of the receptor with PR65. The integrity of a sequence motif in the C terminus of CXCR2, KFRHGL, which is conserved in all CC and CXC chemokine receptors, is required for the receptor binding to the PP2A core enzyme. CXCR2 co-immunoprecipitates with the PP2A core enzyme in HEK293 cells and in human neutrophils. Overexpression of dominant negative dynamin 1 (dynamin 1 K44A) in CXCR2-expressing cells blocks the receptor association with the PP2A core enzyme, and an internalization-deficient mutant form of CXCR2 (I323A,L324A) also exhibits impaired association with the PP2A core enzyme, suggesting that the receptor internalization is required for the receptor binding to PP2A. A phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2 (331T), which has previously been shown to undergo internalization in HEK293 cells, binds to an almost equal amount of the PP2A core enzyme in comparison with the wild-type CXCR2, suggesting that the interaction of the receptor with PP2A is phosphorylation-independent. The dephosphorylation of CXCR2 is reversed by treatment of the cells with okadaic acid. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid increases basal phosphorylation of CXCR2 and attenuates CXCR2-mediated calcium mobilization and chemotaxis. Taken together, these data indicate that PP2A is involved in the dephosphorylation of CXCR2. We postulate that this interaction results from direct binding of the regulatory subunit A (PR65) of PP2A to the carboxyl terminus of CXCR2 after receptor sequestration and internalization.

16672228|t|Crystal structure of the Orf virus NZ2 variant of vascular endothelial growth factor-E. Implications for receptor specificity.
16672228|t|Mammalian vascular endothelial growth factors constitute a family of polypeptides, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, -B, -C, -D and placenta growth factor (PlGF), that regulate blood and lymphatic vessel development. VEGFs bind to three types of receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, that are predominantly expressed on endothelial and some hematopoietic cells. Pox viruses of the Orf family encode highly related proteins called VEGF-E that show only 25-35% amino acid identity with VEGF-A but bind with comparable affinity to VEGFR-2. The crystal structure of VEGF-E NZ2 described here reveals high similarity to the known structural homologs VEGF-A, PlGF, and the snake venoms Vammin and VR-1, which are all homodimers and contain the characteristic cysteine knot motif. Distinct conformational differences are observed in loop L1 and particularly in L3, which contains a highly flexible GS-rich motif that differs from all other structural homologs. Based on our structure, we created chimeric proteins by exchanging selected segments in L1 and L3 with the corresponding sequences from PlGF. Single loop mutants did not bind to either receptor, whereas a VEGF-E mutant in which both L1 and L3 were replaced gained affinity for VEGFR-1, illustrating the possibility to engineer receptor-specific chimeric VEGF molecules. In addition, changing arginine 46 to isoleucine in L1 significantly increased the affinity of VEGF-E for both VEGF receptors.

11447225|t|Reactive oxygen species-induced phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 is mediated in part by polo-like kinase-3.
11447225|t|Upon exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) phosphorylation of p53 was rapidly induced in human fibroblast GM00637, and this phosphorylation occurred on serine 9, serine 15, serine 20, but not on serine 392. In addition, H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of p53 was followed by induction of p21, suggesting functional activation of p53. Induction of phosphorylation of p53 on multiple serine residues by H(2)O(2) was caffeine-sensitive and blocked in ATM(-/-) cells. Polo-like kinase-3 (Plk3) activity was also activated upon H(2)O(2) treatment, and this activation was ATM-dependent. Recombinant His(6)-Plk3 phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p53 fusion protein but not GST alone. When phoshorylated in vitro by His(6)-Plk3, but not by the kinase-defective mutant His6-Plk3(K52R), GST-p53 was recognized by an antibody specifically to serine 20-phosphorylated p53, indicating that serine 20 is an in vitro target of Plk3. Also serine 20-phosphorylated p53 was coimmunoprecipitated with Plk3 in cells treated with H(2)O(2). Furthermore, although H(2)O(2) strongly induced serine 15 phosphorylation of p53, it failed to induce serine 20 phosphorylation in Plk3-dificient Daudi cells. Ectopic expression of a Plk3 dominant negative mutant, Plk3(K52R), in GM00637 cells suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced serine 20 phosphorylation. Taken together, our studies strongly suggest that the oxidative stress-induced activation of p53 is at least in part mediated by Plk3.

15913697|t|An interaction site of the envelope proteins of Semliki Forest virus that is preserved after proteolytic activation.
15913697|t|Semliki Forest virus (SFV) membrane fusion is mediated by the viral E1 protein at acidic pH and regulated by the dimeric interaction of E1 with the E2 membrane protein. During low pH-triggered fusion, the E2/E1 heterodimer dissociates, freeing E1 to drive membrane fusion. E2 is synthesized as a precursor, p62, which is processed to mature E2 by the cellular protease furin. Both the dissociation of the p62/E1 dimer and the fusion reaction of p62 virus have a more acidic pH threshold than that of the mature E2 virus. We have previously isolated SFV mutations that allow virus growth in furin-deficient cells. Here we have used such pci mutations to compare the interactions of the p62/E1 and E2/E1 dimers. Our data suggest that there is an important p62/E1 dimer interaction site identified by an E2 R250G mutation and that this interaction is maintained after processing to the mature E2 protein.

18281688|t|Effect of the active site D25N mutation on the structure, stability, and ligand binding of the mature HIV-1 protease.
18281688|t|All aspartic proteases, including retroviral proteases, share the triplet DTG critical for the active site geometry and catalytic function. These residues interact closely in the active, dimeric structure of HIV-1 protease (PR). We have systematically assessed the effect of the D25N mutation on the structure and stability of the mature PR monomer and dimer. The D25N mutation (PR(D25N)) increases the equilibrium dimer dissociation constant by a factor >100-fold (1.3 +/- 0.09 microm) relative to PR. In the absence of inhibitor, NMR studies reveal clear structural differences between PR and PR(D25N) in the relatively mobile P1 loop (residues 79-83) and flap regions, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses show that the mutation lowers the stabilities of both the monomer and dimer folds by 5 and 7.3 degrees C, respectively. Only minimal differences are observed in high resolution crystal structures of PR(D25N) complexed to darunavir (DRV), a potent clinical inhibitor, or a non-hydrolyzable substrate analogue, Ac-Thr-Ile-Nle-r-Nle-Gln-Arg-NH(2) (RPB), as compared with PR.DRV and PR.RPB complexes. Although complexation with RPB stabilizes both dimers, the effect on their T(m) is smaller for PR(D25N) (6.2 degrees C) than for PR (8.7 degrees C). The T(m) of PR(D25N).DRV increases by only 3 degrees C relative to free PR(D25N), as compared with a 22 degrees C increase for PR.DRV, and the mutation increases the ligand dissociation constant of PR(D25N).DRV by a factor of approximately 10(6) relative to PR.DRV. These results suggest that interactions mediated by the catalytic Asp residues make a major contribution to the tight binding of DRV to PR.

24347472|t|Skp2 regulates androgen receptor through ubiquitin-mediated degradation independent of Akt/mTOR pathways in prostate cancer.
24347472|t|BACKGROUND: The intervention of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) in patients has been commonly depending on androgen deprivation therapy. Despite of tremendous research efforts, however, molecular mechanisms on AR regulation remain poorly understood, particularly for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Targeting AR and associated factors is considered an effective strategy in PCa treatment. METHODS: Human prostate cancer cells were used in this study. Manipulations of Skp2 expression were achieved by Skp2 shRNA/siRNA or overexpression of plasmids. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied for AR activity assessment. Western blot, ubiquitination assay, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence were applied to detect the proteins. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Skp2 directly involves the regulation of AR expression through ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Skp2 interacted with AR protein in PCa cells, and enforced expression of Skp2 resulted in a decreased level and activity of AR. By contrast, Skp2 knockdown increased the protein accumulation and activity of AR. Importantly, changes of AR contributed by Skp2 led to subsequent alterations of PSA level in PCa cells. AR ubiquitination was significantly increased upon Skp2 overexpression but greatly reduced upon Skp2 knockdown. AR mutant at K847R abrogated Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of AR. NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, remarkably inhibited Skp2 level with a striking elevation of AR. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Skp2 is an E3 ligase for proteasome-dependent AR degradation, and K847 on AR is the recognition site for Skp2-mediated ubiquitination. Our findings reveal an essential role of Skp2 in AR signaling.

10506747|t|Arf proteins bind to mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (MKLP1) in a GTP-dependent fashion.
10506747|t|Arf proteins comprise a family of 21-kDa GTP-binding proteins with many proposed functions in mammalian cells, including the regulation of several steps of membrane transport, maintenance of organelle integrity, and activation of phospholipase D. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of human cDNA libraries using a dominant activating allele, [Q71L], of human Arf3 as bait. Eleven independent isolates contained plasmids encoding the C-terminal tail of mitotic kinesin-like protein-1 (MKLP1). Further deletion mapping allowed the identification of an 88 amino acid Arf3 binding domain in the C-terminus of MKLP1. This domain has no clear homology to other Arf binding proteins or to other proteins in the protein databases. The C-terminal domain of MKLP1 was expressed and purified from bacteria as a GST fusion protein and shown to bind Arf3 in a GTP-dependent fashion. A screen for mutations in Arf3 that specifically lost the ability to bind MKLP1 identified 10 of 14 point mutations in the GTP-sensitive switch I or switch II regions of Arf3. Two-hybrid assays of the C-terminal domain of MKLP1 with each of the human Arf isoforms revealed strong interaction with each. Taken together, these data are all supportive of the conclusion that activated Arf proteins bind to the C-terminal "tail" domain of MKLP1.

22302998|t|E-cadherin inhibits nuclear accumulation of Nrf2: implications for chemoresistance of cancer cells.
22302998|t|Nrf2 has an anti-carcinogenic effect. However, an increase in Nrf2 activity is also implicated in cancer chemoresistance. A switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin affects the transdifferentiation and metastasis of cancer cells. In view of the key role of this switch in cancer malignancy, we investigated the regulatory effect of E-cadherin on Nrf2. In HEK293 cells, overexpression of E-cadherin inhibited the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, and prevented Nrf2-dependent gene induction. GST pull-down and immunocytochemical assays verified the interaction between E-cadherin and Nrf2: E-cadherin bound the C-terminus of Nrf2, but not its N-terminus, which comprises the Neh2 domain responsible for phosphorylation of Ser40. Our finding that the mutation of Ser40 to alanine in Nrf2 did not affect the ability of E-cadherin to bind Nrf2 and repress target gene transactivation suggests that E-cadherin might not disturb the phosphorylation. Studies using mutant constructs of E-cadherin suggested that the β-catenin-binding domain contributes to the inhibitory effect of E-cadherin on Nrf2. Consistently, knockdown of β-catenin attenuated not only the effect of E-cadherin binding to Nrf2, but also Keap1-dependent ubiquitylation of Nrf2, and thereby increased Nrf2 activity, supporting the involvement of β-catenin in the interactions. Collectively, E-cadherin recruits Nrf2 through β-catenin, and assists the function of Keap1 for the inhibition of nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of Nrf2. In HepG2 cells, the loss of E-cadherin by either siRNA knockdown or treatment with TGFβ1 enhanced the constitutive or inducible activity of Nrf2, implying that chemoresistance of cancer cells upon the loss of E-cadherin might be associated with Nrf2.

11416144|t|ZBP-89 promotes growth arrest through stabilization of p53.
11416144|t|Transcription factor p53 can induce growth arrest and/or apoptosis in cells through activation or repression of downstream target genes. Recently, we reported that ZBP-89 cooperates with histone acetyltransferase coactivator p300 in the regulation of p21(waf1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose associated gene is a target gene of p53. Therefore, we examined whether ZBP-89 might also inhibit cell growth by activating p53. In the present study, we demonstrate that elevated levels of ZBP-89 induce growth arrest and apoptosis in human gastrointestinal cell lines. The ZBP-89 protein accumulated within 4 h, and the p53 protein accumulated within 16 h, of serum starvation without changes in p14ARF levels, demonstrating a physiological increase in the cellular levels of these two proteins. Overexpression of ZBP-89 stabilized the p53 protein and enhanced its transcriptional activity through direct protein-protein interactions. The DNA binding and C-terminal domains of p53 and the zinc finger domain of ZBP-89 mediated the interaction. A point mutation in the p53 DNA binding domain, R273H, greatly reduced ZBP-89-mediated stabilization but not their physical interaction. Furthermore, ZBP-89 formed a complex with p53 and MDM2 and therefore did not prevent the MDM2-p53 interaction. However, heterokaryon assays demonstrated that ZBP-89 retained p53 in the nucleus. Collectively, these data indicate that ZBP-89 regulates cell proliferation in part through its ability to directly bind the p53 protein and retard its nuclear export. Our findings further our understanding of how ZBP-89 modulates cell proliferation and reveals a novel mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized.

12433927|t|A stable human p53 heterotetramer based on constructive charge interactions within the tetramerization domain.
12433927|t|The human p53 tetramerization domain (called p53tet; residues 325-355) spontaneously forms a dimer of dimers in solution. Hydrophobic interactions play a major role in stabilizing the p53 tetramer. However, the distinctive arrangement of charged residues at the dimer-dimer interface suggests that they also contribute to tetramer stability. Charge-reversal mutations at positions 343, 346, and 351 within the dimer-dimer interface were thus introduced into p53tet constructs and shown to result in the selective formation of a stable heterotetramer composed of homodimers. More precisely, mutants p53tet-E343K/E346K and p53tet-K351E preferentially associated with each other, but not with wild-type p53tet, to form a heterodimeric tetramer with enhanced thermal stability relative to either of the two components in isolation. The p53tet-E343K/E346K mutant alone assembled into a weakly stable tetramer in solution, whereas p53tet-K351E existed only as a dimer. Moreover, these mutants did not form heterocomplexes with wild-type p53tet, illustrating the specificity of the ionic interactions that form the novel heterotetramer. This study demonstrates the dramatic importance of ionic interactions in altering the stability of the p53 tetramer and in selectively creating heterotetramers of this protein scaffold.

12374801|t|Follicle-stimulating hormone interacts with exoloop 3 of the receptor.
12374801|t|The human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor consists of two distinct domains of approximately 330 amino acids, the N-terminal extracellular exodomain and membrane-associated endodomain including three exoloops and seven transmembrane helices. The exodomain binds the hormone with high affinity, and the resulting hormone/exodomain complex modulates the endodomain where receptor activation occurs. It has been an enigma whether the hormone interacts with the endodomain. In a step to address the question, exoloop 3 of (580)KVPLITVSKAK(590) was examined by Ala scan, multiple substitution, assays for hormone binding, cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) induction, and photoaffinity labeling. We present the evidence for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. A peptide mimic of exoloop 3 specifically and saturably photoaffinity-labels FSH alpha but not FSH beta. This is in contrast to photoaffinity labeling of FSH beta by the peptide mimic of the N-terminal region of the receptor. Leu(583) and Ile(584) are crucial for the interaction of FSH and exoloop 3. Substitutions of these two residues enhanced the hormone binding affinity. This is due to the loss of the original side chains but not the introduction of new side chains. The Leu(583) and Ile(584) side chains appear to project in opposite directions. Ile(584) appears to be so specific and to require flexibility and stereo specificity so that no other amino acids can fit into its place. Leu(583) is less specific. The improvement in hormone binding by substitutions was offset by the severe impairment of signal generation of cAMP and/or inositol phosphate. For example, the Phe or Tyr substitution of Leu(583) improved the hormone binding and cAMP induction but impaired IP induction. On the other hand, the substitutions for Ile(584) and Lys(590) abolished the cAMP and IP induction. Our results open a logical question whether Leu(583), Ile(584), and Lys(590) interact with the exodomain and/or the hormone. The answers will provide new insights into the mechanisms of hormone binding and signal generation.

19122147|t|Crystal structure of the conserved N-terminal domain of the peroxisomal matrix protein import receptor, Pex14p.
19122147|t|Pex14p is a central component of the peroxisomal protein import machinery, in which the conserved N-terminal domain mediates dynamic interactions with other peroxins including Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p. Here, we report the crystal structure of the conserved N-terminal domain of Pex14p with a three-helix bundle. A hydrophobic surface is composed of the conserved residues, of which two phenylalanine residues (Phe-35 and Phe-52) protrude to the solvent. Consequently, two putative binding pockets suitable for recognizing the helical WXXXF/Y motif of Pex5p are formed on the surface by the two phenylalanine residues accompanying with positively charged residues. The structural feature agrees well with our earlier findings where F35A/L36A and F52A/L53A mutants were impaired in the interactions with other peroxins such as Pex5p and Pex13p. Pex14p variants each with Phe-to-Ala mutation at positions 35, 52, and 35/52, respectively, were defective in restoring the impaired peroxisomal protein import in pex14 Chinese hamster ovary mutant ZP161 cells. Moreover, in GST pull-down assays His(6)-Pex5pL bound only to GST-Pex14p(25-70), not to any of GST-Pex14p(25-70)F35A, GST-Pex14p(25-70)F52A, and GST-Pex14p(25-70)F35A/F52A. Endogenous Pex5p was recruited to FLAG-Pex14p on peroxisomes in vivo but barely to FLAG-Pex14pF35A, FLAG-Pex14pF52A, and FLAG-Pex14pF35A/F52A. Collectively, Phe-35 and Phe-52 are essential for the Pex14p functions, including the interaction between Pex14p and Pex5p.

10092663|t|The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-related GTPase ARF-related protein binds to the ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin and inhibits the ARF-dependent activation of phospholipase D.
10092663|t|ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein (ARP) is a membrane-associated GTPase with remote similarity to the family of ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF). In a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins interacting with ARP, we isolated a partial cDNA of the ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor mSec7-1/cytohesin encoding its N terminus and most of the Sec7 domain (codons 1-200). ARP and ARP-Q79L (GTPase-negative ARP) exhibited a higher affinity to mSec7-1-(1-200) than ARP-T31N (nucleotide exchange-defective ARP) in the two-hybrid assay. Similarly, full-length [35S]mSec7-1/cytohesin was specifically adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose loaded with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ARP-Q79L, GST-ARP, or GST-ARP-T31N, the latter exhibiting the lowest binding affinity. Overexpression of ARP-Q79L, but not of ARP-T31N, in COS-7 cells reduced the fluorescence from co-expressed green fluorescent protein fused with mSec7-1/cytohesin or mSec7-2/ARNO in plasma membranes as detected by deconvolution microscopy. Recombinant ARP and ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by mSec7-2/ARNO and ARF in a system of isolated membranes. Furthermore, transfection of HEK-293 cells with ARP or ARP-Q79L, but not ARP-T31N, inhibited the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-3 induced PLD stimulation and translocation of ARF from cytosol to membranes. These data suggest that the GTP-bound form of ARP specifically binds mSec7-1/cytohesin, and that ARP may be involved in a pathway inhibiting the ARF-controlled activity of PLD.

11331421|t|Interaction of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1: effect of Parkinson's disease-associated mutations.
11331421|t|alpha-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, a neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Two alpha-synuclein mutations, Ala53Thr and Ala30Pro, are associated with early onset, familial forms of the disease. Recently, synphilin-1, a protein found to interact with alpha-synuclein by yeast two hybrid techniques, was detected in Lewy bodies. In this study we report the interaction of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 in human neuroglioma cells using a sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. We demonstrate that the C-terminus of alpha-synuclein is closely associated with the C-terminus of synphilin-1. A weak interaction occurs between the N-terminus of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1. The familial Parkinson's disease associated mutations of alpha-synuclein (Ala53Thr and Ala30Pro) also demonstrate a strong interaction between their C-terminal regions and synphilin-1. However, compared with wild-type alpha-synuclein, significantly less energy transfer occurs between the C-terminus of Ala53Thr alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1, suggesting that the Ala53Thr mutation alters the conformation of alpha-synuclein in relation to synphilin-1.

18201104|t|Different conformational switches underlie the calmodulin-dependent modulation of calcium pumps and channels.
18201104|t|We have used fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the structure of calmodulin (CaM) bound with CaM-binding sequences of either the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase or the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) calcium release channel. Following derivatization with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide at engineered sites (T34C and T110C) within the N- and C-domains of CaM, contact interactions between these opposing domains of CaM resulted in excimer fluorescence that permits us to monitor conformational states of bound CaM. Complementary measurements take advantage of the unique conserved Trp within CaM-binding sequences that functions as a hydrophobic anchor in CaM binding and permits measurements of both a local and global peptide structure. We find that CaM binds with high affinity in a collapsed structure to the CaM-binding sequences of both the Ca-ATPase and RyR1, resulting in excimer formation that is indicative of contact interactions between the N- and the C-domains of CaM in complex with these CaM-binding peptides. There is a 4-fold larger amount of excimer formation for CaM bound to the CaM-binding sequence of the Ca-ATPase in comparison to RyR1, indicating a closer structural coupling between CaM domains in this complex. Prior to CaM association, the CaM-binding sequences of the Ca-ATPase and RyR1 are conformationally disordered. Upon CaM association, the CaM-binding sequence of the Ca-ATPase assumes a highly ordered structure. In comparison, the CaM-binding sequence of RyR1 remains conformationally disordered irrespective of CaM binding. These results suggest an important role for interdomain contact interactions between the opposing domains of CaM in stabilizing the structure of the peptide complex. The substantially different structural responses associated with CaM binding to Ca-ATPase and RyR1 indicates a plasticity in their respective binding mechanisms that accomplishes different physical mechanisms of allosteric regulation, involving either the dissociation of a C-terminal regulatory domain necessary for pump activation or the modulation of intersubunit interactions to diminish RyR1 channel activity.

17300802|t|Insight into catalysis of a unique GTPase reaction by a combined biochemical and FTIR approach.
17300802|t|Rap1 and Rap2 are the only small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily that do not use glutamine for GTP hydrolysis. Moreover, Rap1GAP, which stimulates the GTPase reaction of Rap1 10(5)-fold, does not have the classical "arginine finger" like RasGAP but presumably, introduces an asparagine residue into the active site. Here, we address the requirements of this unique reaction in detail by combining various biochemical methods, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, stopped-flow and time-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The fluorescence spectroscopic assay monitors primarily protein-protein interaction steps, while FTIR resolves simultaneously the elementary steps of functional groups labor-free, but it is less sensitive and needs higher concentrations. Combining both methods allows us to distinguish weather mechanistic defects caused by mutation are due to affinity or due to functionality. We show that several mutations of Asn290 block catalysis. Some of the mutants, however, still form a complex with Rap1*GDP in the presence of BeF(x) but not AlF(x), supporting the notion that fluoride complexes are indicators of the ground versus transition state. Mutational analysis also shows that Thr61 is not required for catalysis. While replacement of Thr61 of Rap1 by Leu eliminates GTPase activation by Rap1GAP, the T61A and T61Q mutants have only a minor effect on catalysis, but change the relative rates of cleavage and (P(i)(-)) release. While Rap1GAP(N290A) is completely inactive on wild-type Rap1, it can act on Rap1(T61Q), arguing that Asn290 in trans has a role in catalysis similar to that of the intrinsic Gln in Ras and Rho. Finally, since FTIR works at high, and thus mostly saturating, concentrations, it can clearly separate effects on affinity from purely catalytic modifications, showing that Arg388, conserved between RapGAPs and mutated in the homologous RheBGAP Tuberin, affects binding affinity severely but has no effect on the cleavage reaction itself.

7539802|t|Identification of the major phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C in kit/stem cell factor receptor in vitro and in intact cells.
7539802|t|The c-kit-encoded tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (Kit/SCFR) is crucial for the development of hematopoietic cells, melanoblasts, and germ cells. Ligand stimulation of Kit/SCFR leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. We recently showed, that protein kinase C (PKC) acts in an SCF-stimulated negative feedback loop, which controls Kit/SCFR tyrosine kinase activity and modulates the cellular responses to SCF (Blume-Jensen, P., Siegbahn, A., Stabel, S., Heldin, C.-H., and Rönnstrand, L. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4199-4209). We present here the identification of the major phosphorylation sites for PKC in Kit/SCFR. Two serine residues in the kinase insert, Ser-741 and Ser-746, are PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in vivo and account for all phosphorylation by PKC in vitro. Together they comprise more than 60% of the total SCF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation in living cells and 85-90% of its phosphorylation in resting cells. Two additional serine residues, Ser-821 close to the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site in the kinase domain and Ser-959 in the carboxyl terminus are SCF-stimulated PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites. However, they are not phosphorylated directly by PKC-alpha in vitro. Both specific receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and specific receptor-associated phosphatidylinositide 3'-kinase activity was increased approximately 2-fold in response to SCF in PAE cells stably expressing Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A). Furthermore, the kinase activity of Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A) toward an exogenous substrate was increased, which was reflected as a decreased Km and an increased Vmax, in accordance with the negative regulatory role of PKC on Kit/SCFR signaling.

9003773|t|Specific cleavage of the retinoblastoma protein by an ICE-like protease in apoptosis.
9003773|t|Interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme-like (ICE-like) proteases are important mediators of apoptosis in diverse cell types and organisms. However, the role of these proteases in apoptosis cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of the physiological functions of their known substrates. Here we show that the C-terminal 42 amino acid peptide of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, an important cell cycle regulator with a known anti-apoptotic function, is specifically cleaved off by an ICE-like protease in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Cleavage of Rb induced by TNF was blocked in vivo and in vitro by two specific inhibitors of ICE-like proteases, and in vitro by a point mutation (Asp886 to Ala) within the ICE-like protease cleavage site of Rb, (883)DEAD(886). An antibody raised against the C-terminal 15 amino acid peptide of Rb recognized the full-length but not the cleaved form of Rb. The extent of Rb cleavage correlated directly with TNF-induced apoptosis in all tumour cell lines examined. Cleaved Rb bound cyclin D3 and inhibited the transcriptional activity of E2F-1, but failed to bind to the regulatory protein MDM2, which has been implicated in apoptosis. As Rb suppresses cell death and its C-terminus has important regulatory functions, our results suggest that Rb cleavage is an important event in apoptosis.

16547100|t|The adaptor protein soc-1/Gab1 modifies growth factor receptor output in Caenorhabditis elegans.
16547100|t|Previous genetic analysis has shown that dos/soc-1/Gab1 functions positively in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-stimulated Ras/Map kinase signaling through the recruitment of csw/ptp-2/Shp2. Using sensitized assays in Caenorhabditis elegans for let-23/Egfr and daf-2/InsR (insulin receptor-like) signaling, it is shown that soc-1/Gab1 inhibits phospholipase C-gamma (PLCgamma) and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling. Furthermore, as well as stimulating Ras/Map kinase signaling, soc-1/Gab1 stimulates a poorly defined signaling pathway that represses class 2 daf-2 phenotypes. In addition, it is shown that SOC-1 binds the C-terminal SH3 domain of SEM-5. This binding is likely to be functional as the sem-5(n2195)G201R mutation, which disrupts SOC-1 binding, behaves in a qualitatively similar manner to a soc-1 null allele in all assays for let-23/Egfr and daf-2/InsR signaling that were examined. Further genetic analysis suggests that ptp-2/Shp2 mediates the negative function of soc-1/Gab1 in PI3K-mediated signaling, as well as the positive function in Ras/Map kinase signaling. Other effectors of soc-1/Gab1 are likely to inhibit PLCgamma-mediated signaling and stimulate the poorly defined signaling pathway that represses class 2 daf-2 phenotypes. Thus, the recruitment of soc-1/Gab1, and its effectors, into the RTK-signaling complex modifies the cellular response by enhancing Ras/Map kinase signaling while inhibiting PI3K and PLCgamma-mediated signaling.

7505116|t|Association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with an essential erythropoietin receptor subdomain.
7505116|t|Using an active, HAI epitope-tagged form of the murine erythropoietin (EPO) receptor and via direct coimmunoprecipitation, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (p85/PI3-K) is shown to associate with the EPO receptor in transfected FDC-P1 cell lines. Coimmunoprecipitation of p85 with epitope-tagged EPO receptors was observed initially in FDC-HER cells labeled metabolically with [32P]orthophosphate, and association of these factors was confirmed by Western analyses of receptor immunoprecipitates using p85 antiserum. Interestingly, this association occurred in the absence of ligand, and exposure of FDC-HER cells to EPO did not detectably affect levels of receptor-associated p85 or overall levels of p85 phosphorylation. However, EPO was observed to stimulated the rapid formation of phosphatidylinositol 32P-phosphate in FDC-HER and FDC-ER cells. Through baculovirus-mediated expression of epitope-tagged EPO receptor forms in SF9 cells, domains for p85 association were mapped. Analyses of receptor forms with cytosolic truncations and deletions delineated a candidate subdomain for p85 binding to an essential extended box-2 region (P329-E374; including a putative motif for SH2 binding, Y343LVL). These findings extend a mechanistic alignment between the EPO receptor and protein tyrosine kinase-encoding receptors that likewise activate PI3-K, and expand the importance of further defining pathways to PI3-K activation.

15282306|t|Phosphorylation of Y845 on the epidermal growth factor receptor mediates binding to the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit II.
15282306|t|When co-overexpressed, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Src cooperate to cause synergistic increases in EGF-induced DNA synthesis, soft agar colony growth, and tumor formation in nude mice. This synergy is dependent upon c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of a unique tyrosine on the EGFR, namely, tyrosine 845 (Y845). Phenylalanine substitution of Y845 (Y845F) was found to inhibit EGF-induced DNA synthesis without affecting the catalytic activity of the receptor or its ability to phosphorylate Shc or activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that synergism may occur through alternate signaling pathways mediated by phosphorylated Y845 (pY845). One such pathway involves the transcription factor Stat5b. Here we describe another pathway that involves cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CoxII). CoxII was identified as a specific binding partner of a pY845-containing peptide in a phage display screen. EGF-dependent binding of CoxII to the wild type but not to the mutant Y845F-EGFR was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This association also required the kinase activity of c-Src. Confocal microscopy, as well as biochemical fractionation, indicated that the EGFR translocates to the mitochondria after EGF stimulation, where it colocalizes with CoxII. Such translocation required the catalytic activity of the receptor but not phosphorylation of Y845. However, ectopic expression of the Y845F-EGFR prevented the EGF from protecting MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells from adriamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas two mutants of Stat5b, a dominant-interfering mutant (DNstat5b) and a tyrosine mutation at 699 (Y699F-Stat5b) did not. Taken together, these data suggest that, through the ability of EGFR to translocate to the mitochondria, the binding of proteins such as CoxII to pY845 on the EGFR may positively regulate survival pathways that contribute to oncogenesis.

17223698|t|The hinge region between two ubiquitin-like domains destabilizes recombinant ISG15 in solution.
17223698|t|Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 mediates antiviral responses and also is upregulated within the endometrium in response to the developing embryo during early pregnancy. Structurally, ISG15 resembles two ubiquitin domains (30% identical) that are separated by a hinge region. Recombinant (r) bovISG15 is not stable in solution. It was hypothesized that the hinge region contributed to the instability of rbovISG15. Within 24 h of dialysis, rbovISG15 formed complexes as detected by reducing and denaturing SDS-PAGE. However, chemical perturbations of cysteine prevented formation of rbovISG15 complexes over time. Furthermore, a site-directed mutant of rbovISG15 (Cys80Ser) was isomeric and more stable than rbovISG15. Neither wild-type nor mutant rbovISG15 was able to interact with the ISG15 E1 initiating enzyme, UBE1L, in an in vitro pull-down assay. Ovine (ov) ISG15 has three additional amino acids within the hinge region that were hypothesized to increase stability and the degree of interaction with UBE1L because of increased separation of the ubiquitin-like domains. Over time in solution, rovISG15 the level of rovISG15 secondary structure was diminished, whereas the Cys80Ser rovISG15 structure did not change. A GST-Cys80Ser rovISG15 fusion protein had increased structural stability and enhanced protein-protein interaction with UBE1L after dialysis for 48 h, when compared to the GST-rovISG15 fusion protein or rbovISG15. Models of bovISG15, Cys80Ser bovISG15, and ovISG15 were constructed, which confirmed that the hinge region between the two ubiquitin domains destabilizes rbovISG15 in solution.

11180407|t|Wild-type p53 inhibits protein kinase CK2 activity.
11180407|t|The growth suppressor protein p53 and the protein kinase CK2 are both implicated in cellular growth regulation. We previously found that p53 binds to protein kinase CK2 via its regulatory beta-subunit. In the present study, we analyzed the consequences of the binding of p53 to CK2 for the enzymatic activity of CK2 in vitro and in vivo. We found that the carboxy-terminus of p53 which is a potent transforming agent stimulated CK2 activity whereas full length wild-type p53 which is a growth suppressor inhibited the activity of protein kinase CK2. Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 by p53 was dose-dependent and was seen for various CK2 substrates. Experiments with heat-denatured p53 and the conformational mutant p53(R175H) revealed that an intact conformation of p53 seemed to be necessary. Transfection of wild-type and of mutant p53 into p53-/- cells showed that the inhibition of p53 on CK2 activity was also detectable in intact cells and specific for wild-type p53 indicating that the growth suppressing function of p53 might at least be partially achieved by down-regulation of protein kinase CK2.

7499408|t|Inhibition of Ras/Raf interaction by anti-oncogenic mutants of neurofibromin, the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene product, in cell-free systems.
7499408|t|The neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene encodes a protein, neurofibromin, containing GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD) that stimulates intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras protein. By screening a randomly mutagenized NF1-GRD library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two NF1-GRD mutants (NF201 and NF204) with single amino acid substitutions, which suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of the RAS2(G19V) mutant. The NF1-GRD mutants also suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 6706-6710). In this paper, we investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of the transforming Ras-specific function by the NF1-GRD mutants in mammalian cells. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras.guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with Raf at several times lower concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras.GTP gamma S is approximately 5-10 times higher than the wild type. These results suggest that the mutant NF1-GRDs tightly bind to an oncogenic Ras in its GTP-bound active conformation and block the interaction between Ras and its effector, Raf.

8665852|t|Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by interaction with Ras and by point mutation.
8665852|t|We have reported previously that Ras interacts with the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in a GTP-dependent manner. The affinity of the interaction of Ras-GTP with p85alpha/p110alpha is shown here to be approximately 150 nM. The site of interaction on the p110alpha and beta isoforms of PI 3-kinase lies between amino acid residues 133 and 314. A point mutation in this region, K227E, blocks the GTP-dependent interaction of PI 3-kinase p110alpha with Ras in vitro and the ability of Ras to activate PI 3-kinase in intact cells. In addition, this mutation elevates the basal activity of PI 3-kinase in intact cells, suggesting a direct influence of the Ras binding site on the catalytic activity of PI 3-kinase. Using an in vitro reconstitution assay, it is shown that the interaction of Ras-GTP, but not Ras-GDP, with PI 3-kinase leads to an increase in its enzymatic activity. This stimulation is synergistic with the effect of tyrosine phosphopeptide binding to p85, particularly at suboptimal peptide concentrations. These data show that PI 3-kinase is regulated by a number of mechanisms, and that Ras contributes to the activation of this lipid kinase synergistically with tyrosine kinases.

16311512|t|Regulation of the antioncogenic Chk2 kinase by the oncogenic Wip1 phosphatase.
16311512|t|The antioncogenic Chk2 kinase plays a crucial role in DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoint regulation. Here we show that Chk2 associates with the oncogenic protein Wip1 (wild-type p53-inducible phosphatase 1) (PPM1D), a p53-inducible protein phosphatase. Phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine68 (Thr68), a critical event for Chk2 activation, which is normally induced by DNA damage or overexpression of Chk2, is inhibited by expression of wild-type (WT), but not a phosphatase-deficient mutant (D314A) of Wip1 in cultured cells. Furthermore, an in vitro phosphatase assay revealed that Wip1 (WT), but not Wip1 (D314A), dephosphorylates Thr68 on phosphorylated Chk2 in vitro, resulting in the inhibition of Chk2 kinase activity toward glutathione S-transferase-Cdc25C. Moreover, inhibition of Wip1 expression by RNA interference results in abnormally sustained Thr68 phosphorylation of Chk2 and increased susceptibility of cells in response to DNA damage, indicating that Wip1 acts as a negative regulator of Chk2 in response to DNA damage.

24747173|t|The role of ANK interactions with MYBBP1a and SPHK1 in catabolic events of articular chondrocytes.
24747173|t|OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of progressive ankylosis protein (ANK)/Myb-binding protein 1a (MYBBP1a) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) interactions in catabolic events of articular chondrocytes. METHOD: ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation. To determine the role of these interactions in catabolic events of articular chondrocytes, ank/ank and wild type (WT) mouse chondrocytes transfected with full-length or mutant ank expression vectors (EVs) or femoral heads were treated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in the absence or presence of SPHK inhibitor. Catabolic marker mRNA levels were analyzed by real time PCR; proteoglycan loss using safranin O staining and MMP-13 immunostaining were determined in femoral head explants; NF-κB activity was determined by transfecting chondrocytes with an NF-κB-specific luciferase reporter and analyzing nuclear translocation of p65 by immunoblotting; MYBBP1a nuclear or cytoplasmic amounts were determined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The ANK N-terminal region interacted with SPHK1, whereas a cytoplasmic C-terminal loop interacted with MYBBP1a. Lack of ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions in ank/ank chondrocytes resulted in increased MYBBP1a nuclear amounts and decreased SPHK1 activity, and consequently decreased NF-κB activity, catabolic marker mRNA levels, proteoglycan loss, and MMP-13 immunostaining in IL-1β-treated articular chondrocytes or femoral heads. Transfection with full-length ank EV reduced nuclear MYBBP1a amounts and fully restored SPHK and NF-κB activities in IL-1β-treated ank/ank chondrocytes, whereas transfection with P5L or F376del mutant ank reduced nuclear MYBBP1a or increased SPHK activity, respectively, and consequently either transfection only partially restored NF-κB activity. CONCLUSION: ANK/MYBBP1a and SPHK1 interactions stimulate catabolic events in IL-1β-mediated cartilage degradation.

11069923|t|Identification of residues in the N-terminal domain of the Yersinia tyrosine phosphatase that are critical for substrate recognition.
11069923|t|YopH is a 468-amino acid protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is produced by pathogenic Yersinia species. YopH is translocated into host mammalian cells via a type III protein secretion system. Translocation of YopH into human epithelial cells results in dephosphorylation of p130(Cas) and paxillin, disruption of focal adhesions, and inhibition of integrin-mediated bacterial phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal 129 amino acids of YopH comprise a bifunctional domain. This domain binds to the SycH chaperone in Yersinia to orchestrate translocation and to tyrosine-phosphorylated target proteins in host cells to mediate substrate recognition. We used random mutagenesis in combination with the yeast two-hybrid system to identify residues in the YopH N-terminal domain that are involved in substrate-binding activity. Four single codon changes (Q11R, V31G, A33D, and N34D) were identified that interfered with binding of the YopH N-terminal domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130(Cas) but not to SycH. These mutations did not impair YopH translocation into HeLa cells infected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Introduction of the V31G substitution into catalytically inactive (substrate-trapping) forms of YopH interfered with the ability of these proteins to bind to p130(Cas) and to localize to focal adhesions in HeLa cells. In addition, the V31G substitution reduced the ability of catalytically active YopH to dephosphorylate target proteins in HeLa cells. These data indicate that the substrate- and SycH-binding activities of the YopH N-terminal domain can be separated and that the former activity is important for recognition and dephosphorylation of substrates by YopH in vivo.

11431330|t|Regulation of PTEN binding to MAGI-2 by two putative phosphorylation sites at threonine 382 and 383.
11431330|t|We have reported previously that the PTEN COOH-terminal 33 amino acids play a role in the maintenance of PTEN protein stability (Tolkacheva and Chan, Oncogene, 19: 680-689, 2000). By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two threonine residues within this COOH-terminal region at codon 382 and 383 that may be targets for phosphorylation events. Interestingly, PTEN mutants rendered phosphorylation-incompetent at these two sites, T382A/T383A, and were found to have drastically reduced expression in cultured cells. The enhanced degradation of PTEN was most likely mediated by the proteosome-dependent pathway, we have evidence that PTEN was polyubiquitinated. More interestingly, the non-phosphorylated forms of PTEN displayed significantly greater binding affinity than the wild-type protein to a previously identified PTEN interacting partner, MAGI-2/ARIP1. On the basis of all these data, we propose that PTEN recruitment to the cell-cell junction may be regulated through the phosphorylation of its COOH terminus.

16457665|t|Wild-type and mutant ferroportins do not form oligomers in transfected cells.
16457665|t|Ferroportin [FPN; Slc40a1 (solute carrier family 40, member 1)] is a transmembrane iron export protein expressed in macrophages and duodenal enterocytes. Heterozygous mutations in the FPN gene result in an autosomal dominant form of iron overload disorder, type-4 haemochromatosis. FPN mutants either have a normal iron export activity but have lost their ability to bind hepcidin, or are defective in their iron export function. The mutant protein has been suggested to act as a dominant negative over the wt (wild-type) protein by multimer formation. Using transiently transfected human epithelial cell lines expressing mouse FPN modified by the addition of a haemagglutinin or c-Myc epitope at the C-terminus, we show that the wtFPN is found at the plasma membrane and in Rab5-containing endosomes, as are the D157G and Q182H mutants. However, the delV162 mutant is mostly intracellular in HK2 cells (human kidney-2 cells) and partially addressed at the cell surface in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney 293 cells). In both cell types, it is partially associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and with Rab5-positive vesicles. However, this mutant is complex-glycosylated like the wt protein. D157G and G323V mutants have a defective iron export capacity as judged by their inability to deplete the intracellular ferritin content, whereas Q182H and delV162 have normal iron export function and probably have lost their capacity to bind hepcidin. In co-transfection experiments, the delV162 mutant does not co-localize with the wtFPN, does not prevent its normal targeting to the plasma membrane and cannot be immunoprecipitated in the same complex, arguing against the formation of FPN hetero-oligomers.

20361980|t|What makes Ras an efficient molecular switch: a computational, biophysical, and structural study of Ras-GDP interactions with mutants of Raf.
20361980|t|Ras is a small GTP-binding protein that is an essential molecular switch for a wide variety of signaling pathways including the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In the GTP-bound state, Ras can interact with its effectors, triggering various signaling cascades in the cell. In the GDP-bound state, Ras looses its ability to bind to known effectors. The interaction of the GTP-bound Ras (Ras(GTP)) with its effectors has been studied intensively. However, very little is known about the much weaker interaction between the GDP-bound Ras (Ras(GDP)) and Ras effectors. We investigated the factors underlying the nucleotide-dependent differences in Ras interactions with one of its effectors, Raf kinase. Using computational protein design, we generated mutants of the Ras-binding domain of Raf kinase (Raf) that stabilize the complex with Ras(GDP). Most of our designed mutations narrow the gap between the affinity of Raf for Ras(GTP) and Ras(GDP), producing the desired shift in binding specificity towards Ras(GDP). A combination of our best designed mutation, N71R, with another mutation, A85K, yielded a Raf mutant with a 100-fold improvement in affinity towards Ras(GDP). The Raf A85K and Raf N71R/A85K mutants were used to obtain the first high-resolution structures of Ras(GDP) bound to its effector. Surprisingly, these structures reveal that the loop on Ras previously termed the switch I region in the Ras(GDP).Raf mutant complex is found in a conformation similar to that of Ras(GTP) and not Ras(GDP). Moreover, the structures indicate an increased mobility of the switch I region. This greater flexibility compared to the same loop in Ras(GTP) is likely to explain the natural low affinity of Raf and other Ras effectors to Ras(GDP). Our findings demonstrate that an accurate balance between a rigid, high-affinity conformation and conformational flexibility is required to create an efficient and stringent molecular switch.

19114660|t|PKC eta regulates occludin phosphorylation and epithelial tight junction integrity.
19114660|t|PKC eta is expressed predominantly in the epithelial tissues; however, its role in the regulation of epithelial tight junctions (TJs) is unknown. We present evidence that PKC eta phosphorylates occludin on threonine residues (T403 and T404) and plays a crucial role in the assembly and/or maintenance of TJs in Caco-2 and MDCK cell monolayers. Inhibition of PKC eta by specific pseudo substrate inhibitor or knockdown of PKC eta by specific shRNA disrupts the junctional distribution of occludin and ZO-1 and compromises the epithelial barrier function. Expression of dominant negative, PKC eta(K394R) disrupts the TJ and barrier function, whereas wild-type PKC eta and constitutively active PKC eta(A161E) enhance the TJ integrity. Inhibition and knockdown of PKC eta or expression of PKC eta(K394R) induce dephosphorylation of occludin on threonine residues, whereas active PKC eta elevates occludin phosphorylation. PKC eta directly interacts with the C-terminal domain of occludin and phosphorylates it on highly conserved T403 and T404. T403/404A mutations result in the loss of occludin's ability to localize at the TJs, whereas T403/404D mutations attenuates the PKC eta inhibitor-mediated redistribution of occludin from the intercellular junctions. These results reveal an important mechanism of epithelial TJ regulation by PKC eta.

16365047|t|Prolyl-isomerase Pin1 accumulates in lewy bodies of parkinson disease and facilitates formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions.
16365047|t|Parkinson disease (PD) is a relatively common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs), which are cytoplasmic inclusions containing aggregates of alpha-synuclein. Although certain post-translational modifications of alpha-synuclein and its related proteins are implicated in the genesis of LBs, the specific molecular mechanisms that both regulate these processes and initiate subsequent inclusion body formation are not yet well understood. We demonstrate in our current study, however, that the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 localizes to the LBs in PD brain tissue and thereby enhances the formation of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue from PD patients revealed that Pin1 localizes to 50-60% of the LBs that show an intense halo pattern resembling that of alpha-synuclein. By utilizing a cellular model of alpha-synuclein aggregation, we also demonstrate that, whereas Pin1 overexpression facilitates the formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions, dominant-negative Pin1 expression significantly suppresses this process. Consistent with these observations, Pin1 overexpression enhances the protein half-life and insolubility of alpha-synuclein. Finally, we show that Pin1 binds synphilin-1, an alpha-synuclein partner, via its Ser-211-Pro and Ser-215-Pro motifs, and enhances its interaction with alpha-synuclein, thus likely facilitating the formation of alpha-synuclein inclusions. These results indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization plays a pivotal role in a post-translational modification pathway for alpha-synuclein aggregation and in the resultant Lewy body formations in PD.

16376338|t|Protein kinase A phosphorylates and regulates dimerization of 14-3-3 epsilon.
16376338|t|Recognition of phosphorylated serine/threonine-containing motifs by 14-3-3 depends on the dimerization of 14-3-3. However, the molecular cues that control 14-3-3 dimerization are not well understood. In order to identify proteins that control 14-3-3 dimerization, we analyzed proteins that have effects on 14-3-3 dimerization and report that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates 14-3-3zeta at a specific residue (Ser58). Phosphorylation by PKA leads to modulation of 14-3-3zeta dimerization and affect its interaction with partner proteins. Substitution of Ser58 to Ala completely abolished phosphorylation of 14-3-3zeta by PKA. A phospho-mimic mutant of 14-3-3zeta, Ser58 to Glu substitution, failed to form homodimers, showed reduced interaction with 14-3-3epsilon and p53, and could not enhance transcriptional activity of p53. Moreover, activation of PKA decreases and inhibition of PKA increases the dimerization of 14-3-3zeta and the functional interaction of 14-3-3zeta with p53. Therefore, our results suggest that PKA is a new member of protein kinases that can phosphorylate and impair the function of 14-3-3.

11478883|t|Recognition of fibronectin by the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3 involves an extended interface with multiple electrostatic interactions.
11478883|t|Normal platelet function is dependent on the ability of integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) to interact with components of the subendothelial matrix, such as fibronectin (Fn), exposed at sites of vascular injury. Studies using synthetic peptides derived from human Fn sequences Asp(1373)--Thr(1383) and Arg(1493)--Asp(1495) have suggested a role for both the 9th (3fn9) and 10th (3fn10) type III repeats of this ligand in binding to alpha IIb beta 3. In this study, we have taken a charge-to-alanine mutagenesis approach to evaluate the importance of these sites, and other charged residues, within the context of recombinant 3fn9--10 modules for binding to alpha IIb beta 3. To identify residues that are involved in Fn binding to alpha IIb beta 3, recombinantly expressed 3fn9--10 module pairs with alanine substitutions introduced into each of the 38 charged residues were individually assayed for the ability to inhibit Fn binding to purified alpha IIb beta 3. Substitutions at Fn residues Arg(1493) and Asp(1495) of the RGD sequence were found to have the greatest effect on alpha IIb beta 3 binding, as expected. However, Fn residues Arg(1369), Arg(1371), Arg(1379), Arg(1445), and Arg(1448) were needed for optimal interaction of the 3fn9--10 module pair with alpha IIb beta 3. All Fn residues found to affect binding of 3fn9--10 to alpha IIb beta 3 are located on the same face and extend from the surface of the molecule. Additionally, the epitopes for two anti-Fn monoclonal antibodies that inhibit binding of this ligand to alpha IIb beta 3 were found to overlap the sites identified. These results demonstrate that alpha IIb beta 3--Fn binding involves multiple electrostatic interactions.

14684752|t|Regulation of interleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) phosphorylation and signaling by iota protein kinase C.
14684752|t|We have previously shown that the activity of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) is required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of NF-kappaB and cell survival ((2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28010-28018). Herein we demonstrate that NGF induces co-association of IRAK with atypical protein kinase C iota (PKC) and that the iota PKC.IRAK complex is recruited to the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Recruitment of IRAK to the receptor was dependent upon the activity of the iota PKC. Moreover, transfection of kinase-dead iota PKC blocked both NGF- and IL-1-induced IRAK activation and the activity of NF-kappaB. Hence, iota PKC lies upstream of IRAK in the kappaB pathway. Examining the primary structure of IRAK, we identified three putative PKC phosphorylation sites; iota PKC selectively phosphorylated peptide 1 (RTAS) within the death domain domain at Thr66, which is highly conserved among all IRAK family members. Mutation of Thr66 to Ala impaired the autokinase activity of IRAK and reduced its association with iota PKC but not TRAF6, resulting in impaired NGF- as well as IL-1-induced NF-kappaB activation. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanism whereby IRAK regulates the kappaB pathway and reveal that IRAK is a substrate of iota PKC.

15831449|t|SPBP is a phosphoserine-specific repressor of estrogen receptor alpha.
15831449|t|Multiple signaling pathways stimulate the activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) by direct phosphorylation within its N-terminal activation function 1 (AF1). How phosphorylation affects AF1 activity remains poorly understood. We performed a phage display screen for human proteins that are exclusively recruited to the phosphorylated form of AF1 and found the stromelysin-1 platelet-derived growth factor-responsive element-binding protein (SPBP). In a purified system, SPBP bound only the in vitro-phosphorylated form of the ERalpha AF1 or the phosphoserine mimic S118E, and the interaction domain could be mapped to a 42-amino-acid fragment of SPBP. In cells, SPBP preferentially interacted with liganded and phosphorylated ERalpha. Functionally, SPBP behaved as a repressor of activated ERalpha, which extends its previously demonstrated roles as a DNA binding transactivation factor and coactivator of other transcription factors. By targeting the phosphorylated form of AF1, SPBP may contribute to attenuating and fine-tuning ERalpha activity. A functional consequence is that SPBP inhibits the proliferation of ERalpha-dependent but not ERalpha-independent breast cancer cell lines, mirroring a reported negative correlation with the ERalpha status of breast tumors.

10884387|t|Regulation of the yeast transcriptional factor PHO2 activity by phosphorylation.
10884387|t|The induction of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene PHO5 expression is mediated by transcriptional factors PHO2 and PHO4. PHO4 protein has been reported to be phosphorylated and inactivated by a cyclin-CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) complex, PHO80-PHO85. We report here that PHO2 can also be phosphorylated. A Ser-230 to Ala mutation in the consensus sequence (SPIK) recognized by cdc2/CDC28-related kinase in PHO2 protein led to complete loss of its ability to activate the transcription of PHO5 gene. Further investigation showed that the Pro-231 to Ser mutation inactivated PHO2 protein as well, whereas the Ser-230 to Asp mutation did not affect PHO2 activity. Since the PHO2 Asp-230 mutant mimics Ser-230-phosphorylated PHO2, we postulate that only phosphorylated PHO2 protein could activate the transcription of PHO5 gene. Two hybrid assays showed that yeast CDC28 could interact with PHO2. CDC28 immunoprecipitate derived from the YPH499 strain grown under low phosphate conditions phosphorylated GST-PHO2 in vitro. A phosphate switch regulates the transcriptional activation activity of PHO2, and mutations of the (SPIK) site affect the transcriptional activation activity of PHO2 and the interaction between PHO2 and PHO4. BIAcore(R) analysis indicated that the negative charge in residue 230 of PHO2 was sufficient to help PHO2 interact with PHO4 in vitro.

11598113|t|The conserved sites for the FK506-binding proteins in ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are structurally and functionally different.
11598113|t|We compared the interaction of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) with the type 3 ryanodine receptor (RyR3) and with the type 1 and type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3), using a quantitative GST-FKBP12 and GST-FKBP12.6 affinity assay. We first characterized and mapped the interaction of the FKBPs with the RyR3. GST-FKBP12 as well as GST-FKBP12.6 were able to bind approximately 30% of the solubilized RyR3. The interaction was completely abolished by FK506, strengthened by the addition of Mg(2+), and weakened in the absence of Ca(2+) but was not affected by the addition of cyclic ADP-ribose. By using proteolytic mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we pinpointed Val(2322), located in the central modulatory domain of the RyR3, as a critical residue for the interaction of RyR3 with FKBPs. Substitution of Val(2322) for leucine (as in IP(3)R1) or isoleucine (as in RyR2) decreased the binding efficiency and shifted the selectivity to FKBP12.6; substitution of Val(2322) for aspartate completely abolished the FKBP interaction. Importantly, the occurrence of the valylprolyl residue as alpha-helix breaker was an important determinant of FKBP binding. This secondary structure is conserved among the different RyR isoforms but not in the IP(3)R isoforms. A chimeric RyR3/IP(3)R1, containing the core of the FKBP12-binding site of IP(3)R1 in the RyR3 context, retained this secondary structure and was able to interact with FKBPs. In contrast, IP(3)Rs did not interact with the FKBP isoforms. This indicates that the primary sequence in combination with the local structural environment plays an important role in targeting the FKBPs to the intracellular Ca(2+)-release channels. Structural differences in the FKBP-binding site of RyRs and IP(3)Rs may contribute to the occurrence of a stable interaction between RyR isoforms and FKBPs and to the absence of such interaction with IP(3)Rs.

Mutation of the Trk-A residue Tyr490 to phenylalanine prevents the association with Shc, while similar mutations at Tyr751 or Tyr785 are reported to prevent interaction of Trk-A with the p85 subunit of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase and phospholipase C-gamma 1, respectively. The strong and sustained activation of p42 and p44 mitogen-activated-protein kinases induced by PDGF-B/B in PC12/PT-R cells was unaffected by mutation of Tyr785 or Tyr751 to phenylalanine, but was smaller and transient after mutation of Tyr490, and almost abolished by the double mutation of Tyr490 and Tyr785. Mutation of Tyr490 reduced by 70% the PDGF-induced increase in inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies and greatly suppressed the PDGF-induced increase in the intracellular products of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase, while mutation of Tyr751 or Tyr785 had no effect. Mutation of Tyr785 (but not mutation of Tyr490 or Tyr751) abolished PDGF-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Mutation of Tyr490, alone or in combination with mutation of Tyr751 and Tyr785, had no effect on the PDGF-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). However, the activation of p70S6K by PDGF (or nerve growth factor), but not the activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase, was prevented by two structurally unrelated inhibitors of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase, wortmannin or LY294002. Our results demonstrate the following: (1) the phosphorylation of Tyr490 plays a major role in the activation of inositol phospholipid 3-kinase and formation of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids and confirm that the phosphorylation of Tyr 785 triggers the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 in vivo. (2) Tyr490 phosphorylation (but not inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activation) is also required for strong and sustained activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase and neuronal differentiation, while the smaller and more transient activation of mitogen-activated-protein kinase, produced by the activation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 is insufficient to trigger the neuronal differentiation of PT-R cells. (3) Inositol phospholipid 3-kinase is required for the activation of p70S6K, but only a small increase in inositol phospholipid 3-kinase activity and the level of 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids is required for maximal p70S6K activation.

21653319|t|Targeting RAD51 phosphotyrosine-315 to prevent unfaithful recombination repair in BCR-ABL1 leukemia.
21653319|t|Chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase (CML-CP) CD34(+) cells contain numerous DNA double-strand breaks whose unfaithful repair may contribute to chromosomal instability and disease progression to blast phase (CML-BP). These phenomena are often associated with the appearance of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 kinase mutants (eg, T315I) and overexpression of BCR-ABL1. Here we show that BCR-ABL1 (nonmutated and T315I mutant) promoted RAD51 recombinase-mediated unfaithful homeologous recombination repair (HomeoRR) in a dosage-dependent manner. BCR-ABL1 SH3 domain interacts with RAD51 proline-rich regions, resulting in direct phosphorylation of RAD51 on Y315 (pY315). RAD51(pY315) facilitates dissociation from the complex with BCR-ABL1 kinase, migrates to the nucleus, and enhances formation of the nuclear foci indicative of recombination sites. HomeoRR and RAD51 nuclear foci were strongly reduced by RAD51(Y315F) phosphorylation-less mutant. In addition, peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51(pY315) fragment, but not that with Y315F phosphorylation-less substitution, diminished RAD51 foci formation and inhibited HomeoRR in leukemia cells. In conclusion, we postulate that BCR-ABL1 kinase-mediated RAD51(pY315) promotes unfaithful HomeoRR in leukemia cells, which may contribute to accumulation of secondary chromosomal aberrations responsible for CML relapse and progression.

22193384|t|Binding of losartan to angiotensin AT1 receptors increases dopamine D1 receptor activation.
22193384|t|Signaling through both angiotensin AT1 receptors (AT1R) and dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) modulates renal sodium excretion and arterial BP. AT1R and D1R form heterodimers, but whether treatment with AT1R antagonists functionally modifies D1R via allosterism is unknown. In this study, the AT1R antagonist losartan strengthened the interaction between AT1R and D1R and increased expression of D1R on the plasma membrane in vitro. In rat proximal tubule cells that express endogenous AT1R and D1R, losartan increased cAMP generation. Losartan increased cAMP in HEK 293a cells transfected with both AT1R and D1R, but it did not increase cAMP in cells transfected with either receptor alone, suggesting that losartan induces D1R activation. Furthermore, losartan did not increase cAMP in HEK 293a cells expressing AT1R and mutant S397/S398A D1R, which disrupts the physical interaction between AT1R and D1R. In vivo, administration of a D1R antagonist significantly attenuated the antihypertensive effect of losartan in rats with renal hypertension. Taken together, these data imply that losartan might exert its antihypertensive effect both by inhibiting AT1R signaling and by enhancing D1R signaling.

26744328|t|Synphilin-1 attenuates mutant LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease models.
26744328|t|Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause autosomal-dominant Parkinsonism with pleomorphic pathology including deposits of aggregated protein and neuronal degeneration. The pathogenesis of LRRK2-linked Parkinson's disease (PD) is not fully understood. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that LRRK2 interacted with synphilin-1 (SP1), a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with α-synuclein and has implications in PD pathogenesis. LRRK2 interacted with the N-terminus of SP1 whereas SP1 predominantly interacted with the C-terminus of LRRK2, including kinase domain. Co-expression of SP1 with LRRK2 increased LRRK2-induced cytoplasmic aggregation in cultured cells. Moreover, SP1 also attenuated mutant LRRK2-induced toxicity and reduced LRRK2 kinase activity in cultured cells. Knockdown of SP1 by siRNA enhanced LRRK2 neuronal toxicity. In vivo Drosophila studies, co-expression of SP1 and mutant G2019S-LRRK2 in double transgenic Drosophila increased survival and improved locomotor activity. Expression of SP1 protects against G2019S-LRRK2-induced dopamine neuron loss and reduced LRRK2 phosphorylation in double transgenic fly brains. Our findings demonstrate that SP1 attenuates mutant LRRK2-induced PD-like phenotypes and plays a neural protective role.

7711031|t|Calmodulin binding sites of the skeletal, cardiac, and brain ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels: modulation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase?
7711031|t|In this study, we define calmodulin binding sites of skeletal, cardiac, and brain ryanodine receptor (RYR) Ca2+ channels. Cardiac and brain RYR peptides corresponding to the calmodulin binding sites present in the skeletal RYR [Menegazzi, P., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9078-9084] were synthesized, and their interaction with calmodulin was monitored by fluorescent techniques. The central portions of the skeletal, cardiac, and brain RYR protomers display one high (CaM1; Kd ranging between 2.7 and 10.2 nM) and one low affinity (CaM2; Kd ranging between 116 and 142 nM) calmodulin binding site. Depending on the RYR model having 4 or 12 transmembrane segments, a third calmodulin binding site (CaM3) was identified a few residues upstream from the putative transmembrane segment M1 or M5. Its affinity for calmodulin varied between the RYR isoforms: the cardiac RYR CaM3 displays a high affinity (9.09 +/- 1.0 nM, n = 5), while the skeletal and brain RYR CaM3 have low affinity, the lowest affinity being displayed by the brain isoform (234 +/- 39 nM, n = 3). The RYRs calmodulin binding site CaM1 encompasses the sequence Arg-His-Arg-Val(Ile)-Ser-Leu, which is phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of RYR PM1 peptides occurs on the Ser, corresponding to amino acid number 2919, 3020, and 3055 of the brain, cardiac, and skeletal RYR protomers, respectively. We found that phosphorylation of the RYR PM1 peptides was inhibited by calmodulin binding and that the formation of the PM1 peptide-calmodulin complex was inhibited by peptide phosphorylation. These data indicate that the effect of calmodulin binding to RYR CaM1 may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the Ser residue localized within the sequence Arg-His-Arg-Val(Ile)-Ser-Leu.

10995739|t|Insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation of the forkhead family transcription factor FKHRL1 is mediated by Akt kinase in PC12 cells.
10995739|t|The Forkhead family transcription factor FKHRL1, a mammalian homolog of DAF16 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, is an inducer of apoptosis in its unphosphorylated form and was recently reported as a substrate of Akt kinases. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is a potent stimulant of Akt kinase, leading to inhibition of the apoptotic pathway. In this study, we characterized the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 in PC12 cells and various neuronal cell types and examined the potential role of Akt in this regard. IGF-1 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 in PC12 cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin (0.25-2 microm) and LY294002 (12.5-100 microm), but not by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 microm) or the p70 S6 kinase pathway inhibitor rapamycin (50 nm), suggesting that the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by IGF-1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway. As observed for IGF-1, an in vitro kinase assay with purified active Akt kinase demonstrated that the kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at Thr(32) and Ser(253), leading to inhibition of its pro-apoptotic properties. Moreover, transient expression of constitutively active Akt (MS-Akt, where MS is a myristylation signal) increased the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, whereas the expression of kinase-dead Akt (M179A Akt) attenuated the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 induced by 10 nm IGF-1 in PC12 cells. Interestingly, FKHRL1 co-immunoprecipitated with Akt in PC12 cells, indicating that these two proteins can associate in these cells. As IGF-1 also induced the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 in primary cortical and cerebellar neuronal cultures, these data, taken together, demonstrate that IGF-1, acting via the PI3K/Akt kinase pathway, can regulate the phosphorylation of FKHRL1, leading to inhibition of this apoptotic transcription factor in neuronal cells.

11546794|t|Heregulin-dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt via the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor.
11546794|t|The ErbB2/ErbB3 heregulin co-receptor has been shown to couple to phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase in a heregulin-dependent manner. The recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase by this co-receptor is presumed to occur via its interaction with phosphorylated Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met (YXXM) motifs occurring in the ErbB3 C terminus. In this study, mutant ErbB3 receptor proteins expressed in COS7 cells were used to investigate PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathways activated by the ErbB2/ErbB3 co-receptor. We observed that a mutant ErbB3 protein with each of its six YXXM motifs containing a Tyr --> Phe substitution was unable to bind either the p85 regulatory or p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. However, restoration of a single YXXM motif was sufficient to mediate association with the PI 3-kinase holoenzyme, although at a lower level than wild-type ErbB3. When ErbB3 YXXM motifs were restored in pairs, evidence for cooperativity between two, those incorporating Tyr-1273 and Tyr-1286, was observed. Interestingly, we have shown that an apparent association of PI 3-kinase activity with ErbB2/Neu was due to the residual presence of ErbB3 in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates. The necessity of ErbB3 association with PI 3-kinase for downstream signaling to the effector kinase Akt was also investigated. Here, the heregulin-dependent translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation was observed in intact NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Recruitment of PI 3-kinase to ErbB3 was required for both activities, and it appeared that ErbB2 activation alone was not sufficient to activate PI 3-kinase signaling in these cells.

10669742|t|CIZ, a zinc finger protein that interacts with p130(cas) and activates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases.
10669742|t|p130(cas) (Cas) is a docking protein that contains an SH3 domain and multiple tyrosine residues. p130(cas) is located at focal adhesions, is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to integrin stimulation, and is thought to transmit signals, via c-Crk and other proteins, for the remodeling of actin stress fibers and cell movement. In a search for the ligands of the SH3 domain of p130(cas) by far-Western screening, we cloned a novel protein named CIZ (for Cas-interacting zinc finger protein). CIZ consists of the following: a putative leucine zipper; a serine/threonine-rich region; a proline-rich sequence; five, six, or eight Krüppel-type C(2)H(2) zinc fingers; and the glutamine-alanine repeat. CIZ binds Cas in cells and is located in the nucleus and at focal adhesions. We showed that CIZ is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, by using the transient interspecies heterokaryon formation assay. In order to search for the targets of CIZ in nucleus, we determined the DNA binding consensus of CIZ as (G/C)AAAAA(A) by cyclic amplification and selection of targets analysis. The consensus-like sequences are found in several promoters of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are the enzymes used to degrade the extracellular matrix proteins. CIZ binds to a consensus-like sequence in the MMP-1 (collagenase) promoter. Overexpression of CIZ upregulates the transcriptions from MMP-1, MMP-3 (stromelysin), and MMP-7 (matrilysin) promoters, and this transactivation was enhanced in the presence of Cas. Furthermore, the stable overexpression of CIZ promoted the production of MMP-7 in culture medium. In summary, CIZ, a novel zinc finger protein, binds Cas, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, and regulates the expression of MMPs.

26385096|t|GDF-5 can act as a context-dependent BMP-2 antagonist.
26385096|t|BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-5 are two related transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family members with important functions in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. BMP-2 is best known for its osteoinductive properties whereas GDF-5-as evident from its alternative name, cartilage derived morphogenetic protein 1-plays an important role in the formation of cartilage. In spite of these differences both factors signal by binding to the same subset of BMP receptors, raising the question how these different functionalities are generated. The largest difference in receptor binding is observed in the interaction with the type I receptor BMPR-IA. GDF-5, in contrast to BMP-2, shows preferential binding to the isoform BMPR-IB, which is abrogated by a single amino acid (A57R) substitution. The resulting variant, GDF-5 R57A, represents a "BMP-2 mimic" with respect to BMP receptor binding. In this study we thus wanted to analyze whether the two growth factors can induce distinct signals via an identically composed receptor. RESULTS: Unexpectedly and dependent on the cellular context, GDF-5 R57A showed clear differences in its activity compared to BMP-2. In ATDC-5 cells, both ligands induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression with similar potency. But in C2C12 cells, the BMP-2 mimic GDF-5 R57A (and also wild-type GDF-5) clearly antagonized BMP-2-mediated ALP expression, despite signaling in both cell lines occurring solely via BMPR-IA. The BMP-2- antagonizing properties of GDF-5 and GDF-5 R57A could also be observed in vivo when implanting BMP-2 and either one of the two GDF-5 ligands simultaneously at heterotopic sites. CONCLUSIONS: Although comparison of the crystal structures of the GDF-5 R57A:BMPR-IAEC- and BMP-2:BMPR-IAEC complex revealed small ligand-specific differences, these cannot account for the different signaling characteristics because the complexes seem identical in both differently reacting cell lines. We thus predict an additional component, most likely a not yet identified GDF-5-specific co-receptor, which alters the output of the signaling complexes. Hence the presence or absence of this component then switches GDF-5's signaling capabilities to act either similar to BMP-2 or as a BMP-2 antagonist. These findings might shed new light on the role of GDF-5, e.g., in cartilage maintenance and/or limb development in that it might act as an inhibitor of signaling events initiated by other BMPs.

10980193|t|ARL4, an ARF-like protein that is developmentally regulated and localized to nuclei and nucleoli.
10980193|t|ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that participate in both exocytic and endocytic vesicular transport pathways via mechanisms that are only partially understood. Although several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) are known, their biological functions remain unclear. To characterize its molecular properties, we cloned mouse and human ARL4 (mARL4 and hARL4) cDNA. The appearance of mouse ARL4 mRNA during embryonic development coincided temporally with the sequential formation of somites and the establishment of brain compartmentation. Using ARL4-specific antibody for immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that endogenous mARL4 in cultured Sertoli and neuroblastoma cells was mainly concentrated in nuclei. When expressed in COS7 cells, ARL4-T34N mutant, predicted to exist with GDP bound, was concentrated in nucleoli. Yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro protein-interaction assays showed that hARL4 interacted with importin-alpha through its C-terminal NLS region and that the interaction was not nucleotide-dependent. Like ARL2 and -3, recombinant hARL4 did not enhance cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. Its binding of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) was modified by phospholipid and detergent, and the N terminus of hARL4, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Our findings suggest that ARL4, with its distinctive nuclear/nucleolar localization and pattern of developmental expression, may play a unique role(s) in neurogenesis and somitogenesis during embryonic development and in the early stages of spermatogenesis in adults.

10608804|t|The adapter protein Crkl links Cbl to C3G after integrin ligation and enhances cell migration.
10608804|t|Crkl, an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein, is one of the major tyrosine phosphoproteins detected in cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Crkl binds to BCR/ABL through its N-terminal SH3 domain and is known to interact with several signaling proteins that have been implicated in integrin signaling, including Cbl, Cas, Hef-1, and paxillin. We have previously shown that overexpression of Crkl enhances adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins through beta(1) integrins. In this study, the effects of Crkl on spontaneous and chemokine-directed migration of the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 were examined. Full-length, SH2-, and SH3(N)-domain deletion mutants of Crkl were expressed transiently as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein. Successfully transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The ability of these cells to migrate across a fibronectin-coated membrane, either spontaneously or in response to the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1alpha, was determined. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein alone were not distinguishable from untransfected or mock transfected Ba/F3 cells. However, Ba/F3 cells overexpressing full-length Crkl were found to have an increase in spontaneous migration of 2.8 +/- 0.6-fold in seven independent assays. The enhancement of migration required both the SH2 domain and the N-terminal SH3 domain. Migration in response to stromal-derived factor-1alpha was not significantly enhanced by overexpression of Crkl. Overexpression of Crkii also augmented spontaneous migration but to a lesser degree than did Crkl. Because the SH2 domain was required for enhanced migration, we looked for changes in phosphotyrosine containing proteins coprecipitating with Crkl, but not Crkl DeltaSH2, after integrin cross-linking. Full-length Crkl, but not CrklDeltaSH2, coprecipitated with a single major tyrosine phosphoprotein with an M(r) of approximately 120 kDa, identified as Cbl. The major Crkl SH3-binding protein in these cells was found to be the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, C3G. Interestingly, overexpression of C3G also enhanced migration, suggesting that a Cbl-Crkl-C3G complex may be involved in migration signaling in Ba/F3 cells. These data suggest that Crkl is involved in signaling pathways that regulate migration, possibly through a complex with Cbl and C3G.

21508668|t|Restoring p53 active conformation by zinc increases the response of mutant p53 tumor cells to anticancer drugs.
21508668|t|Absence of p53 expression or expression of mutant p53 (mtp53) are common in human cancers and are associated with increased cancer resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. We previously reported that, in HIPK2 knockdown background, p53 undergoes misfolding with inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activities that correlate with increased chemoresistance, and that zinc rescues wild-type p53 activity. Zinc has a crucial role in the biology of p53, in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. In this study, we explored the role of zinc in p53 reactivation in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. We found that zinc re-established chemosensitivity in breast cancer SKBR3 (expressing R175H mutation) and glioblastoma U373MG (expressing R273H mutation) cell lines. Biochemical studies showed that zinc partly induced the transition of mutant p53 protein (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb240 antibody for mutant conformation) into a functional conformation (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb1620 antibody for wild-type conformation). Zinc-mediated p53 reactivation also reduced the mtp53/p73 interaction restoring both wtp53 and p73 binding to target gene promoters by ChIP assay with in vivo induction of wtp53 target gene expression, which rendered mutant p53 cells more prone to drug killing in vitro. Finally, zinc administration in U373MG tumor xenografts increased drug-induced tumor regression in vivo, which correlated with increased wild-type p53 protein conformation. These results show that the use of zinc might restore drug sensitivity and inhibit tumor growth by reactivating mutant p53.

12097319|t|p73beta is regulated by protein kinase Cdelta catalytic fragment generated in the apoptotic response to DNA damage.
12097319|t|Protein kinase C (PKC) delta is cleaved by caspase-3 to a kinase-active catalytic fragment (PKCdeltaCF) in the apoptotic response of cells to DNA damage. Expression of PKCdeltaCF contributes to the induction of apoptosis by mechanisms that are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate that PKCdeltaCF associates with p73beta, a structural and functional homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor. The results show that PKCdeltaCF phosphorylates the p73beta transactivation and DNA-binding domains. One PKCdeltaCF-phosphorylation site has been mapped to Ser-289 in the p73beta DNA-binding domain. PKCdeltaCF-mediated phosphorylation of p73beta is associated with accumulation of p73beta and induction of p73beta-mediated transactivation. By contrast, PKCdeltaCF-induced activation of p73beta is attenuated by mutating Ser-289 to Ala (S289A). The results also demonstrate that PKCdeltaCF stimulates p73beta-mediated apoptosis and that this response is attenuated with the p73beta(S289A) mutant. These findings demonstrate that cleavage of PKCdelta to PKCdeltaCF induces apoptosis by a mechanism in part dependent on PKCdeltaCF-mediated phosphorylation of the p73beta Ser-289 site.

14691576|t|Critical residues for ligand binding in blade 2 of the propeller domain of the integrin alphaIIb subunit.
14691576|t|Ligand binding to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is a key event of thrombus formation. The propeller domain of the alphaIIb subunit has been implicated in ligand binding. Recently, the ligand binding site of the alphaV propeller was determined by crystal structure analysis. However, the structural basis of ligand recognition by the alphaIIb propeller remains to be determined. In this study, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of all residues located in the loops extending above blades 2 and 4 of the alphaIIb propeller, which are spatially close to, but distinct from, the loops that contain the binding site for an RGD ligand in the crystal structure of the alphaV propeller. Replacement by alanine of Q111, H112 or N114 in the loop within the blade 2 (the W2:2-3 loop in the propeller model) abolished binding of a ligand-mimetic antibody and fibrinogen to alphaIIbbeta3 induced by different types of integrin activation including activation of alphaIIbbeta3 by beta3 cytoplasmic mutation. CHO cells stably expressing recombinant alphaIibbeta3 bearing Q111A, H112A or N114A mutation did not exhibit alphaIibbeta3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen. According to the crystal structure of alphaVbeta3, the alphaV residue corresponding to alphaIIbN114 is exposed on the integrin surface and close to the RGD binding site. These results suggest that the Q111, H112 and N114 residues in the loop within blade 2 of the alphaIIb propeller are critical for ligand binding, possibly because of direct interaction with ligands or modulation of the RGD binding pocket.

8561868|t|ras effector loop mutations that dissociate p120GAP and neurofibromin interactions.
8561868|t|ras proteins are positively regulated by nucleotide exchange factors and negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Two GAPs have been found in mammalian cells, p120GAP and neurofibromin, the product of the type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene. A library of substitutions in the effector loop region of ras in an Escherichia coli plasmid expression system was screened for c-Ha-ras species with altered GAP interactions. Several substitutions preferentially disrupted the interaction of ras with p120GAP as compared with the interaction with the recombinant GAP-related domain of neurofibromin (NF1-GRD). The most extreme example, Tyr32His, encoded a ras species that was unaffected by p120GAP but was stimulated normally by NF1-GRD. Tyr32His was weakly transforming in Rat2 cells. Tyr32His ras was primarily GDP-bound in quiescent Rat2 cells, although it rapidly associated with GTP after treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor. These results show that the NF1 product has less stringent requirements than p120GAP for ras effector domain structure and that negative regulation of ras can be achieved in rat fibroblasts by the product of NF1.

17332320|t|The Asn418-linked N-glycan of ErbB3 plays a crucial role in preventing spontaneous heterodimerization and tumor promotion.
17332320|t|ErbB2 and ErbB3, two members of the ErbB family, form a high-affinity heregulin coreceptor that elicits potent mitogenic and transforming signals, and clinical studies indicate that these receptors play an important role in tumor incidence and progression. To determine whether N-glycosylation is involved in the function of ErbB3, a series of human ErbB3 molecules devoid of N-glycans were prepared and transfected to Flp-In-CHO cells for stable expression. A cross-linking study showed that the Asn(418) to Gln mutant (N418Q) of ErbB3 underwent autodimerization without its ligand, heregulin. The wild-type or N418Q mutant of ErbB3 was next coexpressed with ErbB2 in Flp-In-CHO cells, and the effect of N-glycan on heterodimerization was examined. The N418Q mutant of ErbB3 was autodimerized with ErbB2 without ligand stimulation, and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation were promoted in the absence of heregulin. A cell proliferation assay and a soft agar colony formation assay showed that the N418Q mutant of ErbB3 coexpressed with ErbB2 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in an ERK- and Akt-dependent manner. The mutation also promoted the growth of tumors in athymic mice when injected s.c. These findings suggest that the Asn(418)-linked N-glycan in ErbB3 plays an essential role in regulating receptor heterodimerization with ErbB2 and might have an effect on transforming activity.

21626703|t|On the role of flexibility in protein-ligand interactions: the example of p53 tetramerization domain.
21626703|t|The recognition of protein surfaces by designed ligands has become an attractive approach in drug discovery. However, the variable nature and irregular behavior of protein surfaces defy this new area of research. The easy to understand "lock-and-key" model is far from being the ideal paradigm in biomolecular interactions and, hence, any new finding on how proteins and ligands behave in recognition events paves a step of the way. Herein, we illustrate a clear example on how an increase in flexibility of both protein and ligand can result in an increase in the stability of the macromolecular complex. The biophysical study of the interaction between a designed flexible tetraguanidinium-calix[4]arene and the tetramerization domain of protein p53 (p53TD) and its natural mutant p53TD-R337H shows how the floppy mutant domain interacts more tightly with the ligand than the well-packed wild-type protein. Moreover, the flexible calixarene ligand interacts with higher affinity to both wild-type and mutated protein domains than a conformationally rigid calixarene analog previously reported. These findings underscore the crucial role of flexibility in molecular recognition processes, for both small ligands and large biomolecular surfaces.

10194435|t|A mutation in the extracellular cysteine-rich repeat region of the beta3 subunit activates integrins alphaIIbbeta3 and alphaVbeta3.
10194435|t|Inside-out signaling regulates the ligand-binding function of integrins through changes in receptor affinity and/or avidity. For example, alphaIIbbeta3 is in a low-affinity/avidity state in resting platelets, and activation of the receptor by platelet agonists enables fibrinogen to bind. In addition, certain mutations and truncations of the integrin cytoplasmic tails are associated with a high-affinity/avidity receptor. To further evaluate the structural basis of integrin activation, stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants were screened for high-affinity/avidity variants of alphaIIbbeta3. One clone (AM-1) expressed constitutively active alphaIIbbeta3, as evidenced by (1) binding of soluble fibrinogen and PAC1, a ligand-mimetic antialphaIIbbeta3 antibody; and (2) fibrinogen-dependent cell aggregation. Sequence analysis and mutant expression in 293 cells proved that a single amino acid substitution in the cysteine-rich, extracellular portion of beta3(T562N) was responsible for receptor activation. In fact, T562N also activated alphaVbeta3, leading to spontaneous binding of soluble fibrinogen to 293 cells. In contrast, neither T562A nor T562Q activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that acquisition of asparagine at residue 562 was the relevant variable. T562N also led to aberrant glycosylation of beta3, but this was not responsible for the receptor activation. The binding of soluble fibrinogen to alphaIIbbeta3(T562N) was not sufficient to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), indicating that additional post-ligand binding events are required to activate this protein tyrosine kinase during integrin signaling. These studies have uncovered a novel gain-of-function mutation in a region of beta3 intermediate between the ligand-binding region and the cytoplasmic tail, and they suggest that this region is involved in integrin structural changes during inside-out signaling.

16284184|t|Gab1, SHP2, and protein kinase A are crucial for the activation of the endothelial NO synthase by fluid shear stress.
16284184|t|Fluid shear stress enhances NO production in endothelial cells by a mechanism involving the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the phosphorylation of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). We investigated the role of the scaffolding protein Gab1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in this signal transduction cascade in cultured and native endothelial cells. Fluid shear stress elicited the phosphorylation and activation of Akt and eNOS as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHP2. Overexpression of a Gab1 mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology domain abrogated the shear stress-induced phosphorylation of Akt but failed to affect the phosphorylation or activity of eNOS. The latter response, however, was sensitive to a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Mutation of Gab1 Tyr627 to phenylalanine (YF-Gab1) to prevent the binding of SHP2 completely prevented the shear stress-induced phosphorylation of eNOS, leaving the Akt response intact. A dominant-negative SHP2 mutant prevented the activation of PKA and phosphorylation of eNOS without affecting that of Akt. Moreover, shear stress elicited the formation of a signalosome complex including eNOS, Gab1, SHP2 and the catalytic subunit of PKA. In isolated murine carotid arteries, flow-induced vasodilatation was prevented by a PKA inhibitor as well as by overexpression of either the YF-Gab1 or the dominant-negative SHP2 mutant. Thus, the shear stress-induced activation of eNOS depends on Gab1 and SHP2, which, in turn, regulate the phosphorylation and activity of eNOS by a PKA-dependent but Akt-independent mechanism.

11119718|t|Analysis of FAK-associated signaling pathways in the regulation of cell cycle progression.
11119718|t|Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important mediator of signal transduction pathways initiated by integrins in cell migration, survival and cell cycle regulation. The ability of FAK to mediate integrin signaling in the regulation of cell cycle progression depends on the phosphorylation of Tyr397, which implies a functional significance for the formation of FAK signaling complexes with Src, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and Grb7. We have previously described a FAK mutant, D395A, that selectively disrupts FAK binding to PI3K, but allows FAK association with Src. Using this mutation in a mislocalized FAK mutant background, we show here that formation of a FAK/PI3K complex is not sufficient for cell cycle progression but the formation of a FAK/Src complex plays an essential role. We also show that mutation of D395 to A disrupted FAK association with Grb7. This suggests that a FAK/Grb7 complex is not involved in the cell cycle regulation either, which is supported by direct analysis of cells expressing a dominant negative Grb7 construct. Finally, we provide evidence that the Src-dependent association of FAK with Grb2 and p130(Cas) are both required for the regulation of cell cycle progression by FAK. Together, these studies identify important FAK downstream signaling pathways in cell cycle regulation.

24585775|t|A talin mutant that impairs talin-integrin binding in platelets decelerates αIIbβ3 activation without pathological bleeding.
24585775|t|Tight regulation of integrin affinity is critical for hemostasis. A final step of integrin activation is talin binding to 2 sites within the integrin β cytoplasmic domain. Binding of talin to a membrane-distal NPxY sequence facilitates a second, weaker interaction of talin with an integrin membrane-proximal region (MPR) that is critical for integrin activation. To test the functional significance of these distinct interactions on platelet function in vivo, we generated knock-in mice expressing talin1 mutants with impaired capacity to interact with the β3 integrin MPR (L325R) or NPLY sequence (W359A). Both talin1(L325R) and talin1(W359A) mice were protected from experimental thrombosis. Talin1(L325R) mice, but not talin(W359A) mice, exhibited a severe bleeding phenotype. Activation of αIIbβ3 was completely blocked in talin1(L325R) platelets, whereas activation was reduced by approximately 50% in talin1(W359A) platelets. Quantitative biochemical measurements detected talin1(W359A) binding to β3 integrin, albeit with a 2.9-fold lower affinity than wild-type talin1. The rate of αIIbβ3 activation was slower in talin1(W359A) platelets, which consequently delayed aggregation under static conditions and reduced thrombus formation under physiological flow conditions. Together our data indicate that reduction of talin-β3 integrin binding affinity results in decelerated αIIbβ3 integrin activation and protection from arterial thrombosis without pathological bleeding.

11386849|t|A novel inborn error in the ligand-binding domain of the vitamin D receptor causes hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets.
11386849|t|Mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) cause hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR), an autosomal recessive disease resulting in target organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. In this report, we describe the clinical case and molecular basis of HVDRR in an Asian boy exhibiting the typical clinical features of the disease including alopecia. Using cultured dermal fibroblasts from the patient, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) resistance was demonstrated by a shift in the dose response required for 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (24-hydroxylase) mRNA induction. Western blot showed that the cells express a normal size VDR but contained reduced levels of receptor compared to normal cells. At 24 degrees C, the affinity of the patient's VDR for [(3)H]1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was 50-fold lower than the VDR in normal fibroblasts. Sequence analysis identified a unique T to G missense mutation in exon 6 that changed phenylalanine to cysteine at amino acid 251 (F251C). The recreated F251C mutant VDR showed reduced transactivation activity using a 24-hydroxylase promoter-luciferase reporter. Maximal transactivation activity exhibited by the WT VDR was not achieved by the mutant VDR even when the cells were treated with up to 10(-6) M 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). However, the transactivation activity was partially rescued by addition of RXRalpha. In the yeast two-hybrid system and GST-pull-down assays, high concentrations of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were needed to promote F251C mutant VDR binding to RXRalpha, indicating defective heterodimerization. In conclusion, a novel mutation was identified in the VDR LBD that reduces VDR abundance and its affinity for 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and interferes with RXRalpha heterodimerization resulting in the syndrome of HVDRR.

9070439|t|Importance of the A-helix of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase for stability and for orienting subdomains at the cleft interface.
9070439|t|All eukaryotic protein kinases share a conserved catalytic core. In the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) this core is preceded by a myristylation motif followed by a long helix with Trp 30 at the end of this A-helix filling a hydrophobic cavity between the two lobes of the core. To understand the importance of the A-helix, the myristylation motif (delta 1-14) as well as the entire N-terminal segment (delta 1 -39) were deleted. In addition, Trp 30 was replaced with both Tyr and Ala. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. rC(delta 1-14), rC(W30Y), and rC(W30A) all had reduced thermostability, but were catalytically indistinguishable from wild-type C. Based on Surface Plasmon Resonance, all three also formed stable holoenzyme complexes with the RI-subunit, although the appKds were reduced by more than 10-fold due to decrease in the association rate. Surprisingly, however, the holoenzymes were even more thermostable than wild-type holoenzyme. To obtain active enzyme, it was necessary to purify rC(delta 1-39) as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-rC(delta 1-39), although its thermostability (Tm) was decreased by 12.5 degrees C, was catalytically similar to wild-type C and was inhibited by both the type I and II R-subunits and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). The Tm for holoenzyme II formed with GST-rC(delta 1-39) was 16.5 degrees C greater than the Tm for free GST-rC(delta 1-39), and the Ka(cAMP) was increased nearly 10-fold. These mutants point out striking and unanticipated differences in how the RI and RII subunits associate with the C-subunit to form a stable holoenzyme and indicate, furthermore, that this N-terminal segment, far from the active site cleft, influences those interactions. The importance of the A-helix and Trp 30 for stability correlates with its location at the cleft interface where it orients the C-helix in the small lobe and the activation loop in the large so that these subdomains are aligned in a way that allows for correct configuration of residues at the active site. This extensive network of contacts that links the A-helix directly to the active site in cAPK is compared to other kinases whose crystal structures have been solved.

25202009|t|A cytosolic relay of heat shock proteins HSP70-1A and HSP90β monitors the folding trajectory of the serotonin transporter.
25202009|t|Mutations in the C terminus of the serotonin transporter (SERT) disrupt folding and export from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we examined the hypothesis that a cytosolic heat shock protein relay was recruited to the C terminus to assist folding of SERT. This conjecture was verified by the following observations. (i) The proximal portion of the SERT C terminus conforms to a canonical binding site for DnaK/heat shock protein of 70 kDa (HSP70). A peptide covering this segment stimulated ATPase activity of purified HSP70-1A. (ii) A GST fusion protein comprising the C terminus of SERT pulled down HSP70-1A. The interaction between HSP70-1A and SERT was visualized in live cells by Förster resonance energy transfer: it was restricted to endoplasmic reticulum-resident transporters and enhanced by an inhibitor that traps HSP70-1A in its closed state. (iv) Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed complex formation of SERT with HSP70-1A and HSP90β. Consistent with an HSP relay, co-chaperones (e.g. HSC70-HSP90-organizing protein) were co-immunoprecipitated with the stalled mutants SERT-R607A/I608A and SERT-P601A/G602A. (v) Depletion of HSP90β by siRNA or its inhibition increased the cell surface expression of wild type SERT and SERT-F604Q. In contrast, SERT-R607A/I608A and SERT-P601A/G602A were only rendered susceptible to inhibition of HSP70 and HSP90 by concomitant pharmacochaperoning with noribogaine. (vi) In JAR cells, inhibition of HSP90 also increased the levels of SERT, indicating that endogenously expressed transporter was also susceptible to control by HSP90β. These findings support the concept that the folding trajectory of SERT is sampled by a cytoplasmic chaperone relay.

23406872|t|A novel interaction between FRMD7 and CASK: evidence for a causal role in idiopathic infantile nystagmus.
23406872|t|Idiopathic infantile nystagmus (IIN) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of eye movement that can be caused by mutations in the FRMD7 gene that encodes a FERM domain protein. FRMD7 is expressed in the brain and knock-down studies suggest it plays a role in neurite extension through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, yet little is known about its precise molecular function and the effects of IIN mutations. Here, we studied four IIN-associated missense mutants and found them to have diverse effects on FRMD7 expression and cytoplasmic localization. The C271Y mutant accumulates in the nucleus, possibly due to disruption of a nuclear export sequence located downstream of the FERM-adjacent domain. While overexpression of wild-type FRMD7 promotes neurite outgrowth, mutants reduce this effect to differing degrees and the nuclear localizing C271Y mutant acts in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit neurite formation. To gain insight into FRMD7 molecular function, we used an IP-MS approach and identified the multi-domain plasma membrane scaffolding protein, CASK, as a FRMD7 interactor. Importantly, CASK promotes FRMD7 co-localization at the plasma membrane, where it enhances CASK-induced neurite length, whereas IIN-associated FRMD7 mutations impair all of these features. Mutations in CASK cause X-linked mental retardation. Patients with C-terminal CASK mutations also present with nystagmus and, strikingly, we show that these mutations specifically disrupt interaction with FRMD7. Together, our data strongly support a model whereby CASK recruits FRMD7 to the plasma membrane to promote neurite outgrowth during development of the oculomotor neural network and that defects in this interaction result in nystagmus.

12660155|t|Functional expression of the epithelial Ca(2+) channels (TRPV5 and TRPV6) requires association of the S100A10-annexin 2 complex.
12660155|t|TRPV5 and TRPV6 constitute the Ca(2+) influx pathway in a variety of epithelial cells. Here, we identified S100A10 as the first auxiliary protein of these epithelial Ca(2+) channels using yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays. This S100 protein forms a heterotetrameric complex with annexin 2 and associates specifically with the conserved sequence VATTV located in the C-terminal tail of TRPV5 and TRPV6. Of these five amino acids, the first threonine plays a crucial role since the corresponding mutants (TRPV5 T599A and TRPV6 T600A) exhibited a diminished capacity to bind S100A10, were redistributed to a subplasma membrane area and did not display channel activity. Using GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that annexin 2 is part of the TRPV5-S100A10 complex. Furthermore, the S100A10-annexin 2 pair colocalizes with the Ca(2+) channels in TRPV5-expressing renal tubules and TRPV6-expressing duodenal cells. Importantly, downregulation of annexin 2 using annexin 2-specific small interfering RNA inhibited TRPV5 and TRPV6-mediated currents in transfected HEK293 cells. In conclusion, the S100A10-annexin 2 complex plays a crucial role in routing of TRPV5 and TRPV6 to plasma membrane.

9819392|t|Phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr)-dependent and -independent mechanisms of p190 RhoGAP-p120 RasGAP interaction: Tyr 1105 of p190, a substrate for c-Src, is the sole p-Tyr mediator of complex formation.
9819392|t|p190 RhoGAP is a 190-kDa protein that stably associates with p120 RasGAP and regulates actin dynamics through members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Previous studies have indicated a direct relationship between levels of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation, the extent and kinetics of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced actin rearrangements, and EGF-induced cell cycle progression, suggesting that p190 links Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling with signaling through the actin cytoskeleton. Determining which tyrosine residues in p190 are phosphorylated, what factors regulate phosphorylation of these sites, and what effect tyrosine phosphorylation has on p190 function is key to understanding the role(s) that p190 may play in these processes. To begin investigating these questions, we used biochemical approaches to characterize the number and relative levels of in vivo-phosphorylated tyrosine residues on endogenous p190 from C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts. Only two tryptic phosphopeptides containing phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr), a major site, identified as Y1105, and a minor, unidentified site, were detected. Phosphorylation of Y1105, but not the minor site, was modulated in vivo to a greater extent by overexpression of c-Src than by the EGF receptor and was efficiently catalyzed by c-Src in vitro, indicating that Y1105 is a selective and preferential target of c-Src both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro and in vivo coprecipitation analysis using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing wild-type and Y1105F variants of the p190 middle domain, variants of full-length p190 ectopically expressed in COS-7 cells, and endogenous p190 and p120 in C3H10T1/2 cells revealed that p190 could bind to p120 in the presence and absence of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation. p-Tyr-independent complexes comprised 10 to 20% of the complexes formed in the presence of p-Tyr. Mutation of Y1105 from Tyr to Phe resulted in complete loss of p-Tyr-dependent complex formation, indicating that p-Y1105 was the sole p-Tyr residue mediating binding to p120. These studies describe a specific mechanism by which c-Src can regulate p190-p120 association and also document a significant role for p-Tyr-independent means of p190-p120 binding.

10497223|t|Identification of a talin-binding site in the integrin beta(3) subunit distinct from the NPLY regulatory motif of post-ligand binding functions. The talin n-terminal head domain interacts with the membrane-proximal region of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.
10497223|t|Following platelet aggregation, integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) becomes associated with the platelet cytoskeleton. The conserved NPLY sequence represents a potential beta-turn motif in the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail and has been suggested to mediate the interaction of beta(3) integrins with talin. In the present study, we performed a double mutation (N744Q/P745A) in the integrin beta(3) subunit to test the functional significance of this beta-turn motif. Chinese hamster ovary cells were co-transfected with cDNA constructs encoding mutant beta(3) and wild type alpha(IIb). Cells expressing either wild type (A5) or mutant (D4) alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhered to fibrinogen; however, as opposed to control A5 cells, adherent D4 cells failed to spread, form focal adhesions, or initiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the role of the NPLY motif in talin binding, we examined the ability of the mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3) to interact with talin in a solid phase binding assay. Both wild type and mutant alpha(IIb)beta(3), purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to a similar extent to immobilized talin. Additionally, purified talin failed to interact with peptides containing the AKWDTANNPLYK sequence indicating that the talin binding domain in the integrin beta(3) subunit does not reside in the NPLY motif. In contrast, specific binding of talin to peptides containing the membrane-proximal HDRKEFAKFEEERARAK sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail was observed, and this interaction was blocked by a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the 47-kDa N-terminal head domain of talin (rTalin-N). In addition, RGD affinity purified platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) bound dose-dependently to immobilized rTalin-N, indicating that an integrin-binding site is present in the talin N-terminal head domain. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the NPLY beta-turn motif regulates post-ligand binding functions of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in a manner independent of talin interaction. Moreover, talin was shown to bind through its N-terminal head domain to the membrane-proximal sequence of the beta(3) cytoplasmic tail.

12673200|t|Delineation of the domains required for physical and functional interaction of p14ARF with human topoisomerase I.
12673200|t|We recently reported an interaction between the p14(ARF) protein and human topoisomerase I (Topo I) resulting in the stimulation of the relaxation activity of Topo I. Our data showed that the complex between the two proteins was located within the nucleolus. In the present work, we have investigated the regions of p14(ARF) involved in this interaction by using targeted point mutagenesis and deletion mutants. A region encompassing exon 2-encoded sequence was required for physical binding of p14(ARF) to Topo I as well as for stimulatory activity of the enzyme. Exon 1 beta-encoded segment was not implicated in the interaction. Moreover, among p14(ARF) point mutants selected for their high conservation among different mammalian species, mutant p14(ARF) (RR87, 88AA) did not stimulate Topo I in spite of its association with the enzyme, suggesting its direct implication in the functional activity of ARF. In contrast, one mutant, p14(ARF) (R71A), was more efficient than wild-type protein to activate Topo I, suggesting that this residue is a key element to modulate Topo I activity. Finally, only ARF-Topo I complexes containing p14(ARF) exon 2 segment were found to be localized in the nucleolus, suggesting that this subnuclear location is linked to the biological function of the ARF-Topo I complex.

10562557|t|SUMO-1 modification activates the transcriptional response of p53.
10562557|t|The p53 tumour suppressor protein is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In normal cells p53 is constitutively ubiquitylated by the Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase. When the p53 response is activated by stress signals p53 levels rise due to inhibition of this degradative pathway. Here we show that p53 is modified by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 at a single site, K386, in the C-terminus of the protein. Modification in vitro requires only SUMO-1, the SUMO-1 activating enzyme and ubc9. SUMO-1 and ubiquitin modification do not compete for the same lysine acceptor sites in p53. Overexpression of SUMO-1 activates the transcriptional activity of wild-type p53, but not K386R p53 where the SUMO-1 acceptor site has been mutated. The SUMO-1 modification pathway therefore acts as a potential regulator of the p53 response and may represent a novel target for the development of therapeutically useful modulators of the p53 response.

9322914|t|Site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant bovine placental lactogen at lysine-73 leads to selective attenuation of its somatogenic activity.
9322914|t|Bovine placental lactogen (bPL) is capable of binding and transducing biological activity via somatogenic and lactogenic receptors. To modify this capability, three analogs, bPL(K73D), bPL(K73F) and bPL(K73A), mutated at position 73, and corresponding to R64 in human GH (hGH), were produced in Escherichia coli. Circular dichroic spectrum analyses indicated proper refolding in all cases. Biological activity of these analogs was tested in vitro. In a lactogenic-receptor-mediated Nb2 rat lymphoma cell bioassay, bPL and its analogs acted similarly. In another lactogenic bioassay that measures beta-casein synthesis by HC-11 mouse mammary-gland cells, the analogs were 30-40% as potent as bPL. In contrast, somatogenic receptor-mediated bioactivity in FDC-P1 cells transfected with either rabbit (rb) or hGH receptor (R) was almost completely abolished in these analogs. In receptor binding assays, the effect was more conspicuous and the mutations affected not only somatogenic but also lactogenic binding. Binding to rat (r) and rabbit PRL receptor extracellular domains (ECDs) or membrane-embedded receptors was only slightly changed, except for bPL (K73D), which displayed very low affinity. In somatogenic binding assays to intact IM-9 human lymphocytes, hGHR-ECD or bovine liver membranes, bPL (K73D) did not bind at all, and bPL(K73F) or bPL(K73A) binding was drastically reduced. Binding experiments performed in real time using a BIAcore apparatus revealed that the decreased binding could be mainly attributed to increased k(off) rather than decreased k(on) values. The complex with hGHR-ECD revealed a 2:1 stoichiometry with bPL, bPL(K73F) and bPL(K73A), although the complex with these analogs was less stable than with bPL, whereas bPL(K73D) scarcely assembled a 1:1 complex. In contrast, bPL and the three analogs formed stable 1:2 complexes with rPRL-ECD. These results suggest that position 73 in bPL is more important for somatogenic than lactogenic properties and concurs with results from other groups, which have shown that R64, the analogous amino acid in hGH holds the same differential importance with respect to somatogenic binding.

9312058|t|Induced N- and C-terminal cleavage of p53: a core fragment of p53, generated by interaction with damaged DNA, promotes cleavage of the N-terminus of full-length p53, whereas ssDNA induces C-terminal cleavage of p53.
9312058|t|p53 is able to recognize and bind sites of DNA damage and, in some way, damage to cellular DNA activates a p53 response leading to G1 arrest or apoptosis. We have previously shown that 'damaged DNA' induces N-terminal cleavage of p53 to generate p40(DeltaN) and p35 (core) protein products. We now show that the p35 product has protease activity and is able to cleave between residues 23 and 24 of full-length p53 to generate a novel product, p50(DeltaN23). This activity was inhibited by bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor. Residues 23 and 24 lie within the mdm-2 binding domain of p53 and the possibility that p50(DeltaN23) may be resistant to feedback regulation by mdm-2 is discussed. Unexpectedly, interaction with ssDNA induced two further cleavage products of p53, generated by C-terminal cleavage and designated p50(DeltaC) and p40(DeltaC). In vivo generation of a C-terminal cleavage product of endogenous p53 similar in size to p50(DeltaC) correlated with up-regulation of p21 expression in ML-1 cells exposed to either adriamycin or cisplatin. The possible significance of the various p53 cleavage products in relation to the cellular response to DNA damage is discussed.

11799106|t|The non-ankyrin C terminus of Ikappa Balpha physically interacts with p53 in vivo and dissociates in response to apoptotic stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and transforming growth factor-beta 1-mediated growth suppression.
11799106|t|Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) suppresses the growth of mink lung Mv1Lu epithelial cells, whereas testicular hyaluronidase abolishes the growth inhibition. Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-beta1 rapidly resulted in down-regulation of cytosolic IkappaBalpha and hyaluronidase prevented this effect, suggesting a possible role of IkappaBalpha in the growth regulation. Ectopic expression of wild-type and dominant negative IkappaBalpha prevented TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Nonetheless, the blocking effect of IkappaBalpha is not related to regulation of NF-kappaB function by its N-terminal ankyrin-repeat region (amino acids 1-243). Removal of the PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain-containing C terminus (amino acids 244-314) abolished the IkappaBalpha function, and the C terminus alone blocked the TGF-beta1 growth-inhibitory effect. Co-immunoprecipitation by anti-p53 antibody using Mv1Lu and other types of cells, as well as rat liver and spleen, revealed that a portion of cytosolic IkappaBalpha physically interacted with p53. In contrast, Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates. The cytosolic p53 x IkappaBalpha complex rapidly dissociated in response to apoptotic stress, etoposide- and UV-mediated DNA damage, hypoxia, and TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Also, a rapid increase in the formation of the nuclear p53 x IkappaBalpha complex was observed during exposure to etoposide and UV. In contrast, TGF-beta1-mediated promotion of fibroblast growth failed to mediate p53 x IkappaBalpha dissociation. Mapping by yeast two-hybrid showed that the non-ankyrin C terminus of IkappaBalpha physically interacted with the proline-rich region and a phosphorylation site, serine 46, in p53. Deletion of serine 46 or alteration of serine 46 to glycine abolished the p53 x IkappaBalpha interaction. Alteration to threonine retained the binding interaction, suggesting that serine 46 phosphorylation is involved in the p53 x IkappaBalpha complex formation. Functionally, enhancement of p53 apoptosis was observed when p53 and IkappaBalpha were transiently co-expressed in cells. Together, the IkappaBalpha x p53 complex plays an important role in responses involving growth regulation, apoptosis, and hypoxic stress.

17994549|t|Mutations that impair interaction properties of TRIM32 associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2H.
17994549|t|TRIM32 belongs to a large family of proteins characterized by a tripartite motif, possibly involved in the ubiquitination process, acting as an E3 ligase. In addition, TRIM32 has six NHL repeats with putative interaction properties. A homozygous mutation at the third NHL repeat (D487N) has been found in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2H (LGMD2H). This mutation was only identified in the inbred Manitoba Hutterite or their descendants. Interestingly, a mutation in the B-box domain of TRIM32 cosegregates with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11 (BBS11). The signs of BBS11 include obesity, pigmentary and retinal malformations, diabetes, polydactyly, and no muscular dystrophy, suggesting an alternative disease mechanism. We aim to ascertain whether D487N is the only pathological LGMD2H allele, limited to Hutterites. We studied the TRIM32 gene in 310 LGMD patients with no mutations at the other known loci. We identified four patients with novel mutated alleles. Two mutations were homozygous and missing in controls. These mutations also clustered at the NHL domain, suggesting that a specific (interaction) property might be abolished in LGMD2H patients. No mutations were found at the B-box region where the BBS11 mutation is found. We tested TRIM32 and its mutants by yeast-two-hybrid assay, developing an interaction test to validate mutations. All LGMD2H mutants, but not the BBS11, lost their ability to self-interact. The interaction of TRIM32 mutants with E2N, a protein involved in the ubiquitination process, was similarly impaired. In conclusion, the mutations here reported may cause muscular dystrophy by affecting the interaction properties of TRIM32.

11847211|t|c-Cbl associates directly with the C-terminal tail of the receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor, c-Fms, and down-modulates this receptor but not the viral oncogene v-Fms.
11847211|t|The receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1, also termed M-CSF), the tyrosine kinase c-Fms, was originally determined to be the oncogene product of the McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus, v-Fms. The structural difference between c-Fms and v-Fms amounts to only five point mutations in the extracellular domain, two mutations in the cytoplasmic domain, and the replacement of 50 amino acids by 14 unrelated amino acids at the C-terminal tail. Here, we have identified c-Cbl as the direct binding partner for c-Fms. c-Cbl binds to phosphotyrosine residue 977 at the C-terminal end of feline c-Fms, which is absent in v-Fms. The replacement of the C-terminal end of v-Fms by the corresponding part of c-Fms (vc-Fms) restored the binding potential. As a result, vc-Fms reduced the transforming potency of v-Fms. The overexpression of Cbl did not influence the v-Fms-transformed phenotype, although c-Cbl forms a complex with v-Fms indirectly. In contrast, the expression of Cbl drastically reduced the vc-Fms-transformed phenotype and the activation of Erk and enhanced Fms ubiquitination via phosphotyrosine residue 977. Furthermore, the replacement of tyrosine 977 into phenylalanine in feline c-Fms and vc-Fms reduced the Cbl-dependent ubiquitination. These data suggest that an indirect association of c-Cbl via multimeric complex induced a different signaling pathway from the pathway induced by c-Cbl direct interaction.

23267009|t|A small molecule directly inhibits the p53 transactivation domain from binding to replication protein A.
23267009|t|Replication protein A (RPA), essential for DNA replication, repair and DNA damage signalling, possesses six ssDNA-binding domains (DBDs), including DBD-F on the N-terminus of the largest subunit, RPA70. This domain functions as a binding site for p53 and other DNA damage and repair proteins that contain amphipathic alpha helical domains. Here, we demonstrate direct binding of both ssDNA and the transactivation domain 2 of p53 (p53TAD2) to DBD-F, as well as DBD-F-directed dsDNA strand separation by RPA, all of which are inhibited by fumaropimaric acid (FPA). FPA binds directly to RPA, resulting in a conformational shift as determined through quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in full length RPA. Structural analogues of FPA provide insight on chemical properties that are required for inhibition. Finally, we confirm the inability of RPA possessing R41E and R43E mutations to bind to p53, destabilize dsDNA and quench tryptophan fluorescence by FPA, suggesting that protein binding, DNA modulation and inhibitor binding all occur within the same site on DBD-F. The disruption of p53-RPA interactions by FPA may disturb the regulatory functions of p53 and RPA, thereby inhibiting cellular pathways that control the cell cycle and maintain the integrity of the human genome.

11431700|t|Tbx5 associates with Nkx2-5 and synergistically promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation.
11431700|t|The cardiac homeobox protein Nkx2-5 is essential in cardiac development, and mutations in Csx (which encodes Nkx2-5) cause various congenital heart diseases. Using the yeast two-hybrid system with Nkx2-5 as the 'bait', we isolated the T-box-containing transcription factor Tbx5; mutations in TBX5 cause heart and limb malformations in Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS). Co-transfection of Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 into COS-7 cells showed that they also associate with each other in mammalian cells. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) 'pull-down' assays indicated that the N-terminal domain and N-terminal part of the T-box of Tbx5 and the homeodomain of Nkx2-5 were necessary for their interaction. Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 directly bound to the promoter of the gene for cardiac-specific natriuretic peptide precursor type A (Nppa) in tandem, and both transcription factors showed synergistic activation. Deletion analysis showed that both the N-terminal domain and T-box of Tbx5 were important for this transactivation. A G80R mutation of Tbx5, which causes substantial cardiac defects with minor skeletal abnormalities in HOS, did not activate Nppa or show synergistic activation, whereas R237Q, which causes upper-limb malformations without cardiac abnormalities, activated the Nppa promoter to a similar extent to that of wildtype Tbx5. P19CL6 cell lines overexpressing wildtype Tbx5 started to beat earlier and expressed cardiac-specific genes more abundantly than did parental P19CL6 cells, whereas cell lines expressing the G80R mutant did not differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that two different types of cardiac transcription factors synergistically induce cardiac development.

10617634|t|Akt protein kinase inhibits Rac1-GTP binding through phosphorylation at serine 71 of Rac1.
10617634|t|A putative Akt kinase phosphorylation site ((64)ydRIRplSYp(73)) was found in Rac1/CDC42 and Rho family proteins (RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, and RhoG). Phosphorylation of Rac1 by Akt kinase was assayed with recombinant Rac1 protein and the fluorescein-labeled Rac1 peptide. It was shown that the Rac1 peptide and the recombinant protein were phosphorylated by the activated recombinant Akt kinase and the lysate of SK-MEL28 cells, a human melanoma cell line. The phosphorylation of Rac1 inhibited its GTP-binding activity without any significant change in GTPase activity. Both the GTP-binding and GTPase activities of Rac1 S71A protein (with the serine residue to be phosphorylated replaced with alanine) were abolished regardless of the treatment of Akt kinase. Akt kinase activity and Rac1 peptide phosphorylation were down-regulated by the treatment of SK-MEL28 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), but JNK/SAPK kinase activity was up-regulated. Thus, the results suggest that Akt kinase of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signal transduction pathway phosphorylates serine 71 of Rac1 as one of its authentic substrates and modulates the Rac1 signal transduction pathway through phosphorylation.

10220325|t|Involvement of conserved, acidic residues in the N-terminal domain of troponin C in calcium-dependent regulation.
10220325|t|We have mutated eight conserved, charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal, regulatory domain of troponin C (TnC) so we could investigate their role in troponin-linked Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction. These residues surround a hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain of TnC which, when Ca2+ binds to regulatory sites in this domain, is exposed and interacts with the inhibitory region of troponin I (TnI). We constructed three double mutants (E53A/E54A, E60A/E61A, and E85A/D86A) and two single mutants (R44A and R81A) of rabbit fast skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) in which the charged residues were replaced with neutral alanines. All five of these mutants retained TnC's ability to bind TnI in a Ca2+-dependent manner, to neutralize TnI's inhibition of actomyosin S1 ATPase activity, and to form a ternary complex with TnI and troponin T (TnT). Ternary complexes formed with TnC(R44A) or TnC(R81A) regulated actomyosin S1 ATPase activity normally, with TnI-based inhibition in the absence of Ca2+ and TnT-based activation in the presence of Ca2+. TnC(E53A/E54A) and TnC(E85A/D86A) interacted weakly with TnT, as judged by native gel electrophoresis. Ternary complexes formed with these mutants inhibited actomyosin S1 ATPase activity in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, and did not undergo Ca2+-dependent structural changes in TnI which can be detected by limited chymotryptic digestion. TnC(E60A/E61A) interacted normally with TnT. Its ternary complex showed Ca2+-dependent structural changes in TnI, inhibited actomyosin S1 ATPase in the absence of Ca2+, but did not activate ATPase in the presence of Ca2+. This is the first demonstration that selective mutation of TnC can abolish the activating effect of troponin while its inhibitory function is retained. Our results suggest the existence of an elaborate network of protein-protein interactions formed by TnI, TnT, and the N-terminal domain of TnC, all of which are important in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle contraction.

15994317|t|The platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta phosphorylates and activates G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2. A mechanism for feedback inhibition.
15994317|t|G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) serine-phosphorylates the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRbeta), and thereby diminishes signaling by the receptor. Because activation of GRK2 may involve phosphorylation of its N-terminal tyrosines by c-Src, we tested whether the PDGFRbeta itself could tyrosine-phosphorylate and activate GRK2. To do so, we used wild type (WT) and Y857F mutant PDGFRbetas in HEK cells, which lack endogenous PDGFRs. The Y857F PDGFRbeta autophosphorylates normally but does not phosphorylate exogenous substrates. Although PDGF-stimulated Y857F and WT PDGFRbetas activated c-Src equivalently, the WT PDGFRbeta tyrosine-phosphorylated GKR2 60-fold more than the Y857F PDGFRbeta in intact cells. With purified GRK2 and either WT or Y857F PDGFRbetas immunoprecipitated from HEK cells, GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation was PDGF-dependent and required the WT PDGFRbeta, even though the WT and Y857F PDGFRbetas autophosphorylated equivalently. This PDGFRbeta-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation enhanced GRK2 activity: GRK2-mediated seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRbeta was 9-fold greater for the WT than for the Y857F in response to PDGF, but equivalent when GRK2 was activated by sequential stimulation of beta2-adrenergic and PDGF-beta receptors. Furthermore, both PDGFRbeta-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and GRK2-mediated PDGFRbeta seryl phosphorylation were reduced approximately 50% in intact cells by mutation to phenylalanine of three tyrosines in the N-terminal domain of GRK2. We conclude that the activated PDGFRbeta itself phosphorylates GRK2 tyrosyl residues and thereby activates GRK2, which then serine-phosphorylates and desensitizes the PDGFRbeta.

8437840|t|Alanine mutagenesis of conserved residues in the platelet-derived growth factor family: identification of residues necessary for dimerization and transformation.
8437840|t|Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor define a family of dimeric proteins characterized by eight conserved cysteine residues involved in disulfide bonds. Thirteen non-cysteine residues conserved among the platelet-derived/vascular endothelial growth factors were individually mutated to alanine in v-sis/PDGF-B. In addition, five other residues flanking F148 were also mutated to alanine. The resulting mutants were assayed for transformation of NIH3T3 cells, and the mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to dimerize. Four residues were found to be crucial for disulfide-linked dimer formation: P152 and G162 were mandatory, while R159 and H205 also contributed to efficient dimerization. Four of the mutant proteins (at residues N147, F148, L149 and K185) dimerized efficiently yet exhibited less than 50% transforming activity compared with wild-type v-sis. Two mutants (at residues D142 and F148) were located in a region important for PDGF receptor interaction and were further studied with regard to secretion and PDGF receptor autophosphorylation. A series of substitutions at residue F148 revealed a strong preference for aromatic amino acids. One mutant from this series (F148G) dimerized but was completely inactive for transformation. This study thus identifies four residues in v-sis/PDGF-B important for dimerization and also identifies additional residues critical for full activation of PDGF receptors. The E5 oncoprotein encoded by bovine papillomavirus type I exhibits two short regions of amino acid similarity when compared with the minimal transforming region of v-sis/PDGF-B. Several of the v-sis mutants discussed in this work affect residues that are also present in the E5 oncoprotein, including F148, L149 and H205.

10727532|t|Selective regulation of Gq signaling by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2: direct interaction of kinase N terminus with activated galphaq.
10727532|t|In this study, we investigated the regulation of different G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulated signaling pathways by GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2). We used thyrotropin receptor, which is coupled to different G proteins, to investigate the regulation of Galphas- and Galphaq-mediated signaling (assessed by cAMP and inositol phosphate production, respectively). In transfected cells, both pathways were desensitized by GRK2. However a kinase-dead GRK2 mutant (GRK2-K220R) only decreased inositol phosphate production, indicating that GRK2 could regulate Galphaq signaling through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Similar results were obtained with serotonin receptor 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C), which is coupled to Galphaq. This effect was mimicked by the N-terminal domain of GRK2 (GRK2-Nter), but not by the C-terminal domain. In cells transfected with Galphaq, direct activation of Galphaq signaling (by AlF(4)(-)) was desensitized by GRK2-Nter, indicating an effect at the Galpha-level. For comparison, in parallel samples we studied a protein regulator of G protein signaling RGS4 and we found a similar regulatory profile. We therefore hypothesized that the GRK2-Nter could directly interact with the Galphaq subunit to regulate its signaling, as demonstrated for several RGS proteins. This hypothesis is further supported by the presence, within the GRK2-Nter, of an RGS homology domain. In direct binding experiments, we found that GRK2-Nter interacts with Galphaq (only when activated) but not with Galphas and Galphao. We conclude that GRK2, besides desensitizing the GPCR by phosphorylation, is able to selectively bind to Galphaq and to regulate its signaling.

8621645|t|Co-purification and direct interaction of Ras with caveolin, an integral membrane protein of caveolae microdomains. Detergent-free purification of caveolae microdomains.
8621645|t|Caveolae are plasma membrane specializations that have been implicated in signal transduction. Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. G protein alpha subunits are concentrated in purified preparations of caveolae membranes, and caveolin interacts directly with multiple G protein alpha subunits, including G(s), G(o), and G(i2). Mutational or pharmacologic activation of G alpha subunits prevents the interaction of caveolin with G proteins, indicating that inactive G alpha subunits preferentially interact with caveolin. Here, we show that caveolin interacts with another well characterized signal transducer, Ras. Using a detergent-free procedure for purification of caveolin-rich membrane domains and a polyhistidine tagged form of caveolin, we find that Ras and other classes of lipid-modified signaling molecules co-fractionate and co-elute with caveolin. The association of Ras with caveolin was further evaluated using two distinct in vitro binding assays. Wild-type H-Ras interacted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-caveolin fusion proteins but not with GST alone. Using a battery of GST fusion proteins encoding distinct regions of caveolin, Ras binding activity was localized to a 41-amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic N-terminal domain of caveolin. In addition, reconstituted caveolin-rich membranes (prepared with purified recombinant caveolin and purified lipids) interacted with a soluble form of wild-type H-Ras but failed to interact with mutationally activated soluble H-Ras (G12V). Thus, a single amino acid change (G12V) that constitutively activates Ras prevents or destabilizes this interaction. These results clearly indicate that (i) caveolin is sufficient to recruit soluble Ras onto lipid membranes and (ii) membrane-bound caveolin preferentially interacts with inactive Ras proteins. In direct support of these in vitro studies, we also show that recombinant overexpression of caveolin in intact cells is sufficient to functionally recruit a nonfarnesylated mutant of Ras (C186S) onto membranes, overcoming the normal requirement for lipid modification of Ras. Taken together, these observations suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein to localize or sequester certain caveolin-interacting proteins, such as wild-type Ras, within caveolin-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane.

27807029|t|Cellular Nuclear Export Factors TAP and Aly Are Required for HDAg-L-mediated Assembly of Hepatitis Delta Virus.
27807029|t|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV genome encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), small HDAg (HDAg-S), which is required for viral replication, and large HDAg (HDAg-L), which is essential for viral assembly. HDAg-L is identical to HDAg-S except that it bears a 19-amino acid extension at the C terminus. Both HDAgs contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but only HDAg-L contains a CRM1-independent nuclear export signal at its C terminus. The nuclear export activity of HDAg-L is important for HDV particle formation. However, the mechanisms of HDAg-L-mediated nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein are not clear. In this study, the host cellular RNA export complex TAP-Aly was found to form a complex with HDAg-L, but not with an export-defective HDAg-L mutant, in which Pro(205) was replaced by Ala. HDAg-L was found to colocalize with TAP and Aly in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of HDAg-L was shown to directly interact with the N terminus of TAP, whereas an HDAg-L mutant lacking the NLS failed to interact with full-length TAP. In addition, small hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of TAP or Aly reduced nuclear export of HDAg-L and assembly of HDV virions. Furthermore, a peptide, TAT-HDAg-L(198-210), containing the 10-amino acid TAT peptide and HDAg-L(198-210), inhibited the interaction between HDAg-L and TAP and blocked HDV virion assembly and secretion. These data demonstrate that formation and release of HDV particles are mediated by TAP and Aly.

21144847|t|KSR1 is a functional protein kinase capable of serine autophosphorylation and direct phosphorylation of MEK1.
21144847|t|The extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates diverse cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1) binds each of the three ERK cascade components to facilitate pathway activation. Even though KSR1 contains a C-terminal kinase domain, evidence supporting the catalytic function of KSR1 remains controversial. In this study, we produced recombinant wild-type or kinase-inactive (D683A/D700A) KSR1 proteins in Escherichia coli to test the hypothesis that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase. Recombinant wild-type KSR1, but not recombinant kinase-inactive KSR1, underwent autophosphorylation on serine residue(s), phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP) as a generic substrate, and phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive MAPK/ERK kinase-1 (MEK1). Furthermore, FLAG immunoprecipitates from KSR1(-/-) colon epithelial cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type KSR1 (+KSR1), but not vector (+vector) or FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive KSR1 (+D683A/D700A), were able to phosphorylate kinase-inactive MEK1. Since TNF activates the ERK pathway in colon epithelial cells, we tested the biological effects of KSR1 in the survival response downstream of TNF. We found that +vector and +D683A/D700A cells underwent apoptosis when treated with TNF, whereas +KSR1 cells were resistant. However, +KSR1 cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell loss in the absence of MEK kinase activity. These data provide clear evidence that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase, MEK1 is an in vitro substrate of KSR1, and the catalytic activities of both proteins are required for eliciting cell survival responses downstream of TNF.

20210365|t|A flexible bipartite coiled coil structure is required for the interaction of Hexim1 with the P-TEFB subunit cyclin T1.
20210365|t|Transcription elongation is regulated by the cellular protein Hexim1, which inhibits phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by interacting with the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Hexim1 binds directly to Cyclin T1 of P-TEFb with its coiled coil domain that is subdivided into a highly polar N-terminal segment containing nonconservative residues in the dimer interface and a C-terminal segment with an evolutionarily conserved sequence composition. Here we show that the noncanonical sequence composition of the first coiled coil segment is required for the interaction with Cyclin T1 while the second segment keeps the Cyclin T-binding domain dimeric upon binding. Both coiled coil segments exhibit distinct melting points as shown by heat denaturation experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Deletion of the central stammer motif (Delta316-318) leads to a single denaturation reaction, suggesting formation of a continuous coiled coil. Mutation of noncanonical coiled coil residues K284 and Y291 to valines in the dimer interface of the first segment only slightly increases its stability. Concomitantly, deletion of the stammer but not the double point mutation led to a reduced affinity for Cyclin T1 as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry. Moreover, Cyclin T1 bound Hexim1 with a 1:2 stoichiometry, whereas truncation of the C-terminal coiled coil led to formation of an equimolar complex. These observations suggest that binding to Cyclin T1 induces an asymmetry or sterical hindrance in the first coiled coil segment of dimeric Hexim1 that disallows formation of a 2:2 complex as further supported by analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking experiments.

10644689|t|Structural implication for receptor oligomerization from functional reconstitution studies of mutant V2 vasopressin receptors.
10644689|t|Previous studies have established that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are composed of independent folding domains. Based on this findings we attempted to rescue the function of clinically relevant missense mutations (R137H, S167L, and R181C) within the N-terminal domain of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2-R), by coexpressing mutated full-length (Y280C) and C-terminally truncated (E242X) receptor constructs in COS-7 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies demonstrated a specific association of E242X with full-length V2-Rs even in the presence of missense mutations. Systematic analysis of the structural requirements for the observed receptor/fragment association showed that N-terminal fragments containing at least transmembrane regions 1-3 interact with the full-length V2-R. Despite this specific interaction, no functional reconstitution was achieved for mutant V2-Rs following coexpression with E242X and Y280C. However, functional activity of R137H and R181C upon coexpression with E242X was regained by mutational disruption of the extracellular disulfide bond, which is highly conserved among GPCRs. Our data with the V2-R are consistent with a structural model in which class I GPCRs form contact oligomers by lateral interaction rather than by a domain-swapping mechanism.

7522165|t|Interleukin-7 induces the association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor.
7522165|t|The recently characterized receptor for interleukin (IL)-7 (IL-7R) includes a unique alpha chain as well as a common gamma chain shared with the receptors for IL-2 and IL-4. Engagement of the IL-7R activates the intracellular enzyme phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase but the mechanism of PtdIns 3-kinase activation and the molecular basis of its interaction with IL-7R are not known. Here we show that IL-7 causes the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (p85), and PtdIns 3-kinase activity, to associate with the IL-7R. This interaction can be ascribed to ligand-induced phosphorylation of a single Tyr residue in the receptor's unique alpha chain. Herbimycin A, a specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppresses not only tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-7R but also its association with p85. A phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic tail of the IL-7R alpha chain, but not its non-phosphorylated analogue or phosphopeptides coincident with the sequences surrounding other alpha chain Tyr residues, efficiently competes out p85 binding. Replacement of Tyr449 with Phe results in a loss of p85 binding. Finally, soluble forms of the src homology 2 domains of p85, which bind directly to phosphotyrosyl peptides, specifically inhibit the association of p85 with the IL-7R. Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase recruitment occurs through a single, phosphotyrosine dependent recognition motif surrounding Tyr449 in the IL-7R alpha chain. This motif corresponds to a canonical sequence for p85 binding, Tyr(P)-X-X-Met. Since the closely related IL-2R and IL-4R also activate PtdIns 3-kinase but are devoid of such canonical motifs, our results suggest that the mechanism by which IL-7R recruits and activates PtdIns 3-kinase differs fundamentally from that used by the other receptors. PtdIns 3-kinase may, therefore, play a unique and important role in the biological response to IL-7.

11062062|t|Thermodynamic mixing of molecular states of the epidermal growth factor receptor modulates macroscopic ligand binding affinity.
11062062|t|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr), when expressed on the cell surface, has long been known to display two distinct affinities for epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding. In addition, the treatment of cells expressing the EGFr with phorbol esters has been shown to cause a loss of the high-affinity binding capacity of the receptor. In the present study, point mutations that alter acidic or phosphorylation sites have been made in an intracellular domain near Tyr-992 (residues 988-992) of the EGFr. Equilibrium (125)I-EGF binding studies demonstrate that the conversion of Tyr-992 into glutamate induces a 4-fold decrease in the EGFr apparent low-affinity dissociation constant, whereas the mutation of two acidic residues, Asp-988 and Glu-991, or the conversion of Tyr-992 into phenylalanine does not alter EGFr affinity. Phorbol ester treatment of EGFr-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells results in a loss of high-affinity binding and an increase in the apparent low-affinity dissociation constant of the receptor, similar to the effect of a truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 190 residues are deleted. These results are examined in the context of a new model for regulation of the affinity of the EGFr for EGF in which a cytosolic particle stabilizes the high-affinity conformation of the EGFr and a rapid equilibrium exists between EGFr high-affinity and low-affinity conformations. This model demonstrates that the macroscopic affinities of the EGFr can differ from the affinities of individual EGFr molecules and provides a theoretical framework whereby the measured affinities of the EGFr are modulated by intracellular interactions.

17468108|t|Mutation of a conserved asparagine in the I-like domain promotes constitutively active integrins alphaLbeta2 and alphaIIbbeta3.
17468108|t|The leukocyte beta2 integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors required for a functional immune system. Many leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) mutations disrupt the expression and function of beta2 integrins. Herein, we further characterized the LAD-1 mutation N329S in the beta2 inserted (I)-like domain. This mutation converted alphaLbeta2 from a resting into a high affinity conformer because alphaLbeta2N329S transfectants adhered avidly to ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 in the absence of additional activating agent. An extended open conformation is adopted by alphaLbeta2N329S because of its reactivity with the beta2 activation reporter monoclonal antibodies MEM148 and KIM127. A corresponding mutation in beta3 generated constitutively active alphaIIbbeta3 that adhered to fibrinogen. This Asn is conserved in all human beta subunits, and it resides before the last helix of the I-like domain, which is known to be important in activation signal propagation. By mutagenesis studies and review of existing integrin structures, we conjectured that this conserved Asn may have a primary role in shaping the I-like domain by stabilizing the conformation of the alpha7 helix and the beta6-alpha7 loop in the I-like domain.

27426733|t|Mutations in MAP3K7 that Alter the Activity of the TAK1 Signaling Complex Cause Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia.
27426733|t|Frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD) is a progressive sclerosing skeletal dysplasia affecting the long bones and skull. The cause of FMD in some individuals is gain-of-function mutations in FLNA, although how these mutations result in a hyperostotic phenotype remains unknown. Approximately one half of individuals with FMD have no identified mutation in FLNA and are phenotypically very similar to individuals with FLNA mutations, except for an increased tendency to form keloid scars. Using whole-exome sequencing and targeted Sanger sequencing in 19 FMD-affected individuals with no identifiable FLNA mutation, we identified mutations in two genes-MAP3K7, encoding transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase (TAK1), and TAB2, encoding TAK1-associated binding protein 2 (TAB2). Four mutations were found in MAP3K7, including one highly recurrent (n = 15) de novo mutation (c.1454C>T [ p.Pro485Leu]) proximal to the coiled-coil domain of TAK1 and three missense mutations affecting the kinase domain (c.208G>C [p.Glu70Gln], c.299T>A [p.Val100Glu], and c.502G>C [p.Gly168Arg]). Notably, the subjects with the latter three mutations had a milder FMD phenotype. An additional de novo mutation was found in TAB2 (c.1705G>A, p.Glu569Lys). The recurrent mutation does not destabilize TAK1, or impair its ability to homodimerize or bind TAB2, but it does increase TAK1 autophosphorylation and alter the activity of more than one signaling pathway regulated by the TAK1 kinase complex. These findings show that dysregulation of the TAK1 complex produces a close phenocopy of FMD caused by FLNA mutations. Furthermore, they suggest that the pathogenesis of some of the filaminopathies caused by FLNA mutations might be mediated by misregulation of signaling coordinated through the TAK1 signaling complex.

15247208|t|Ubiquitin is conjugated by membrane ubiquitin ligase to three sites, including the N terminus, in transmembrane region of mammalian 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: implications for sterol-regulated enzyme degradation.
15247208|t|The stability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is negatively regulated by sterols. HMGR is anchored in the ER via its N-terminal region, which spans the membrane eight times and contains a sterol-sensing domain. We have previously established that degradation of mammalian HMGR is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Ravid, T., Doolman, R., Avner, R., Harats, D., and Roitelman, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35840-35847). Here we expressed in HEK-293 cells an HA-tagged-truncated version of HMGR that encompasses all eight transmembrane spans (350 N-terminal residues). Similar to endogenous HMGR, degradation of this HMG(350)-3HA protein was accelerated by sterols, validating it as a model to study HMGR turnover. The degradation of HMG(240)-3HA, which lacks the last two transmembrane spans yet retains an intact sterol-sensing domain, was no longer accelerated by sterols. Using HMG(350)-3HA, we demonstrate that transmembrane region of HMGR is ubiquitinated in a sterol-regulated fashion. Through site-directed Lys --> Arg mutagenesis, we pinpoint Lys(248) and Lys(89) as the internal lysines for ubiquitin attachment, with Lys(248) serving as the major acceptor site for polyubiquitination. Moreover, the data indicate that the N terminus is also ubiquitinated. The degradation rates of the Lys --> Arg mutants correlates with their level of ubiquitination. Notably, lysine-less HMG(350)-3HA is degraded faster than wild-type protein, suggesting that lysines other than Lys(89) and Lys(248) attenuate ubiquitination at the latter residues. The ATP-dependent ubiquitination of HMGR in isolated microsomes requires E1 as the sole cytosolic protein, indicating that ER-bound E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze this modification. Polyubiquitination of HMGR is correlated with its extraction from the ER membrane, a process likely to be assisted by cytosolic p97/VCP/Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, as only ubiquitinated HMGR pulls down p97.

15592520|t|Constitutive activation of the shh-ptc1 pathway by a patched1 mutation identified in BCC.
15592520|t|Mutations in the transmembrane receptor patched1 (ptc1) are responsible for the majority of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases. Many of these mutations, including ptc1-Q688X, result in premature truncation of the ptc1 protein. ptc1-Q688X has been identified in patients with both BCC and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, an inheritable disorder causing a predisposition to cancer susceptibility. Here we describe a mechanism by which ptc1-Q688X causes constitutive cellular signaling. Cells expressing ptc1-Q688X demonstrate an increase in cell cycle progression and induce cell transformation. The ptc1-Q688X mutant enhances Gli1 activity, a downstream reporter of sonic hedgehog (shh)-ptc1 signaling, independent of shh stimulation. In contrast to wild-type ptc1, ptc1-Q688X fails to associate with endogenous cyclin B1. Expression of nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivatives promotes Gli1-dependent transcription, which correlates temporally with cyclin B1-cdk1 kinase activity. Coexpression of wild-type ptc1 with a nuclear-targeted cyclin B1 derivative, mutated to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, dramatically decreases Gli1 activity. In addition, the coexpression of this constitutively nuclear cyclin B1 derivative with ptc1-Q688X substantially enhances foci formation. These studies therefore describe a molecular mechanism for the aberrant activity of ptc1-Q688X that includes the premature activation of the transcription factor Gli1.

12042306|t|Ntg2p, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA N-glycosylase/apurinic or apyrimidinic lyase involved in base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, interacts with the DNA mismatch repair protein Mlh1p. Identification of a Mlh1p binding motif.
12042306|t|Ntg2p is a DNA N-glycosylase/apurinic or apyrimidinic lyase involved in base excision repair of oxidatively damaged DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and a GST in vitro transcription and translation assay, the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Mlh1p was demonstrated to interact physically with Ntg2p. The Mlh1p binding site maps to amino acids residues 15-40 of Ntg2p. The Ntg2p binding site is localized in the C-terminal end (483-769) of Mlh1p. Overproduction of Ntg2p results in a mutator phenotype with enhanced frameshift reversion frequency, suggesting partial inhibition of the MMR pathway. In contrast, inactivation of NTG2 does not enhance mutagenesis, indicating that Ntg2p is not required for MMR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mlh1p binding domain of Ntg2p revealed three amino acids (Ser(24), Tyr(26), Phe(27)) that are absolutely required for Ntg2p-Mlh1p interaction. These residues are part of a motif found in Ntg2p (Arg(23)-Ser(24)-Lys(25)-Tyr(26)-Phe(27)), Exo1p (Arg(444)-Ser(445)-Lys(446)-Phe(447)-Phe(448)), and Sgs1p (Lys(1383)-Ser(1384)-Lys(1385)-Phe(1386)-Phe(1387)). In these three proteins, the motif is part of the domain that interacts with the C-terminal end of Mlh1p. Furthermore, S445A, F447A, and F448A mutants of Exo1p do not bind Mlh1p, but the wild type Exo1p does. Therefore, we propose that the R/K-S-R/K-Y/F-Y/F sequence could define a Mhl1 binding motif. The results also suggest that base excision repair and MMR can cooperate to prevent deleterious effects of oxidative DNA damage.

18497968|t|Specific proteolysis of the A-kinase-anchoring protein 149 at the Asp582 residue by caspases during apoptosis.
18497968|t|A-kinase-anchoring protein 149 (AKAP149) is a member of a structurally diverse, though functionally similar anchoring protein family and is localized to the outer membrane of mitochondria and in the endoplasmic reticulum-nuclear envelope network. AKAP149 plays an important role in controlling the subcellular localization and temporal specificity of protein phosphorylation and mRNA metabolism by tethering kinases and phosphatases, such as protein kinase A and type I protein phosphatase, through its N-terminal protein-binding motifs and mRNAs via its C-terminal RNA-binding motifs. It is well recognized that caspases play a central role in transducing and amplifying the intracellular death signal and that apoptosis is executed as a consequence of caspase-mediated cleavage of multiple cellular substrates. The identification of novel death substrates and elucidation of the consequences of their proteolytic cleavages by caspases are therefore crucial for our understanding of cell death and other biological processes. Herein, we demonstrated that AKAP149 is a direct substrate of active caspase-3, -8 -and -10 in vitro and in vivo. 35S-labeled full-length AKAP149 was completely cleaved in vitro by active caspase-3, -8 and -10 into two fragments of approximately 105 and 45 kDa, while caspase-2 cleaved it partially and caspase-1 did not cleave it at all. AKAP149 was also cleaved by caspases during Fas- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T and HeLa cells, which were blocked by specific inhibitors of caspase-3 and -8. The specific cleavage site for these caspases was mapped in vitro and in vivo to Asp582 at AKAP149, which is located between the protein kinase A regulatory subunit anchoring and KH RNA-binding domains. In addition, HeLa cells transiently overexpressing AKAP149 D582E mutant were resistant to staurosporine-induced HeLa cell apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that AKAP149 activity may be deregulated by caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptotic cell death and may provide useful information for elucidating the apoptosis signaling pathways in detail.

14715079|t|Molecular and functional consequences of Smad4 C-terminal missense mutations in colorectal tumour cells.
14715079|t|Smad4 is an essential signal transducer of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling pathway and has been identified as a tumour suppressor, being mutated in approx. 50% of pancreatic cancers and approx. 15% of colorectal cancers. Two missense mutations in the C-terminal domain of Smad4, D351H (Asp351-->His) and D537Y (Asp537-->Tyr), have been described recently in the human colorectal cancer cell lines CACO-2 and SW948 respectively [Woodford-Richens, Rowan, Gorman, Halford, Bicknell, Wasan, Roylance, Bodmer and Tomlinson (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 9719-9723]. Previous work in vitro suggested that only Asp-351 was required for interaction with Smad2 [Wu, Fairman, Penry and Shi (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20688-20694]. In the present study, we investigate the functional consequences of these point mutations in vivo. We demonstrate that neither of these colorectal cancer cells undergo growth arrest in response to TGF-beta, which can be explained, at least in part, by their inability to up-regulate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 (CIP1 ) or p15 ( INK4b) after TGF-beta stimulation. Although the point-mutated Smad4s are expressed at normal levels in these colorectal cancer cells, they cannot interact with either TGF-beta-induced phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3. As a result, these Smad4 mutants do not accumulate in the nucleus after TGF-beta stimulation, are not recruited to DNA by relevant Smad-binding transcription factors and cannot generate transcriptionally active DNA-bound complexes. Therefore both these colorectal tumour cells completely lack functional Smad4 activity owing to the missense mutations. Given the location of these mutations in the three-dimensional structure of the Smad4 C-terminal domain, the results also give us significant insights into Smad complex formation.

16004603|t|The penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2 interacts directly with the ESCRT-I component TSG101, and Ca2+-dependently co-localizes to aberrant endosomes with dominant-negative AAA ATPase SKD1/Vps4B.
16004603|t|ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) is a Ca2+-binding protein that belongs to the PEF (penta-EF-hand) protein family. Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X)/AIP1 (ALG-2-interacting protein 1), one of its binding partners, interacts with TSG101 and CHMP4 (charged multivesicular body protein 4), which are components of ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for transport I) and ESCRT-III respectively. In the present study, we investigated the association between ALG-2 and ESCRT-I. By a GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assay using HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney 293T) cell lysates, endogenous TSG101 and two other exogenously expressed ESCRT-I components [hVps28 (human vacuolar protein sorting 28) and hVps37A] were shown to associate with GST-ALG-2 in the presence of Ca2+. By the yeast two-hybrid assay, however, a positive interaction was observed with only TSG101 among the three ESCRT-I components, suggesting that ALG-2 associates with hVps28 and hVps37A indirectly through TSG101. Using various deletion mutants of TSG101, the central PRR (proline-rich region) was found to be sufficient for interaction with ALG-2 by the GST-pull-down assay. Direct binding of ALG-2 to the TSG101 PRR was demonstrated by an overlay assay using biotin-labelled ALG-2 as a probe. In immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of HeLa cells that overexpressed a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-fused ATPase-defective dominant-negative form of SKD1/Vps4B (GFP-SKD1(E235Q)), ALG-2 exhibited a punctate distribution at the perinuclear area and co-localized with GFP-SKD1(E235Q) to aberrant endosomes. This punctate distribution of ALG-2 was markedly diminished by treatment of HeLa cells with a membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator. Moreover, a Ca2+-binding-defective mutant of ALG-2 did not co-localize with GFP-SKD1(E235Q). Our findings suggest that ALG-2 may function as a Ca2+-dependent accessory protein of the endosomal sorting machinery by interacting directly with TSG101 as well as with Alix.

17716621|t|Structural analysis of obscurin gene in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
17716621|t|Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiac disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction. Molecular genetic studies have revealed that HCM is caused by mutations in genes for sarcomere/Z-band components including titin/connectin and its associate proteins. However, disease-causing mutations can be found in about half of the patients, suggesting that other disease-causing genes remain to be identified. To explore a novel disease gene, we searched for obscurin gene (OBSCN) mutations in HCM patients, because obscurin interacts with titin/connectin. Two linked variants, Arg4344Gln and Ala4484Thr, were identified in a patient and functional analyses demonstrated that Arg4344Gln affected binding of obscurin to Z9-Z10 domains of titin/connectin, whereas Ala4484Thr did not. Myc-tagged obscurin showed that Arg4344Gln impaired obscurin localization to Z-band. These observations suggest that the obscurin abnormality may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCM.

24231739|t|NAC1, A POZ/BTB protein interacts with Parkin and may contribute to Parkinson's disease.
24231739|t|Loss-of-function in the Parkin protein is thought to play a part in causing neuronal cell death in patients with Parkinson's disease. This study explores the effect of Parkin degradation, via the overexpression of nucleus accumbens 1 (NAC1), on cell viability. It was found that NAC1 and Parkin are co-localized within the cell and interact with one another, leading to a decrease in Parkin levels. Moreover, NAC1 down-regulates Parkin by presenting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, which causes a decrease in proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. Consequently, this decrease in proteasomal activity leads to an increase in the cells' susceptibility to proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. It was also found that Parkin and NAC1 are key proteins found to be present mainly in the cytoplasm and are co-localized in neurons of Parkinson's disease patients. Interestingly, mutation in the POZ/BTB domain (Q23L) of NAC1 disrupts the co-localization and interaction of NAC1 with Parkin and it further abrogates the proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. We further observed that co-transfection of the mutant form of NAC1 with Parkin reversed the proteasome activity and 20S proteasome protein levels. These results indicate a novel interaction between NAC1 and Parkin that leads to neuronal cell death, a main characteristic in Parkinson's disease.

9890944|t|A critical site in the core of the CCR5 chemokine receptor required for binding and infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
9890944|t|Like the CCR5 chemokine receptors of humans and rhesus macaques, the very homologous (approximately 98-99% identical) CCR5 of African green monkeys (AGMs) avidly binds beta-chemokines and functions as a coreceptor for simian immunodeficiency viruses. However, AGM CCR5 is a weak coreceptor for tested macrophage-tropic (R5) isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Correspondingly, gp120 envelope glycoproteins derived from R5 isolates of HIV-1 bind poorly to AGM CCR5. We focused on a unique extracellular amino acid substitution at the juncture of transmembrane helix 4 (TM4) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Arg for Gly at amino acid 163 (G163R)) as the likely source of the weak R5 gp120 binding and HIV-1 coreceptor properties of AGM CCR5. Accordingly, a G163R mutant of human CCR5 was severely attenuated in its ability to bind R5 gp120s and to mediate infection by R5 HIV-1 isolates. Conversely, the R163G mutant of AGM CCR5 was substantially strengthened as a coreceptor for HIV-1 and had improved R5 gp120 binding affinity relative to the wild-type AGM CCR5. These substitutions at amino acid position 163 had no effect on chemokine binding or signal transduction, suggesting the absence of structural alterations. The 2D7 monoclonal antibody has been reported to bind to ECL2 and to block HIV-1 binding and infection. Whereas 2D7 antibody binding to CCR5 was unaffected by the G163R mutation, it was prevented by a conservative ECL2 substitution (K171R), shared between rhesus and AGM CCR5s. Thus, it appears that the 2D7 antibody binds to an epitope that includes Lys-171 and may block HIV-1 infection mediated by CCR5 by occluding an HIV-1-binding site in the vicinity of Gly-163. In summary, our results identify a site for gp120 interaction that is critical for R5 isolates of HIV-1 in the central core of human CCR5, and we propose that this site collaborates with a previously identified region in the CCR5 amino terminus to enable gp120 binding and HIV-1 infections.

20525692|t|PKA regulates vacuolar H+-ATPase localization and activity via direct phosphorylation of the a subunit in kidney cells.
20525692|t|The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a major contributor to luminal acidification in epithelia of Wolffian duct origin. In both kidney-intercalated cells and epididymal clear cells, cAMP induces V-ATPase apical membrane accumulation, which is linked to proton secretion. We have shown previously that the A subunit in the cytoplasmic V(1) sector of the V-ATPase is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). Here we have identified by mass spectrometry and mutagenesis that Ser-175 is the major PKA phosphorylation site in the A subunit. Overexpression in HEK-293T cells of either a wild-type (WT) or phosphomimic Ser-175 to Asp (S175D) A subunit mutant caused increased acidification of HCO(3)(-)-containing culture medium compared with cells expressing vector alone or a PKA phosphorylation-deficient Ser-175 to Ala (S175A) mutant. Moreover, localization of the S175A A subunit mutant expressed in HEK-293T cells was more diffusely cytosolic than that of WT or S175D A subunit. Acute V-ATPase-mediated, bafilomycin-sensitive H(+) secretion was up-regulated by a specific PKA activator in HEK-293T cells expressing WT A subunit in HCO(3)(-)-free buffer. In cells expressing the S175D mutant, V-ATPase activity at the membrane was constitutively up-regulated and unresponsive to PKA activators, whereas cells expressing the S175A mutant had decreased V-ATPase activity that was unresponsive to PKA activation. Finally, Ser-175 was necessary for PKA-stimulated apical accumulation of the V-ATPase in a polarized rabbit cell line of collecting duct A-type intercalated cell characteristics (Clone C). In summary, these results indicate a novel mechanism for the regulation of V-ATPase localization and activity in kidney cells via direct PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the A subunit at Ser-175.

25450693|t|The RLIP76 N-terminus binds ARNO to regulate PI 3-kinase, Arf6 and Rac signaling, cell spreading and migration.
25450693|t|RLIP76 is a multifunctional protein involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis, and a promising therapeutic target in many cancers. RLIP76 harbors docking sites for many proteins, and we have found that it interacts with ARNO, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf6, and that RLIP76 regulates activation of Rac1 via Arf6, and regulates cell spreading and migration in an ARNO and Arf6-dependent manner. Here we show that ARNO interacts with the RLIP76 N-terminal domain, and this domain was required for RLIP76-dependent cell spreading and migration. We identified two sites in the RLIP76 N-terminus with differential effects on ARNO binding and downstream signaling: Ser29/Ser30 and Ser62. Ser29/30 mutation to Alanine inhibited ARNO interaction and was sufficient to block RLIP76-dependent cell spreading and migration, as well as RLIP76-dependent Arf6 activation. In contrast, RLIP76(S62A) interacted with ARNO and supported Arf6 activation. However, both sets of mutations blocked Rac1 activation. RLIP76-mediated Rac and Arf6 activation required PI3K activity. S29/30A mutations inhibited RLIP76-dependent PI3K activation, but S62A mutation did not. Together these results show that ARNO interaction with the RLIP76 N-terminus regulates cell spreading and motility via PI3K and Arf6, independent of RLIP76 control of Rac.

15381704|t|Protein kinase C isoforms differentially phosphorylate human choline acetyltransferase regulating its catalytic activity.
15381704|t|Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) synthesizes acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons; regulation of its activity or response to physiological stimuli is poorly understood. We show that ChAT is differentially phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms on four serines (Ser-440, Ser-346, Ser-347, and Ser-476) and one threonine (Thr-255). This phosphorylation is hierarchical, with phosphorylation at Ser-476 required for phosphorylation at other serines. Phosphorylation at some, but not all, sites regulates basal catalysis and activation. Ser-476 with Ser-440 and Ser-346/347 maintains basal ChAT activity. Ser-440 is targeted by Arg-442 for phosphorylation by PKC. Arg-442 is mutated spontaneously (R442H) in congenital myasthenic syndrome, rendering ChAT inactive and causing neuromuscular failure. This mutation eliminates phosphorylation of Ser-440, and Arg-442, not phosphorylation of Ser-440, appears primarily responsible for ChAT activity, with Ser-440 phosphorylation modulating catalysis. Finally, basal ChAT phosphorylation in neurons is mediated predominantly by PKC at Ser-476, with PKC activation increasing phosphorylation at Ser-440 and enhancing ChAT activity.

14633983|t|The phosphorylation state of an autoregulatory domain controls PACS-1-directed protein traffic.
14633983|t|PACS-1 is a cytosolic sorting protein that directs the localization of membrane proteins in the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/endosomal system. PACS-1 connects the clathrin adaptor AP-1 to acidic cluster sorting motifs contained in the cytoplasmic domain of cargo proteins such as furin, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and in viral proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef. Here we show that an acidic cluster on PACS-1, which is highly similar to acidic cluster sorting motifs on cargo molecules, acts as an autoregulatory domain that controls PACS-1-directed sorting. Biochemical studies show that Ser278 adjacent to the acidic cluster is phosphorylated by CK2 and dephosphorylated by PP2A. Phosphorylation of Ser278 by CK2 or a Ser278-->Asp mutation increased the interaction between PACS-1 and cargo, whereas a Ser278-->Ala substitution decreased this interaction. Moreover, the Ser278-->Ala mutation yields a dominant-negative PACS-1 molecule that selectively blocks retrieval of PACS-1-regulated cargo molecules to the TGN. These results suggest that coordinated signaling events regulate transport within the TGN/endosomal system through the phosphorylation state of both cargo and the sorting machinery.

10833518|t|Interaction between nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I and the H4L subunit of the viral RNA polymerase is required for vaccinia virus early gene transcript release.
10833518|t|Signal-dependent termination is restricted to early poxvirus genes whose transcription is catalyzed by the virion form of RNA polymerase. Two termination factors have been identified. Vaccinia termination factor/capping enzyme is a multifunctional heterodimer that also catalyzes the first three steps of mRNA cap formation and is an essential intermediate gene transcription initiation factor. Nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I) is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. COOH-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I retain both ATPase and DNA binding activities but are unable either to terminate transcription or to act as dominant negative mutants in vitro. One appealing model posits that the COOH-terminal region of NPH I binds to one or more components in the termination complex. In an attempt to identify NPH I-related protein/protein interactions involved in transcription termination, a series of pull-down experiments were done. Among several vaccinia virus proteins tested, the H4L subunit, unique to the virion form of RNA polymerase, was shown to bind glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NPH I. To further confirm this interaction in virus-infected cells, we constructed recombinant vaccinia virus, vNPHINGST, that expresses GST-tagged NPH I. The H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase specifically co-purified with GST-NPH I, consistent with a physical interaction. Through the analysis of a series of NH(2)- and COOH-terminal truncation mutations of H4L, the NPH I interaction site was localized to the NH(2)-terminal 195 amino acids of the H4L protein. The H4L binding site on NPH I was mapped to the COOH-terminal region between 457 and 631. Furthermore, COOH-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I failed to bind the NH(2)-terminal region of H4L, explaining their inability to support transcription termination. The COOH-terminal end of NPH I was also shown to be required for transcript release activity and for dominant negative inhibition of release. The requirement for an essential interaction between NPH I and H4L provides an explanation for the observed restriction of transcription termination to early viral genes.

11854310|t|Drosophila Kelch regulates actin organization via Src64-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation.
11854310|t|The Drosophila kelch gene encodes a member of a protein superfamily defined by the presence of kelch repeats. In Drosophila, Kelch is required to maintain actin organization in ovarian ring canals. We set out to study the actin cross-linking activity of Kelch and how Kelch function is regulated. Biochemical studies using purified, recombinant Kelch protein showed that full-length Kelch bundles actin filaments, and kelch repeat 5 contains the actin binding site. Two-dimensional electrophoresis demonstrated that Kelch is tyrosine phosphorylated in a src64-dependent pathway. Site-directed mutagenesis determined that tyrosine residue 627 is phosphorylated. A Kelch mutant with tyrosine 627 changed to alanine (KelY627A) rescued the actin disorganization phenotype of kelch mutant ring canals, but failed to produce wild-type ring canals. Electron microscopy demonstrated that phosphorylation of Kelch is critical for the proper morphogenesis of actin during ring canal growth, and presence of the nonphosphorylatable KelY627A protein phenocopied src64 ring canals. KelY627A protein in ring canals also dramatically reduced the rate of actin monomer exchange. The phenotypes caused by src64 mutants and KelY627A expression suggest that a major function of Src64 signaling in the ring canal is the negative regulation of actin cross-linking by Kelch.

16288208|t|AP2alpha alters the transcriptional activity and stability of p53.
16288208|t|AP2alpha and p53 form nuclear complexes that establish a functional partnership, which regulates the expression of certain genes involved in cell growth and metastasis. The growth effects of AP2alpha are mediated through p21WAF1/CIP1 and the ability for AP2alpha to coactivate p21 requires p53. Herein, we have localized the AP2-binding region of p53 to amino acids 305-375. Analysis of 26 distinct p53 alleles established a correlation between AP2alpha binding and transcriptional coactivation. The L350P point mutation was the only nonbinding allele that retained normal transcriptional activity by reporter assay. Although both wild-type and L350P alleles facilitated binding of AP2alpha to the p21 promoter, the L350P allele was significantly reduced in its ability to induce the endogenous p21 gene, demonstrating a striking difference in activity comparing reporter assays with activation of endogenous p53 target genes. Interestingly, expression of AP2 in the absence of radiation repressed p53-mediated induction of p21 and this effect was explained by a reduction in p53 stability induced by AP2alpha overexpression. We conclude that AP2alpha has competing effects on p53 activity through coactivation and decreased stability. These findings may provide a mechanism to account for the discrepancies reported for the association between AP2 and p21 expression in tumor tissue.

26078055|t|Rem uncouples excitation-contraction coupling in adult skeletal muscle fibers.
26078055|t|In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction (EC) coupling requires depolarization-induced conformational rearrangements in L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.1) to be communicated to the type 1 ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) release channel (RYR1) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via transient protein-protein interactions. Although the molecular mechanism that underlies conformational coupling between Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1 has been investigated intensely for more than 25 years, the question of whether such signaling occurs via a direct interaction between the principal, voltage-sensing α(1S) subunit of Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1 or through an intermediary protein persists. A substantial body of evidence supports the idea that the auxiliary β(1a) subunit of Ca(V)1.1 is a conduit for this intermolecular communication. However, a direct role for β(1a) has been difficult to test because β(1a) serves two other functions that are prerequisite for conformational coupling between Ca(V)1.1 and RYR1. Specifically, β(1a) promotes efficient membrane expression of Ca(V)1.1 and facilitates the tetradic ultrastructural arrangement of Ca(V)1.1 channels within plasma membrane-SR junctions. In this paper, we demonstrate that overexpression of the RGK protein Rem, an established β subunit-interacting protein, in adult mouse flexor digitorum brevis fibers markedly reduces voltage-induced myoplasmic Ca(2+) transients without greatly affecting Ca(V)1.1 targeting, intramembrane gating charge movement, or releasable SR Ca(2+) store content. In contrast, a β(1a)-binding-deficient Rem triple mutant (R200A/L227A/H229A) has little effect on myoplasmic Ca(2+) release in response to membrane depolarization. Thus, Rem effectively uncouples the voltage sensors of Ca(V)1.1 from RYR1-mediated SR Ca(2+) release via its ability to interact with β(1a). Our findings reveal Rem-expressing adult muscle as an experimental system that may prove useful in the definition of the precise role of the β(1a) subunit in skeletal-type EC coupling.

16848763|t|Phosphorylation of the ARE-binding protein DAZAP1 by ERK2 induces its dissociation from DAZ.
16848763|t|A protein in RAW 264.7 macrophages, which became phosphorylated in response to LPS (lipopolysaccharide), was identified as the RNA-binding protein called DAZAP1 [DAZ (deleted in azoospermia)-associated protein 1]. The phosphorylation of this protein was prevented by specific inhibition of MKK1 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase 1], indicating that it was phosphorylated via the classical MAPK cascade. Further experiments showed that DAZAP1 was phosphorylated stoichiometrically in vitro by ERK2 (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 2) at two Thr-Pro sequences (Thr269 and Thr315), and that both sites became phosphorylated in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells in response to PMA or EGF (epidermal growth factor), or RAW 264.7 macrophages in response to LPS. Phosphorylation induced by each stimulus was prevented by two structurally distinct inhibitors of MKK1 (PD184352 and U0126), demonstrating that DAZAP1 is a physiological substrate for ERK1/ERK2. The mutation of Thr269 and Thr315 to aspartate or the phosphorylation of these residues caused DAZAP1 to dissociate from its binding partner DAZ. DAZ interacts with PABP [poly(A)-binding protein] and thereby stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing short poly(A) tails [Collier, Gorgoni, Loveridge, Cooke and Gray (2005) EMBO J. 24, 2656-2666]. In the present study we have shown that DAZ cannot bind simultaneously to DAZAP1 and PABP, and suggest that the phosphorylation-induced dissociation of DAZ and DAZAP1 may allow the former to stimulate translation by interacting with PABP.

12359306|t|Interactions between the juxtamembrane domain of the EGFR and calmodulin measured by surface plasmon resonance.
12359306|t|One early response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation is an increase in intracellular calcium. We have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to study real-time interactions between the intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR and calmodulin. The EGFR-JM (Met(644)-Phe(688)) was expressed as a GST fusion protein and immobilised on a sensor chip surface. Calmodulin specifically interacts with EGFR-JM in a calcium-dependent manner with a high on and high off rate. Chemical modification of EGFR-JM by using arginine-selective phenylglyoxal or deletion of the basic segment Arg(645)-Arg(657) inhibits the interaction. Phosphorylation of EGFR-JM by protein kinase C (PKC) or glutamate substitution of Thr(654) inhibits the interaction, suggesting that PKC phosphorylation electrostatically interferes with calmodulin binding to basic arginine residues. Calmodulin binding was also inhibited by suramin. Our results suggest that EGFR-JM is essential for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated calcium-calmodulin signalling and for signal integration between other signalling pathways.

9872991|t|Domain-specific interactions between the p185(neu) and epidermal growth factor receptor kinases determine differential signaling outcomes.
9872991|t|We expressed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) along with mutant p185(neu) proteins containing the rat transmembrane point mutation. The work concerned the study of the contributions made by various p185(neu) subdomains to signaling induced by a heterodimeric ErbB complex. Co-expression of full-length EGFR and oncogenic p185(neu) receptors resulted in an increased EGF-induced phosphotyrosine content of p185(neu), increased cell proliferation to limiting concentrations of EGF, and increases in both EGF-induced MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activation. Intracellular domain-deleted p185(neu) receptors (T691stop neu) were able to associate with full-length EGFR, but induced antagonistic effects on EGF-dependent EGF receptor down-regulation, cell proliferation, and activation of MAPK and PI 3-kinase pathways. Ectodomain-deleted p185(neu) proteins (TDelta5) were unable to physically associate with EGFR, and extracellular domain-deleted p185(neu) forms failed to augment activation of MAPK and PI 3-kinase in response to EGF. Association of EGFR with a carboxyl-terminally truncated p185(neu) mutant (TAPstop) form did not increase transforming efficiency and phosphotyrosine content of the TAPstop species, and proliferation of EGFR.TAPstop-co-expressing cells in response to EGF was similar to cells containing EGFR only. Thus, neither cooperative nor inhibitory effects were observed in cell lines co-expressing either TDelta5 or TAPstop mutant proteins. Unlike the formation of potent homodimer assemblies composed of oncogenic p185(neu), the induction of signaling from p185(neu).EGFR heteroreceptor assemblies requires the ectodomain for ligand-dependent physical association and intracellular domain contacts for efficient intermolecular kinase activation.

Rac and Cdc42 containing a Y40C effector site substitution no longer intact with the Ser/Thr kinase p65PAK and are unable to activate the JNK MAP kinase pathway. However, they still induce cytoskeletal changes and G1 cell cycle progression. Rac containing an F37A effector site substitution, on the other hand, no longer interacts with the Ser/Thr kinase p160ROCK and is unable to induce lamellipodia or G1 progression. We conclude that Rac and Cdc42 control MAP kinase pathways and actin cytoskeleton organization independently through distinct downstream targets.

27254819|t|DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11 (DCAF11) mediates degradation of Stem-loop binding protein at the end of S phase.
27254819|t|In eukaryotes, bulk histone expression occurs in the S phase of the cell cycle. This highly conserved system is crucial for genomic stability and proper gene expression. In metazoans, Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which binds to 3' ends of canonical histone mRNAs, is a key factor in histone biosynthesis. SLBP is mainly expressed in S phase and this is a major mechanism to limit bulk histone production to the S phase. At the end of S phase, SLBP is rapidly degraded by proteasome, depending on two phosphorylations on Thr 60 and Thr 61. Previously, we showed that SLBP fragment (aa 51-108) fused to GST, is sufficient to mimic the late S phase (S/G2) degradation of SLBP. Here, using this fusion protein as bait, we performed pull-down experiments and found that DCAF11, which is a substrate receptor of CRL4 complexes, binds to the phosphorylated SLBP fragment. We further confirmed the interaction of full-length SLBP with DCAF11 and Cul4A by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We also showed that DCAF11 cannot bind to the Thr61/Ala mutant SLBP, which is not degraded at the end of S phase. Using ectopic expression and siRNA experiments, we demonstrated that SLBP expression is inversely correlated with DCAF11 levels, consistent with the model that DCAF11 mediates SLBP degradation. Finally, we found that ectopic expression of the S/G2 stable mutant SLBP (Thr61/Ala) is significantly more toxic to the cells, in comparison to wild type SLBP. Overall, we concluded that CRL4-DCAF11 mediates the degradation of SLBP at the end of S phase and this degradation is essential for the viability of cells.

11751919|t|Requirement of helix 1 and the AF-2 domain of the thyroid hormone receptor for coactivation by PGC-1.
11751919|t|Although PGC-1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1) has been previously shown to enhance thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/retinoid X receptor-mediated ucp-1 gene expression in a ligand-induced manner in rat fibroblast cells, the precise mechanism of PGC-1 modulation of TR function has yet to be determined. In this study, we show that PGC-1 can potentiate TR-mediated transactivation of reporter genes driven by natural thyroid hormone response elements both in a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner and that the extent of coactivation is a function of the thyroid hormone response element examined. Our data also show that PGC-1 stimulation of TR activity in terms of Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion is strictly ligand-dependent. In addition, an E457A AF-2 mutation had no effect on the ligand-induced PGC-1 enhancement of TR activity, indicating that the conserved charged residue in AF-2 is not essential for this PGC-1 function. Furthermore, GST pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the PGC-1 LXXLL motif is required for ligand-induced PGC-1/TR interaction. This agonist-dependent PGC-1/TR interaction also requires both helix 1 and the AF-2 region of the TR ligand-binding domain. Taken together, these results support the notion that PGC-1 is a bona fide TR coactivator and that PGC-1 modulates TR activity via a mechanism different from that utilized with peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma.

15219201|t|A novel Phe171Cys mutation in integrin alpha causes Glanzmann thrombasthenia by abrogating alphabeta complex formation.
15219201|t|BACKGROUND: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by lack of platelet aggregation induced by most agonists. The disease is caused by mutations in either alpha(IIb)[glycoprotein (GP) IIb] or beta(3) (GPIIIa) genes that lead to a lack or dysfunction of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) which serves as a fibrinogen receptor. PATIENTS: Mucocutaneous bleeding manifestations and platelet dysfunction consistent with GT were observed in three members of a Cypriot family: a 3-year-old proband, her father and her paternal uncle. OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular basis of GT in this family and to characterize possible biochemical and structural defects. RESULTS: Analysis of the patients' platelets by fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated trace amounts of beta(3), no alpha(IIb) and no alpha(IIb)beta(3) on the membrane. Sequence analysis revealed a novel T607G transversion in exon 5 of the alpha(IIb) gene predicting a Phe171Cys alteration that created a PstI recognition site. All three patients were homozygous for the mutation, the mother and paternal grandparents of the proband were heterozygous, whereas 110 healthy subjects lacked this transversion. Chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with cDNAs of mutated alpha(IIb) and wild-type beta(3) failed to express alpha(IIb)beta(3) as shown by immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry experiments. Structural analysis of the alpha(IIb)beta(3) model, which was based on the crystal structure of alpha(v)beta(3), indicated that Phe171 plays an essential role in the interface between the beta-propeller domain of alpha(IIb) and the betaA domain of beta(3). CONCLUSIONS: A novel Phe171Cys mutation in the alpha(IIb) gene of patients with GT is associated with abrogation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) complex formation.

8637717|t|Characterization of p21Cip1/Waf1 peptide domains required for cyclin E/Cdk2 and PCNA interaction.
8637717|t|The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 is responsible for the p53-dependent growth arrest of cells in G1 phase following DNA damage. In the present study we investigated regions of p21 involved in inhibition of the G1/S phase cyclin-dependent kinase, cyclin E/Cdk2, as well as regions of p21 important for binding to this kinase and recombinant PCNA. To perform these studies we synthesized a series of overlapping peptides spanning the entire p21 sequence and used them in in vitro assays with cyclin E/Cdk2-immune complexes and with recombinant p21 and PCNA proteins. One amino-terminal p21 peptide spanning amino acids 15-40, antagonized p21 binding and inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase. Antagonism of p21 binding was, however, lost in a similar peptide lacking amino acids 15-20, or in a peptide in which cysteine-18 was substituted for a serine. These results suggest that this peptide region is important for p21 interaction with cyclin E/Cdk2. A second peptide (amino acids 58-77) also antagonized p21-activity, but this peptide did not affect the ability of p21 to interact with cyclin E/Cdk2. A region of p21 larger than 26 amino acids is presumably required for Cdk-inhibition because none of the peptides we tested inhibited cyclin E/Cdk2. We also found that a peptide spanning amino acids 21-45 bound recombinant p21 in ELISA assays, and additional studies revealed a requirement for amino acids 26 through 45 for this interaction. A p21 peptide spanning amino acids 139-164 was found to bind PCNA in a filter binding assay and this peptide suppressed recombinant p21-PCNA interaction. Conformational analysis revealed that peptides spanning amino acids 21-45 and 139-164 tended towards an alpha-helical conformation in trifluoroethanol buffer, indicating that these regions are probably in a coiled conformation in the native protein. Taken together, our results provide an insight into domains of p21 that are involved in cyclin E/Cdk2 and PCNA interaction. Our results also suggest that a potential p21 dimerization domain may lie in the amino-terminus of p21. Continued exploration of these domains could prove useful in assessing p21-mimetic strategies for cancer treatment.

24086544|t|Low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1)-dependent cell signaling promotes neurotrophic activity in embryonic sensory neurons.
24086544|t|Developing sensory neurons require neurotrophic support for survival, neurite outgrowth and myelination. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) transactivates Trk receptors and thereby functions as a putative neurotrophin. Herein, we show that LRP1 is abundantly expressed in developing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and that LRP1-dependent cell signaling supports survival, neurite extension and receptivity to Schwann cells even in the absence of neurotrophins. Cultured embryonic DRG neurons (E15) were treated with previously characterized LRP1 ligands, LRP1-receptor binding domain of α2-macroglobulin (RBD), hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (PEX) or controls (GST) for two weeks. These structurally diverse LRP1 ligands significantly activated and sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) 5-fold (p<0.05), increased expression of growth-associated protein-43(GAP43) 15-fold (P<0.01), and increased neurite outgrowth 20-fold (P<0.01). Primary sensory neurons treated with LRP1 ligands survived > 2 weeks in vitro, to an extent equaling NGF, a finding associated with canonical signaling mechanisms and blockade of caspase-3 cleavage. LRP1 ligand-induced survival and sprouting were blocked by co-incubation with the LRP1 antagonist, receptor associated protein (RAP), whereas RAP had no effect on NGF-induced activity. Site directed mutagenesis of the LRP1 ligand, RBD, in which Lys(1370) and Lys(1374) are converted to alanine to preclude LRP1 binding, were ineffective in promoting cell signaling, survival or inducing neurite extension in primary sensory neurons, confirming LRP1 specificity. Furthermore, LRP1-induced neurite sprouting was mediated by Src-family kinase (SFK) activation, suggesting transactivation of Trk receptors. Co-cultures of primary embryonic neurons and Schwann cells showed that LRP1 agonists promoted axonal receptivity to myelination to Schwann cells. Collectively, these findings identify LRP1 as a novel and perhaps essential trophic molecule for sensory neuronal survival and development.

10856301|t|Glycogen synthase association with the striated muscle glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase-1. Synthase activation involves scaffolding regulated by beta-adrenergic signaling.
10856301|t|Glycogen-binding subunits for protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) target the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) to glycogen particles, where the enzymes glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase are concentrated. Here we identify sites within the striated muscle glycogen-binding subunit (G(M)) that mediate direct binding to glycogen synthase. Both PP1C and glycogen synthase were coimmunoprecipitated with a full-length FLAG-tagged G(M) transiently expressed in COS7 cells or C2C12 myotubes. Deletion and mutational analysis of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the N-terminal domain of G(M) (residues 1-240) identified two putative sites for binding to glycogen synthase, one of which is the WXNXGXNYX(I/L) motif that is conserved among the family of PP1 glycogen-binding subunits. Either deletion of this motif or Ala substitution of Asn-228 in this motif disrupted the binding of glycogen synthase. Expression of full-length FLAG-G(M) in cells increased the activity of endogenous glycogen synthase, but protein disabled in either PP1 binding or glycogen synthase binding did not produce synthase activation. The results show that efficient activation of glycogen synthase requires a scaffold function of G(M) that involves simultaneous binding of both PP1C and glycogen synthase. Isoproterenol and forskolin treatment of cells decreased glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-G(M), thereby limiting synthase activation by PP1. This response was insensitive to inhibition by H-89, therefore probably not involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but did require inclusion of microcystin-LR during cell lysis, implying that phosphorylation was modulating binding of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation control of binding to a scaffold site on the G(M) subunit of PP1 offers a new mechanism for regulation of muscle glycogen synthase in response to beta-adrenergic signals.

8550609|t|Functional importance of the amino terminus of Gq alpha.
8550609|t|Gq alpha is palmitoylated at residues Cys9 and Cys10. Removal of palmitate from purified Gq alpha with palmitoylthioesterase in vitro failed to alter interactions of Gq alpha with phospholipase C-beta 1, the G protein beta gamma subunit complex, or m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Mutants C9A, C10A, C9A/C10A, C9S/C10S, and truncated Gq alpha (removal of residues 1-6) were synthesized in Sf9 cells and purified. Loss of both Cys residues or truncation prevented palmitoylation of Gq alpha. However, truncated Gq alpha and the single Cys mutants activated phospholipase C-beta 1 normally, while the double Cys mutants were poor activators. Loss of both Cys residues impaired but did not abolish interaction of Gq alpha with m1 receptors. These Cys residues are thus important regardless of their state of palmitoylation. When expressed in HEK-293 or Sf9 cells, all of the proteins studied associated entirely or predominantly with membranes, although a minor fraction of nonpalmitoylated Gq alpha proteins accumulated in the cytosol of HEK-293 cells. When subjected to TX-114 phase partitioning, a significant fraction of all of the proteins, including those with no palmitate, was found in the detergent-rich phase. Removal of residues 1-34 of Gq alpha caused a loss of surface hydrophobicity as evidenced by complete partitioning into the aqueous phase. The Cys residues at the amino terminus of Gq alpha are thus important for its interactions with effector and receptor, and the amino terminus conveys a hydrophobic character to the protein distinct from that contributed by palmitate.

7961819|t|Prolonged association of temperature-sensitive mutants of human P-glycoprotein with calnexin during biogenesis.
7961819|t|Mutation of amino acids located within or immediately NH2-terminal to transmembrane segment 7 of human P-glycoprotein abolished the ability of the protein to confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Each of these mutant P-glycoproteins had an apparent mass of 150 kDa, compared with 170 kDa for wild-type P-glycoprotein, and the apparent mass was altered by endoglycosidase H digestion. These observations suggest that these mutant proteins were processed improperly, so that they were located in the endoplasmic reticulum and were not targeted correctly to the plasma membrane. Processing of the 150-kDa P-glycoprotein to the 170-kDa mature form of the enzyme for all of the mutants, except Glu707-->Ala and Tyr710-->Ala, was dramatically increased when the cells were grown at 26 degrees C. At the lower growth temperature, the mature protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, and drug efflux activity was restored. We also analyzed the mutants for possible molecular interactions that may contribute to their intracellular retention. We found that core-glycosylated forms of the wild-type and mutant P-glycoproteins were associated with the molecular chaperone calnexin. Only wild-type enzyme, however, was able to escape association with calnexin and be targeted to the plasma membrane. Prolonged association of the mutants with calnexin may be due to misfolding of the protein as evidenced by their relative short half-life of about 3 h, compared with 50 h for the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that calnexin contributes to a quality control mechanism to retain misfolded forms of P-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum.

8943292|t|B cell antigen receptor signaling induces the formation of complexes containing the Crk adapter proteins.
8943292|t|Crk proteins are Src homology (SH) 2/SH3-containing adapter proteins that can mediate the formation of signaling complexes. We show that engaging the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) on the RAMOS B cell line caused both Crk-L and Crk II to associate with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We identified two of these phosphoproteins as Cas and Cbl and showed that both bound to the Crk SH2 domain after BCR engagement. BCR ligation also increased the amount of Crk proteins in the particulate fraction of the cells and induced the formation of Crk.Cas and Crk.Cbl complexes in the particulate fraction. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated Cas and Cbl creates binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain and recruits Crk complexes to cellular membranes. Thus, Crk proteins may participate in BCR signaling by using their SH2 domains to direct the interactions and subcellular localization of proteins that bind to their SH3 domains. In RAMOS cells, we found that the SH3 domains of Crk-L and Crk II bound C3G. Since C3G activates Rap, a negative regulator of the Ras pathway, Crk proteins may participate in regulation of Ras signaling by the BCR.

20647423|t|Signaling kinase AMPK activates stress-promoted transcription via histone H2B phosphorylation.
20647423|t|The mammalian adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine-threonine kinase protein complex that is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which AMPK mediates cellular responses to metabolic stress remain unclear. We found that AMPK activates transcription through direct association with chromatin and phosphorylation of histone H2B at serine 36. AMPK recruitment and H2B Ser36 phosphorylation colocalized within genes activated by AMPK-dependent pathways, both in promoters and in transcribed regions. Ectopic expression of H2B in which Ser36 was substituted by alanine reduced transcription and RNA polymerase II association to AMPK-dependent genes, and lowered cell survival in response to stress. Our results place AMPK-dependent H2B Ser36 phosphorylation in a direct transcriptional and chromatin regulatory pathway leading to cellular adaptation to stress.

7539005|t|Identification of amino acids in the CD11a I-domain important for binding of the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
7539005|t|Leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is a cell surface adhesion receptor for intercellular adhesion molecule-1, -2, and -3 (ICAM-1, -2, -3). Using human/murine chimeras of the I-domain of the LFA-1 alpha subunit (CD11a), we recently identified the epitopes recognized by eight monoclonal antibodies against CD11a that inhibit LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1. In this report, we determined that replacement of the entire human I-domain with the entire murine I-domain in CD11a completely abrogated LFA-1 binding to human ICAM-1 without affecting the gross conformation or heterodimer formation of LFA-1, as assayed by antibody binding. In order to assess which residues of the I-domain are responsible for binding to ICAM-1, we tested the ability of a panel of human/murine I-domain chimeras to bind to human ICAM-1. When complexed with CD18, all CD11a chimeras bound ICAM-1 at levels comparable to wild-type CD11a/CD18, indicating that the residues in these chimeras which differ in human and murine I-domains may not play a critical role in LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1. A series of point mutations of residues that are conserved between murine and human CD11a I-domains, as well as between CD11b and CD11c, were also generated. Substitution of alanine for proline at position 192 in the human CD11a I-domain abrogated adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1. Antibody binding data suggested that this was due to conformational changes within the I-domain. Mutation of the aspartic acids at positions 137 and 239 to either alanine or lysine completely destroyed ICAM-1 binding. The conformation of LFA-1 alanine mutants was not significantly altered. This suggests that these aspartic acids are required for binding of human LFA-1 to human ICAM-1.

27703006|t|Bipartite Role of Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) Keeps CRAF Kinase Poised for Activation.
27703006|t|CRAF kinase maintains cell viability, growth, and proliferation by participating in the MAPK pathway. Unlike BRAF, CRAF requires continuous chaperoning by Hsp90 to retain MAPK signaling. However, the reason behind the continuous association of Hsp90 with CRAF is still elusive. In this study, we have identified the bipartite role of Hsp90 in chaperoning CRAF kinase. Hsp90 facilitates Ser-621 phosphorylation of CRAF and prevents the kinase from degradation. Co-chaperone Cdc37 assists in this phosphorylation event. However, after folding, the stability of the kinase becomes insensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, although the physical association between Hsp90 and CRAF remains intact. We observed that overexpression of Hsp90 stimulates MAPK signaling by activating CRAF. The interaction between Hsp90 and CRAF is substantially increased under an elevated level of cellular Hsp90 and in the presence of either active Ras (Ras(V12)) or EGF. Surprisingly, enhanced binding of Hsp90 to CRAF occurs prior to the Ras-CRAF association and facilitates actin recruitment to CRAF for efficient Ras-CRAF interaction, which is independent of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. However, monomeric CRAF (CRAF(R401H)) shows abrogated interaction with both Hsp90 and actin, thereby affecting Hsp90-dependent CRAF activation. This finding suggests that stringent assemblage of Hsp90 keeps CRAF kinase equipped for participating in the MAPK pathway. Thus, the role of Hsp90 in CRAF maturation and activation acts as a limiting factor to maintain the function of a strong client like CRAF kinase.

18791937|t|AlphaIIbG236E causes Glanzmann thrombasthenia by impairing association with beta3.
18791937|t|Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a recessively inherited bleeding disorder caused by the quantitative or qualitative deficiency of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, integrin alphaIIbbeta3. The N-terminal domain of the alphaIIb subunit is folded in a beta-propeller that plays the role of binding fibrinogen and associating with the ligand-binding region of beta3. Analysing the mutations of Italian GT patients we found that a patient had a alphaIIb G236E missense substitution that substitutes a glycine from the highly conserved PhiPhiGPhi motif of blade 4 of the beta-propeller. To verify experimentally the effect of the substitution of glycine 236 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with normal or mutated alphaIIb in conjunction with normal beta3. Using flow cytometry analysis we found the percentage of HEK cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 that reacted with anti alphaIIbbeta3 was very low. In HEK cells transfected with either alphaIIbbeta3 or alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 and lysed, when immunoblotting was done in non-reducing conditions a band reacting with an antibody against alphaIIb was present in both lysates, although less intense in cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3. In reducing condition alphaIIb from cells transfected with alphaIIbbeta3 was nearly all mature, while in cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 the ratio pro-alphaIIb: alphaIIb was 1 : 1, with signs of degradation of the mutated protein. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against alphaIIb and immunoblotted with an antibody reacting with beta3. While in immunoblots from cells transfected with alphaIIbbeta3 a band corresponding to beta3 was strongly detectable, in immunoblots originating from cells transfected with alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 no band at the same level of normal beta3 was detected. Immunofluorescence studies showed accumulation of alphaIIbG236Ebeta3 in the endoplasmic reticulum and minimal transport to the Golgi. In conclusion we demonstrated that the alphaIIbG236E mutation causes GT by impairing the association with beta3 during biogenesis of the receptor.

9234717|t|Phosphotyrosine binding domain-dependent upregulation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha signaling cascade by transforming mutants of Cbl: implications for Cbl's function and oncogenicity.
9234717|t|Recent studies have demonstrated that Cbl, the 120-kDa protein product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene, serves as a substrate of a number of receptor-coupled tyrosine kinases and forms complexes with SH3 and SH2 domain-containing proteins, pointing to its role in signal transduction. Based on genetic evidence that the Caenorhabditis elegans Cbl homolog, SLI-1, functions as a negative regulator of the LET-23 receptor tyrosine kinase and our demonstration that Cbl's evolutionarily conserved N-terminal transforming region (Cbl-N; residues 1 to 357) harbors a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to activated ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, we examined the possibility that oncogenic Cbl mutants may activate mitogenic signaling by deregulating cellular tyrosine kinase machinery. Here, we show that expression of Cbl-N and two other transforming Cbl mutants (CblY368 delta and Cbl366-382 delta or Cb170Z), but not wild-type Cbl, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to enhancement of endogenous tyrosine kinase signaling. We identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha) as one target of mutant Cbl-induced deregulation. In mutant Cbl transfectants, PDGFR alpha was hyperphosphorylated and constitutively complexed with a number of SH2 domain-containing proteins. PDGFR alpha hyperphosphorylation and enhanced proliferation of mutant Cbl-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were drastically reduced upon serum starvation, and PDGF-AA substituted for the maintenance of these traits. PDGF-AA stimulation of serum-starved Cbl transfectants induced the in vivo association of transfected Cbl proteins with PDGFR alpha. In vitro, Cbl-N directly bound to PDGFR alpha derived from PDGF-AA-stimulated cells but not to that from unstimulated cells, and this binding was abrogated by a point mutation (G306E) corresponding to a loss-of-function mutation in SLI-1. The Cbl-N/G306E mutant protein, which failed to induce enhanced growth and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, also failed to induce hyperphosphorylation of PDGFR alpha. Altogether, these findings identify a novel mechanism of Cbl's physiological function and oncogenesis, involving its PTB domain-dependent direct interaction with cellular tyrosine kinases.

9528769|t|pp90rsk1 regulates estrogen receptor-mediated transcription through phosphorylation of Ser-167.
9528769|t|The estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a member of the steroid receptor superfamily, contains an N-terminal hormone-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1) and a C-terminal hormone-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2). Here, we used in-gel kinase assays to determine that pp90rsk1 activated by either epidermal growth factor (EGF) or phorbol myristate acetate specifically phosphorylates Ser-167 within AF-1. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that pp90rsk1 phosphorylates the N terminus of the wild-type ER but not of a mutant ER in which Ser-167 was replaced by Ala. In vivo, EGF stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-167 as well as Ser-118. Ectopic expression of active pp90rsk1 increased the level of phosphorylation of Ser-167 compared to that of either a mutant pp90rsk1, which is catalytically inactive in the N-terminal kinase domain, or to that of vector control. The ER formed a stable complex with the mutant pp90rsk1 in vivo. Transfection of the mutant pp90rsk1 depressed ER-dependent transcription of both a wild-type ER and a mutant ER that had a defective AF-2 domain (ER TAF-1). Furthermore, replacing either Ser-118 or Ser-167 with Ala in ER TAF-1 showed similar decreases in transcription levels. A double mutant in which both Ser-118 and Ser-167 were replaced with Ala demonstrated a further decrease in transcription compared to either of the single mutations. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that pp90rsk1 phosphorylates Ser-167 of the human ER in vivo and that Ser-167 aids in regulating the transcriptional activity of AF-1 in the ER.

25241353|t|Carboxy terminus of GATA4 transcription factor is required for its cardiogenic activity and interaction with CDK4.
25241353|t|GATA4-6 transcription factors regulate numerous aspects of development and homeostasis in multiple tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origin. In the heart, the best studied of these factors, GATA4, has multiple distinct roles in cardiac specification, differentiation, morphogenesis, hypertrophy and survival. To improve understanding of how GATA4 achieves its numerous roles in the heart, here we have focused on the carboxy-terminal domain and the residues required for interaction with cofactors FOG2 and Tbx5. We present evidence that the carboxy terminal region composed of amino acids 362-400 is essential for mediating cardiogenesis in Xenopus pluripotent explants and embryos. In contrast, the same region is not required for endoderm-inducing activity of GATA4. Further evidence is presented that the carboxy terminal cardiogenic region of GATA4 does not operate as a generic transcriptional activator. Potential mechanism of action of the carboxy terminal end of GATA4 is provided by the results showing physical and functional interaction with CDK4, including the enhancement of cardiogenic activity of GATA4 by CDK4. These results establish CDK4 as a GATA4 partner in cardiogenesis. The interactions of GATA4 with its other well described cofactors Tbx5 and FOG2 are known to be involved in heart morphogenesis, but their requirement for cardiac differentiation is unknown. We report that the mutations that disrupt interactions of GATA4 with Tbx5 and FOG2, G295S and V217G, respectively, do not impair cardiogenic activity of GATA4. These findings add support to the view that distinct roles of GATA4 in the heart are mediated by different determinants of the protein. Finally, we show that the rat GATA4 likely induces cardiogenesis cell autonomously or directly as it does not require activity of endodermal transcription factor Sox17, a GATA4 target gene that induces cardiogenesis non-cell autonomously.

12682077|t|Agonist-induced phosphorylation of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor regulates its interaction with multiple PDZ protein 1.
12682077|t|Multiple PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1), a putative scaffolding protein containing 13 PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1 (PDZ) domains, was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen as a serotonin2C receptor (5-HT2C R)-interacting protein (Ullmer, C., Schmuck, K., Figge, A., and Lubbert, H. (1998) FEBS Lett. 424, 63-68). MUPP1 PDZ domain 10 (PDZ 10) associates with Ser458-Ser-Val at the carboxyl-terminal tail of the 5-HT2C R. Both Ser458 and Ser459 are phosphorylated upon serotonin stimulation of the receptor (Backstrom, J. R., Price, R. D., Reasoner, D. T., and Sanders-Bush, E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23620-23626). To investigate whether phosphorylation of these serines in the receptor regulates MUPP1 interaction, we used several approaches. First, we substituted the serines in the receptor carboxyl tail with aspartates to mimic phosphorylation (S458D, S459D, or S458D/S459D). Pull-down assays demonstrated that Asp mutations at Ser458 significantly decreased receptor tail interaction with PDZ 10. Next, serotonin treatment of 5-HT2C R/3T3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of receptor interaction with PDZ 10. Effects of serotonin on receptor-PDZ 10 binding could be blocked by pretreatment with a receptor antagonist. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reverses the effect of serotonin, indicating that agonist-induced phosphorylation at Ser458 resulted in a loss of MUPP1 association and also revealed a significant amount of basal phosphorylation of the receptor. We conclude that 5-HT2C R interaction with MUPP1 is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at Ser458.

28011284|t|Phosphorylation of Tudor-SN, a novel substrate of JNK, is involved in the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into stress granules.
28011284|t|Posttranslational modifications of certain stress granule (SG) proteins are closely related to the assembly of SGs, a type of cytoplasmic foci structure. Our previous studies revealed that the Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) protein participates in the formation of SGs. However, the functional significance of potential Tudor-SN modifications during stress has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that the Tudor-SN protein was phosphorylated at threonine 103 (T103) upon stimulation with arsenite. In addition, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was found to be responsible for Tudor-SN phosphorylation at the T103 site. We further illustrated that either a T103A mutation or the suppression of phosphorylation of T103 by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs. In addition, the T103A mutation could affect the physical binding of Tudor-SN with the G3BP (Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein) protein but not with the HuR (Hu antigen R) protein and AGTR1-3'UTR (3'-untranslated region of angiotensin II receptor, type 1) mRNA cargo. These data suggested that JNK-enhanced Tudor-SN phosphorylation promotes the interaction between Tudor-SN and G3BP and facilitates the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs under conditions of sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress. This finding provides novel insights into the physiological function of Tudor-SN modification.

16000312|t|Crystal structure of the Yersinia enterocolitica type III secretion chaperone SycT.
16000312|t|Several Gram-negative pathogens deploy type III secretion systems (TTSSs) as molecular syringes to inject effector proteins into host cells. Prior to secretion, some of these effectors are accompanied by specific type III secretion chaperones. The Yersinia enterocolitica TTSS chaperone SycT escorts the effector YopT, a cysteine protease that inactivates the small GTPase RhoA of targeted host cells. We solved the crystal structure of SycT at 2.5 angstroms resolution. Despite limited sequence similarity among TTSS chaperones, the SycT structure revealed a global fold similar to that exhibited by other structurally solved TTSS chaperones. The dimerization domain of SycT, however, differed from that of all other known TTSS chaperone structures. Thus, the dimerization domain of TTSS chaperones does not likely serve as a general recognition pattern for downstream processing of effector/chaperone complexes. Yersinia Yop effectors are bound to their specific Syc chaperones close to the Yop N termini, distinct from their catalytic domains. Here, we showed that the catalytically inactive YopT(C139S) is reduced in its ability to bind SycT, suggesting an ancillary interaction between YopT and SycT. This interaction could maintain the protease inactive prior to secretion or could influence the secretion competence and folding of YopT.

15069075|t|Protein kinase C-zeta-induced phosphorylation of Ser318 in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) attenuates the interaction with the insulin receptor and the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.
15069075|t|Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was recently identified as a novel upstream substrate for the insulin-activated protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta. This interaction down-regulates insulin signal transduction under hyper-insulinemic conditions. To clarify the molecular mechanism of this feedback loop, we sought to identify the PKC-zeta phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 and to investigate their biological significance. Upon incubation of recombinant IRS-1 fragments with PKC-zeta, we identified Ser(318) of rat IRS-1 (Ser(323) in human IRS-1) as the major in vitro phosphorylation site (confirmed by mutation of Ser(318) to alanine). To monitor phosphorylation of Ser(318) in cellular extracts, we prepared a polyclonal phosphosite-specific antibody. The biological significance was studied in baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing the insulin receptor (BHK(IR)). Using the phospho-Ser(318)-specific antibody we observed that insulin stimulates phosphorylation of Ser(318) in IRS-1, which is mediated, at least partially, by PKC-zeta. Moreover, we found that the previously described insulin-stimulated, PKC-zeta-mediated inhibition of the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor and the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was abrogated by mutation of IRS-1 Ser(318) to alanine. These results, generated in BHK(IR) cells, suggest that phosphorylation of Ser(318) by PKC-zeta might contribute to the inhibitory effect of prolonged hyperinsulinemia on IRS-1 function.

11950062|t|Impaired interactions between mouse Eyal harboring mutations found in patients with branchio-oto-renal syndrome and Six, Dach, and G proteins.
11950062|t|Mutations in the EYA1 gene are responsible for branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome as well as for other ocular defects. Most of the mutations are located within or in the vicinity of the EYA domain, which is highly conserved in the EYA protein family. The EYA domain is required for protein-protein interactions, which are important to the biological function of EYA proteins. To determine how EYA1 mutations cause BOR syndrome and/or ocular defects, we tested the effects of Eya1 mutations on interactions with Six. Dach, and G proteins by mammalian two-hybrid and GST-pulldown assays. Defective interactions were noted between BOR-type mutations S486P and L504R of Eya1 and Dach1, G proteins, and some Six proteins. These mutations impaired the activation of transcription from a Six-responsive gene, myogenin, with Six5. S486P and L504R showed an altered digestion pattern with trypsin, and L504R also decreased the sensitivity to V8 protease digestion and produced a peptide fragment with a different M(r). Our results suggest that defective protein-protein interactions of the mutations in the EYA domain underlie BOR syndrome and that SIX, DACH, and/or G proteins are possibly involved in the pathogenic processes.

7642641|t|SHC and GRB-2 are constitutively by an epidermal growth factor receptor with a point mutation in the transmembrane domain.
7642641|t|A single point mutation, Glu627--> Val, equivalent to the activating mutation in the Neu oncogene, was inserted in the transmembrane domain of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Unlike the wild type, Glu627-EGF receptor, transfected in NIH3T3 cells, gave rise to focal transformation and growth in agar even in the absence EGF. Constitutive activity of mutant EGF receptor amounted to 20% of that of wild type receptor stimulated by EGF. In addition, the mutant receptor was more sensitive to EGF, reaching maximum transforming activity at 5 ng/ml EGF. NIH3T3 cells expressing Glu627-EGF receptor showed a transformed phenotype and were not arrested in G0 upon serum deprivation. The mutant receptor was constitutively autophosphorylated, and several other cellular proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in absence of the ligand. Among these, the SHC adaptor protein was phosphorylated in absence of EGF, the other adaptor, GRB-2 was constitutively associated with the Glu627-EGF receptor in vivo and in vitro, and mitogen-activated protein kinase was constitutively phosphorylated. In contrast, other EGF receptor substrates, like phospholipase C gamma, were not phosphorylated in absence of EGF. The mutant receptor showed a higher sensitivity to cleavage by calpain both in absence and presence of EGF, appeared as a 170- and 150-kDa doublet in cell extracts, and a specific calpain inhibitor blocked the appearance of the 150-kDa form. Since the calpain cleavage site is located in the receptor cytoplasmic tail, this finding suggests that the Glu627 mutation induces a slightly different conformation in the EGF receptor intracellular domain. In conclusion, our data show that a point mutation in the EGF receptor transmembrane domain was able to constitutively activate the receptor and to induce transformation via constitutive activation of the Ras pathway.

15933712|t|Activating transcription factor 3, a stress sensor, activates p53 by blocking its ubiquitination.
15933712|t|Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is rapidly induced by diverse environmental insults including genotoxic stress. We report herein that its interaction with p53, enhanced by genotoxic stress, stabilizes the tumor suppressor thereby augmenting functions of the latter. Overexpression of ATF3 (but not a mutated ATF3 protein (Delta102-139) devoid of its p53-binding region) prevents p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation and leads to increased transcription from p53-regulated promoters. ATF3, but not the Delta102-139 protein, binds the p53 carboxy-terminus and diminishes its ubiquitination and nuclear export. Genotoxic-stressed ATF3-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, or cells in which ATF3 was reduced by small interference RNA, show inefficient p53 induction and impaired apoptosis compared with wild-type cells. ATF3-null cells (but not wild-type cells), which poorly accumulate p53, are transformed by oncogenic Ras. Thus, ATF3 is a novel stress-activated regulator of p53 protein stability/function providing the cell with a means of responding to a wide range of environmental insult, thus maintaining DNA integrity and protecting against cell transformation.

17640984|t|Phosphorylation of human insulin receptor substrate-1 at Serine 629 plays a positive role in insulin signaling.
17640984|t|The function of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is regulated by both tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of some serine/threonine residues in IRS-1 dampens insulin signaling, whereas phosphorylation of other serine/threonine residues enhances insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of human IRS-1 at Ser(629) was increased by insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the insulin receptor (1.26 +/- 0.09-fold; P < 0.05) and L6 cells (1.35 +/- 0.29-fold; P < 0.05) expressing human IRS-1. Sequence analysis surrounding Ser(629) revealed conformity to the consensus phosphorylation sequence recognized by Akt. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(629) in cells was decreased upon treatment with either an Akt inhibitor or by coexpression with kinase dead Akt, whereas Ser(629) phosphorylation was increased by coexpression with constitutively active Akt. In addition, Ser(629) of IRS-1 is directly phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. In cells, preventing phosphorylation of Ser(629) by a Ser(629)Ala mutation resulted in increased phosphorylation of Ser(636), a known negative regulator of IRS-1, without affecting phosphorylation of Tyr(632) or Ser(616). Cells expressing the Ser(629)Ala mutation, along with increased Ser(636) phosphorylation, had decreased insulin-stimulated association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase with IRS-1 and decreased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473). Finally, in vitro phosphorylation of a Ser(629)-containing IRS-1 fragment with Akt reduces the subsequent ability of ERK to phosphorylate Ser(636/639). These results suggest that a feed-forward mechanism may exist whereby insulin activation of Akt leads to phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(629), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser(636) and enhanced downstream signaling. Understanding the complex phosphorylation patterns of IRS-1 is crucial to elucidating the factors contributing to insulin resistance and, ultimately, the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

8700533|t|HER-2/c-erbB2 is phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II on a single site in the cytoplasmic tail at threonine-1172.
8700533|t|Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Cam kinase II) is known to desensitise epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-1) tyrosine kinase activity by a process involving phosphorylation at serines 1046/47 in the cytoplasmic tail. We have developed an experimental system to investigate phosphorylation of the related HER-2/c-erbB2 proto-oncogene utilising purified Cam kinase II and recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The cDNA for rat Cam kinase II-alpha was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 fibroblasts and the expressed protein purified to homogeneity by calmodulin-agarose affinity chromatography. A GST fusion protein comprising residues 1126-1255 of HER-2 was phosphorylated by purified Cam kinase II, in contrast to a GST protein comprising residues 1005-1125. Phosphoamino-acid analysis and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that HER-2 was phosphorylated on a single site at threonine-1172 which resides within a consensus Cam kinase II phosphorylation site (RAKT). HER-2 (threonine-1172-alanine), in the form of a ligand-inducible chimaera HER-1/2, was co-transfected into HEK-293 fibroblasts with a constitutively active form of Cam kinase II, followed by in vivo labelling of these cells with 32 P-orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation of ligand-activated receptors followed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping indicated that threonine-1172 in HER-2 is a newly identified in vivo site which can be hyper-phosphorylated by constitutively active Cam kinase II. In addition, when over-expressed in HEK-293 fibroblasts, HER-1/2 (threonine-1172-alanine) showed a defect in desensitisation and underwent a more sustained EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation compared to wild-type HER-1/2.

15247219|t|Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase by heat shock protein 90 and Src kinase activities.
15247219|t|Exposure of endothelial cells to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on site Tyr(407), an effect that required the association of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) with HSP90. The association of VEGFR2 with HSP90 involved the last 130 amino acids of VEGFR2 and was blocked by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of HSP90. Moreover, geldanamycin inhibited the VEGF-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which resulted in an inhibition of phosphorylation of FAK on site Tyr(407). In this context, the inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) with Y27632 or by expression of dominant negative forms of RhoA or ROCK impaired the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr(407) within FAK. In contrast to phosphorylation of Tyr(861), the phosphorylation of site Tyr(407) was insensitive to Src kinase inhibition by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2). We also found that the recruitment of paxillin to FAK was inhibited by geldanamycin but not by PP2, whereas both geldanamycin and PP2 inhibited the recruitment of vinculin to FAK. In accordance, the recruitment of paxillin and vinculin to FAK was inhibited in cells that express the mutant FAK-Y407F, whereas the expression of the mutant Y861F inhibited the recruitment of paxillin but not of vinculin. Importantly, cell migration was abolished in cells in which the signal from the VEGFR2-HSP90 pathway was blocked by the expression of Delta130VEGFR2, a deletant of VEGFR2 that does not associate with HSP90. Our findings underscore for the first time the key role played by the VEGFR2-HSP90-RhoA-ROCK-FAK/Tyr(407) pathway in transducing the VEGF signal that leads to the assembly of focal adhesions and endothelial cell migration.

21697482|t|Adenovirus type 5 early region 1B 55K oncoprotein-dependent degradation of cellular factor Daxx is required for efficient transformation of primary rodent cells.
21697482|t|Early region 1B 55K (E1B-55K) from adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) is a multifunctional regulator of lytic infection and contributes in vitro to complete cell transformation of primary rodent cells in combination with Ad5 E1A. Inhibition of p53 activated transcription plays a key role in processes by which E1B-55K executes its oncogenic potential. Nevertheless, additional functions of E1B-55K or further protein interactions with cellular factors of DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis, including Mre11, PML, and Daxx, may also contribute to the transformation process. In line with previous results, we performed mutational analysis to define a Daxx interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. The results from these studies showed that E1B-55K/Daxx binding is not required for inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or binding and degradation of cellular factors (p53/Mre11). Surprisingly, these mutants lost the ability to degrade Daxx and showed reduced transforming potential in primary rodent cells. In addition, we observed that E1B-55K lacking the SUMO-1 conjugation site (SCS/K104R) was sufficient for Daxx interaction but no longer capable of E1B-55K-dependent proteasomal degradation of the cellular factor Daxx. These results, together with the observation that E1B-55K SUMOylation is required for efficient transformation, provides evidence for the idea that SUMO-1-conjugated E1B-55K-mediated degradation of Daxx plays a key role in adenoviral oncogenic transformation. We assume that the viral protein contributes to cell transformation through the modulation of Daxx-dependent pathways. This further substantiates the assumption that further mechanisms for efficient transformation of primary cells can be separated from functions required for the inhibition of p53-stimulated transcription.

7530509|t|Constitutively activating mutations of c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase confer factor-independent growth and tumorigenicity of factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines.
7530509|t|The c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) is activated upon ligand binding, thereby leading to a variety of signaling events that play a fundamental role in hematopoiesis. In addition to ligand-dependent activation, we have previously shown that KIT is constitutively activated in a ligand-independent manner by two point mutations, Val-559-->Gly (G559) mutation in the juxtamembrane domain and Asp-814-->Val (V814) mutation in the phosphotransferase domain. To investigate the biochemical consequence and biologic significance of these mutations, retroviral vectors encoding KITG559 or KITV814 were introduced into murine pro-B-type Ba/F3 cells and myeloid FDC-P1 cells, both of which require interleukin-3 (IL-3) for their growth and survival. In the cells, KITG559 or KITV814 were found to be constitutively phophorylated on tyrosine in the absence of stem cell factor (SCF) that is a ligand for KIT. Chemical cross-linking analysis showed that a substantial fraction of the phosphorylated KITG559 underwent dimerization even in the absence of SCF, whereas the phosphorylated KITV814 did not, suggesting the distinct mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KIT by G559 and V814 mutations. Furthermore, the cells expressing either KITG559 or KITV814 were found to show a factor-independent growth, whereas the cells expressing wild-type KIT (KITWT) proliferated in response to SCF as well as IL-3. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of Ba/F3 cells expressing KITG559 or KITV814 into nude mice resulted in production of large tumors at all sites of the injection within 2 weeks, and all nude mice quickly succumbed to leukemia and died. These results suggest that, although the mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KITG559 or KITV814 may be different, both of the activating mutations have a function to induce a factor-independent and tumorigenic phenotype. Also, the data of this study raise the possibility that the constitutively activating mutations of c-kit may play a causal role in development of hematologic malignancies.

12149263|t|Galectin-1 augments Ras activation and diverts Ras signals to Raf-1 at the expense of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
12149263|t|Ras proteins activate diverse effector molecules. Depending on the cellular context, Ras activation may have different biological consequences: induction of cell proliferation, senescence, survival, or death. Augmentation and selective activation of particular effector molecules may underlie various Ras actions. In fact, Ras effector-loop mutants interacting with distinctive effectors provide evidence for such selectivity. Interactions of active Ras with escort proteins, such as galectin-1, could also direct Ras selectivity. Here we show that in comparison with Ras transfectants, H-Ras/galectin-1 or K-Ras4B/galectin-1 co-transfectants exhibit enhanced and prolonged epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP, Raf-1 activity, and active extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Galectin-1 antisense RNA inhibited these EGF responses. Conversely, Ras and galectin-1 co-transfection inhibited the EGF-stimulated increase in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Galectin-1 transfection also inhibited Ras(G12V)-induced PI3K but not Raf-1 activity. Galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Ras(G12V) or with Ras(G12V/T35S) that activate Raf-1 but not with Ras(G12V/Y40C) that activates PI3K. Thus, galectin-1 binds active Ras and diverts its signal to Raf-1 at the expense of PI3K. This demonstrates a novel mechanism controlling the duration and selectivity of the Ras signal. Ras gains selectivity when it is associated with galectin-1, mimicking the selectivity of Ras(T35S), which activates Raf-1 but not PI3K.

12052829|t|Serine/threonine phosphorylation of ShcA. Regulation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-pest binding and involvement in insulin signaling.
12052829|t|Serine phosphorylation of the ShcA signaling molecule has been reported recently. In this work, we have identified 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in p52(Shc) and p66(Shc). Among them, Ser(29) in p52(Shc) (equivalent to Ser(138) in p66(Shc)) was phosphorylated only after TPA stimulation. Phosphorylation of this site together with the intact phosphotyrosine-binding domain was essential for ShcA binding to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. TPA-induced ShcA phosphorylation at this site (and hence, its association with PTP-PEST) was inhibited by a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor and was induced by overexpression of constitutively active mutants of protein kinase Calpha, -epsilon, and -delta isoforms. Insulin also induced ShcA/PTP-PEST association, although to a lesser extent than TPA. Overexpression of a PTP-PEST binding-defective mutant of p52(Shc) (S29A) enhanced insulin-induced ERK activation in insulin receptor-overexpressing HIRc-B cells. Consistent with this, p52(Shc) S29A was more tyrosine-phosphorylated than wild-type p52(Shc) after insulin stimulation. Thus, we have identified a new mechanism whereby serine phosphorylation of ShcA controls the ability of its phosphotyrosine-binding domain to bind PTP-PEST, which is responsible for the dephosphorylation and down-regulation of ShcA after insulin stimulation.

9360957|t|The Fas receptor is a member of a family of cell death receptors, including tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFR I), death receptor 3 and 4 (DR3 and DR4), and cytopathic avian receptor 1 (CAR1). The Fas receptor is composed of several discrete domains, including three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain responsible for transmitting an apoptotic signal. While the mechanism of Fas-mediated cell death has become elucidated, the requirements for Fas ligand binding to the receptor have not been fully defined. Using a series of chimeric Fc-receptor fusion proteins between the human Fas receptor and TNFR I, each cysteine-rich domain of Fas was found to be required for interaction with the Fas ligand. Interestingly, TNFR I CRD1 could partially substitute for the Fas CRD1. The importance of this domain was underscored by the analysis of a Fas extracellular mutation (C66R), which resulted in a complete loss of ligand binding. This mutation was cloned from a human patient suffering from Canale-Smith syndrome, which is characterized by autoimmunity resembling that observed in the lpr and lprcg mice. The localization of essential ligand binding domains in the Fas receptor correlated exactly with the ability of the Fas receptor fusion proteins to prevent cell death mediated by the Fas ligand.

14962982|t|ZZ domain is essentially required for the physiological binding of dystrophin and utrophin to beta-dystroglycan.
14962982|t|An intracellular protein, dystrophin, plays an important role in keeping muscle fibers intact by binding at its N-terminal end to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal actin network and via its C-terminal end to the transmembraneous protein beta-dystroglycan. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by the loss of dystrophin, which can result from the loss of this binding. The N-terminal part of the latter binding site of dystrophin has been well documented using overlay assay and X-ray diffraction assays. However, the binding site at the C-terminal region of dystrophin has not been examined in detail. In the present work, we report a detailed analysis of the C-terminal binding domain as follows. (1). The full binding activity corresponding to the effective binding in vivo is expressed by the dystrophin fragment spanning amino acids 3026-3345 containing the ZZ domain at the C-terminus. Determination of this binding range is important not only for understanding of the mechanism of dystrophy, but also useful for the design of truncated dystrophin constructs for gene therapy. (2). The ZZ domain binds to EF1 domain in the dystrophin fragment to reinforce the binding activity. (3). The cysteine 3340 in the ZZ domain is essential for the binding of dystrophin to beta-dystroglycan. A reported case of DMD due to missense mutation C3340Y may be caused by inability to fix dystrophin beneath the cell membrane. (4). The binding mode of utrophin is different from that of dystrophin. The difference is conspicuous concerning the cysteine residues present in the ZZ domain.

9173873|t|Cysteine-200 of human inducible nitric oxide synthase is essential for dimerization of haem domains and for binding of haem, nitroarginine and tetrahydrobiopterin.
9173873|t|Nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39) is a homodimer. Limited proteolysis has previously shown that it consists of two major domains. The C-terminal or reductase domain binds FMN, FAD and NADPH. The N-terminal or oxygenase domain is known to bind arginine, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) and haem. The exact residues of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein involved in binding to these molecules have yet to be identified, although the haem moiety is known to be co-ordinated through a cysteine thiolate ligand. We have expressed two forms of the haem-binding domain of human iNOS (residues 1-504 and 59-504) in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The iNOS 1-504 and 59-504 fusion proteins bound similar amounts of haem, Nomega-nitro-l-arginine (nitroarginine) and tetrahydrobiopterin, showing that the first 58 residues are not required for binding these factors. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have mutated Cys-200, Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 and Cys-457 to alanine residues within the iNOS 59-504 haem-binding domain. Mutation of Cys-200 resulted in a complete loss of haem, nitroarginine and tetrahydrobiopterin binding. Mutants of Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 or Cys-457 showed no effect on the haem content of the fusion protein, no effect on the reduced CO spectral peak (444 nm) and were able to bind nitroarginine and tetrahydrobiopterin at levels equivalent to the wild-type fusion protein. After removal of the GST polypeptide, the wild-type iNOS 59-504 domain was dimeric, whereas the C200A mutant form was monomeric. When the mutated domains were incorporated into a reconstructed full-length iNOS protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes, only the Cys-200 mutant showed a loss of catalytic activity: all the other mutant iNOS proteins showed near wild-type enzymic activity. From this systematic approach we conclude that although Cys-217, Cys-228, Cys-290, Cys-384 and Cys-457 are conserved in all three NOS isoforms they are not essential for cofactor or substrate binding or for enzymic activity of iNOS, and that Cys-200 provides the proximal thiolate ligand for haem binding in human iNOS.

14660614|t|The 31-kDa caspase-generated cleavage product of p130cas functions as a transcriptional repressor of E2A in apoptotic cells.
14660614|t|In response to integrin receptor binding to the extracellular matrix, the multidomain docking protein p130(cas) (Crk-associated substrate) activates various signaling cascades modulating such cellular processes as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. During apoptosis, caspase-mediated cleavage of p130(cas) generated a C-terminal 31-kDa fragment (31-kDa) and promoted morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including loss of focal adhesions, cell rounding, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation. By contrast, a p130(cas) D748E mutant, which was unable to produce 31-kDa, attenuated the disassembly of focal adhesions at the bottom of the cell. 31-kDa contains a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain that shows greater sequence homology with Id proteins than with basic HLH proteins, which enabled heterodimerization with E2A. Once coupled to E2A, 31-kDa was translocated to the cell nucleus, where it inhibited E2A-mediated p21(Waf1/Cip1) transcription. Moreover, overexpression of 31-kDa led to cell death that could be inhibited by treatment with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketone or by ectopic expression of E2A or p21(Waf1/Cip1). These data suggest that during etoposide-induced apoptosis, 31-kDa promotes caspase-mediated cell death by inhibiting E2A-mediated activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) transcription.

19332559|t|TTK/hMps1 mediates the p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint by phosphorylating p53 at Thr18.
19332559|t|Upon prolonged arrest in mitosis, cells undergo adaptation and exit mitosis without cell division. These tetraploid cells are either eliminated by apoptosis or arrested in the subsequent G(1) phase in a spindle checkpoint- and p53-dependent manner. p53 has long been known to be activated by spindle poisons, such as nocodazole and Taxol, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we present evidence that stabilization and activation of p53 by spindle disruption requires the spindle checkpoint kinase TTK/hMps1. TTK/hMps1 phoshorylates the N-terminal domain of p53 at Thr18, and this phosphorylation disrupts the interaction with MDM2 and abrogates MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation at Thr18 enhances p53-dependent activation of not only p21 but also Lats2, two mediators of the postmitotic checkpoint. Furthermore, a phospho-mimicking substitution at Thr18 (T18D) is more competent than the phospho-deficient mutant (T18A) in rescuing the tetraploid checkpoint defect of p53-depleted cells. Our findings therefore provide a mechanism connecting the spindle checkpoint with p53 in the maintenance of genome stability.

11431472|t|Rim1 and rabphilin-3 bind Rab3-GTP by composite determinants partially related through N-terminal alpha -helix motifs.
11431472|t|Rim1 is a protein of the presynaptic active zone, the area of the plasma membrane specialized for neurotransmitter exocytosis, and interacts with Rab3, a small GTPase implicated in neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics. Here, we have studied the molecular determinants of Rim1 that are responsible for Rab3 binding, employing surface plasmon resonance and recombinant, bacterially expressed Rab3 and Rim1 proteins. A site that binds GTP- but not GDP-saturated Rab3 was localized to a short alpha-helical sequence near the Rim1 N terminus (amino acids 19-55). Rab3 isoforms A, C, and D were bound with similar affinities (K(d) = 1-2 microm). Low affinity binding of Rab6A-GTP was also observed (K(d) = 16 microm), whereas Rab1B, -5, -7, -8, or -11A did not bind. Adjacent sequences up to amino acid 387, encompassing differentially spliced sequences, the zinc finger module, and the SGAWFF motif of Rim1, did not significantly contribute to the strength or the specificity of Rab3 binding, whereas a point mutation within the helix (R33G) abolished binding. This Rab3 binding site of Rim1 is reminiscent of the N-terminal alpha-helix that is part of the Rab3-binding region of rabphilin-3, and indeed we observed low affinity, specific binding of Rab3A (K(d) on the order of magnitude of 10-100 microm) to this region of rabphilin-3 alone (amino acids 40-88), whereas additional sequences up to amino acid 178 are needed for high affinity Rab3A binding to rabphilin-3 (K(d) = 10-20 nm). In contrast, an N-terminal alpha-helix motif in aczonin, with sequence similarity to the Rab3-binding site of Rim1, did not bind Rab3A, -C, or -D or several other Rab proteins. These results were qualitatively confirmed in pull-down experiments with native, prenylated Rab3 from brain lysate in Triton X-100. Munc13 bound to the zinc finger domain of Rim1 but not to the rabphilin-3 or aczonin zinc fingers. Pull-down experiments from brain lysate in the presence of cholate as detergent detected binding to downstream Rim1 sequences, between amino acids 56 and 387, of syntaxin and of Rab3. The latter, however, was inhibited rather than stimulated by GTP.

10373493|t|Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent interactions between stimulatory effector proteins and the B cell co-receptor CD22.
10373493|t|The B cell-restricted transmembrane glycoprotein CD22 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor, thereby generating phosphotyrosine motifs in the cytoplasmic domain which recruit intracellular effector proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains. By virtue of its interaction with these effector proteins CD22 modulates signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor. To define further the molecular mechanism by which CD22 mediates its co-receptor function, phosphopeptide mapping experiments were conducted to determine which of the six tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are involved in recruitment of the stimulatory effector proteins phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb2, and Syk. The results obtained indicate that the protein tyrosine kinase Syk interacts with multiple CD22-derived phosphopeptides in both immunoprecipitation and reverse Far Western assays. In contrast, the Grb2.Sos complex was observed to bind exclusively to the fourth phosphotyrosine motif (Y828ENV) from CD22 and does so via a direct interaction based on Far Western and reverse Far Western blotting. Although both PLCgamma and PI3K were observed to bind to multiple phosphopeptides in precipitation experiments, subsequent studies using reverse Far Western blot analysis demonstrated that only the carboxyl-terminal phosphopeptide of CD22 (Y863VTL) binds directly to either one. This finding suggests that PLCgamma and PI3K may be recruited to CD22 either through a direct interaction with Tyr863 or indirectly through an association with one or more intermediate proteins.

10191192|t|Bean yellow dwarf virus RepA, but not rep, binds to maize retinoblastoma protein, and the virus tolerates mutations in the consensus binding motif.
10191192|t|It has previously been reported that complementary-sense gene products of wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a geminivirus of the genus Mastrevirus that infects monocotyledonous plants, bind to human and maize retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Rb proteins control cell-cycle progression by sequestering transcription factors required for entry into S-phase, suggesting that the virus modifies the cellular environment to produce conditions suitable for viral DNA replication. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we have investigated whether the complementary-sense gene products of bean yellow dwarf virus, a mastrevirus that is adapted to dicotyledonous plants, also bind maize Rb protein. We demonstrate that whereas RepA binds to Rb protein, Rep does not, suggesting that RepA alone regulates host gene expression and progression of cells to S-phase. RepA mutants containing L --> I, C --> S, C --> G, and E --> Q mutations within the consensus Rb protein binding motif LXCXE retained the ability to bind to Rb, but with reduced efficiency. Most notably, the E --> Q mutation reduced binding by approximately 95%. Nonetheless, all LXCXE mutants were able to replicate in tobacco protoplasts and to systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana and bean, in which they produced wild-type symptoms.

27287717|t|IKBKE Is a Substrate of EGFR and a Therapeutic Target in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Activating Mutations of EGFR.
27287717|t|Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) marked by EGFR mutations tend to develop resistance to therapeutic EGFR inhibitors, often due to secondary mutation EGFR(T790M) but also other mechanisms. Here we report support for a rationale to target IKBKE, an IκB kinase family member that activates the AKT and NF-κB pathways, as one strategy to address NSCLC resistant to EGFR inhibitors. While wild-type and mutant EGFR directly interacted with IKBKE, only mutant EGFR phosphorylated IKBKE on residues Y153 and Y179. The unphosphorylatable mutant IKBKE-Y153F/Y179-F that lost kinase activity failed to activate AKT and inhibited EGFR signaling. In clinical specimens of NSCLC with activating mutations of EGFR, we observed elevated levels of phospho-Y153 IKBKE. IKBKE ablation with shRNA or small-molecule inhibitor amlexanox selectively inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations in vitro In parallel, we found that these treatments activated the MAPK pathway due to attenuation of an IKBKE feedback mechanism. In vivo studies revealed that combining amlexanox with MEK inhibitor AZD6244 significantly inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of NSCLC cells harboring activating EGFR mutations, including EGFR(T790M) Overall, our findings define IKBKE as a direct effector target of EGFR and provide a therapeutic rationale to target IKBKE as a strategy to eradicate EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.

15580564|t|Molecular and functional analysis of intragenic SMN1 mutations in patients with spinal muscular atrophy.
15580564|t|The autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disease and frequent cause of early death in childhood, is caused in 96% of patients by homozygous absence of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). The severity of the disease is mainly determined by the copy number of SMN2, a copy gene which predominantly produces exon 7-skipped transcripts and only low amount of full-length transcripts that encode for a protein identical to SMN1. Only about 4% of SMA patients bear one SMN1 copy with an intragenic mutation. A comprehensive molecular genetic analysis of 34 SMA patients who carry one SMN1 gene is presented, including 18 that were previously published. Haplotype analysis with the microsatellite markers Ag1-CA and C212 in these SMA families turned out to be a reliable accessory method in predicting known SMN1 mutations in SMA patients carrying one SMN1 copy. Five novel missense mutations were identified that are localized in: exon 2a c.88G>A (p.D30N) and c.131A>T (p.D44V); exon 3 c.283G>C (p.G95R) and c.332C>G (p.A111G); and exon 6 c.784A>G (p.S262G), respectively. The survival motor neuron (SMN) protein has been shown to be a component of a large complex (termed the SMN complex) that promotes the formation of spliceosomal U small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Within this complex, SMN forms oligomers and directly interacts via its N-terminus with SMN-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) and via its central Tudor domain with spliceosomal (Sm) proteins. We performed in vitro interaction studies to test whether SMA-causing missense mutations identified in this study interfere with the reported interactions of SMN. Our results show that mutations p.G95R and p.A111G reduce SMN binding to Sm proteins, further confirming the previous finding that the Tudor domain is the essential binding site of SMN to Sm-proteins. However, all mutations, including those in exon 2a, a region shown to be important for the binding of SMN to SIP1, do not disturb the interaction of SMN to SIP1.

14645097|t|Kinetics of GPIbalpha-vWF-A1 tether bond under flow: effect of GPIbalpha mutations on the association and dissociation rates.
14645097|t|The interaction between platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and von Willebrand factor (vWF) is the first step of the hemostatic response to vessel injury. In platelet-type von Willebrand disease, two mutations, G233V and M239V, have been described within the Cys209-Cys248 disulfide loop of GPIbalpha that compromise hemostasis by increasing the affinity for vWF. We have earlier shown that converting other residues in this region to valine alters the affinity of GPIbalpha for vWF, with mutations K237V and Q232V, respectively, showing the greatest increase and decrease in affinity. Here, we investigated further the effect of these two mutations on the kinetics of the GPIbalpha interaction with the vWF-A1 domain under dynamic flow conditions. We measured the cellular on- and off-rate constants of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing GPIb-IX complexes containing wild-type or mutant GPIbalpha interacting with vWF-A1-coated surfaces at different shear stresses. We found that the gain-of-function mutant, K237V, rolled very slowly and continuously on vWF-A1 surface while the loss-of-function mutant, Q232V, showed fast, saltatory movement compared to the wild-type (WT). The off-rate constants, calculated based on the analysis of lifetimes of transient tethers formed on surfaces coated with limiting densities of vWF-A1, revealed that the Q232V and K237V dissociated 1.25-fold faster and 2.2-fold slower than the WT. The cellular on-rate constant of WT, measured in terms of tethering frequency, was threefold more and threefold less than Q232V and K237V, respectively. Thus, the gain- and loss-of-function mutations in GPIbalpha affect both the association and dissociation kinetics of the GPIbalpha-vWF-A1 bond. These findings are in contrast to the functionally similar selectin bonds where some of the mutations have been reported to affect only the dissociation rate.

16476738|t|Stimulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by cAMP involves putative ERK phosphorylation sites in the C termini of the channel's beta- and gamma-subunit.
16476738|t|The mechanisms involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) via the cAMP pathway are not yet completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate cAMP-mediated ENaC regulation in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing the three subunits (alphabetagamma) of rat ENaC and to determine the ENaC regions important for mediating the stimulatory effect of cAMP. In oocytes treated for about 24 h with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 microm forskolin (FSK) so as to increase intracellular cAMP, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (DeltaI(Ami)) was on average 10-fold larger than DeltaI(Ami) in matched control oocytes. This effect on DeltaI(Ami) was paralleled by an increase in ENaC surface expression caused by a reduced rate of ENaC retrieval. In addition, IBMX/FSK also enhanced ENaC open probability from about 0.2 to 0.5. The stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK was dependent on the presence of intact PY motifs in the C termini of the channel. Mutagenesis of putative protein kinase A and CK-2 consensus motifs in the cytosolic domains of the channel did not reveal critical sites involved in mediating the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of two putative ERK-consensus motifs (T613A in betaENaC and T623A in gammaENaC) largely reduced the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. Phosphorylation of these ERK sites has previously been reported to enhance the interaction of ENaC and Nedd4 (Shi, H., Asher, C., Chigaev, A., Yung, Y., Reuveny, E., Seger, R., and Garty, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13539-13547). Using co-expression experiments we demonstrated that mutating the two ERK sites attenuates the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC currents. We conclude that an increase in intracellular cAMP favors the dephosphorylation of the two ERK sites, which reduces channel retrieval and increases P(O) by modulating ENaC/Nedd4 interaction. This defines a novel regulatory pathway likely to be relevant for cAMP-induced stimulation of ENaC in vivo.

11867621|t|Aspartic acid 564 in the third cytoplasmic loop of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor is crucial for phosphorylation-independent interaction with arrestin2.
11867621|t|Arrestin2 binding to the active but unphosphorylated luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG R) in ovarian follicles is triggered by activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and leads to uncoupling of this receptor from cAMP signaling. We sought to determine how arrestin2 binds to LH/CG R, if binding is of high affinity, and if the receptor also binds arrestin3. Desensitization of intact LH/CG R was equally sensitive to ectopic constructs of arrestin2 that bind other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) either in a phosphorylation-independent or -dependent manner. Intact LH/CG R was not desensitized by ectopic arrestin3 constructs. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that arrestin2 bound a synthetic third intracellular (3i) LH/CG R loop peptide with picomolar affinity; arrestin3 bound with millimolar affinity. To determine whether Asp-564 in the 3i loop mimicked the phosphorylated residue of other GPCRs, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) and D564G LH/CG R. An agonist-stimulated ARF6-dependent arrestin2 undocking pathway to drive desensitization of WT receptor was recapitulated in HEK cell membranes, and ectopic arrestin2 promoted desensitization of WT LH/CG R. However, D564G LH/CG R in HEK cells was not desensitized, and synthetic 3i D564G peptide did not bind arrestin2. Synthetic 3i loop peptides containing D564E, D564V, or D564N also did not bind arrestin2. We conclude that the ARF6-mediated mechanism to release a pool of membrane-delimited arrestin to bind GPCRs may be a widespread mechanism to deliver arrestin to GPCRs for receptor desensitization. Unlike other GPCRs that additionally require receptor phosphorylation, LH/CG R activation is sufficient to expose a conformation in which Asp-564 in the 3i loop confers high affinity binding selectively to arrestin2.

1940342|t|The IL-2 receptor alpha-chain alters the binding of IL-2 to the beta-chain.
1940342|t|The binding of IL-2 to its high affinity receptor results in the formation of the ternary complex consisting of IL-2, alpha-chain (p55, Tac) and beta-chain (p75). We studied the role of alpha-chain in IL-2 binding to the high affinity receptor using IL-2 analog Lys20 which was made by the substitution of Lys for Asp20 of wild-type rIL-2. Lys20 bound to MT-1 cells solely expressing alpha-chain at low affinity, but did not bind to YT-2C2 cells which solely expressed beta-chain. However, direct binding of radiolabeled Lys20 to ED515-D cells, an HTLV-I-infected and IL-2-dependent T cell line, revealed both high affinity and low affinity binding although the Kd value of high affinity binding was 50 to 100 times higher than that of the high affinity binding of wild-type rIL-2. High affinity binding of Lys20 was completely blocked by 2R-B mAb recognizing IL-2R beta-chain. Anti-Tac mAb recognizing IL-2R alpha-chain abolished all of the specific Lys20 bindings. In contrast to the replacement of cell bound 2R-B mAb with wild-type rIL-2 at 37 degrees C, the addition of an excess of Lys20 did not cause the detachment of cell-bound radiolabeled or FITC-labeled 2R-B mAb. Consistent with the results of binding studies, Lys20 induced the proliferation of ED515-D cells, but not large granular lymphocyte leukemic cells. The growth of ED-515D cells was completely suppressed by either anti-Tac mAb or 2R-B mAb. These results strongly suggest that coexpression of the IL-2R alpha- and beta-chains alters the binding affinity of Lys20 and that the interaction between IL-2 and the alpha-chain is a key event in the formation of the IL-2/IL-2R ternary complex.

15014082|t|Requirement for ATP by the DNA damage checkpoint clamp loader.
15014082|t|The DNA damage clamp loader replication factor C (RFC-Rad24) consists of the Rad24 protein and the four small Rfc2-5 subunits of RFC. This complex loads the heterotrimeric DNA damage clamp consisting of Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1 (Rad17/3/1) onto partial duplex DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Interactions between the clamp loader and the clamp have been proposed to mirror those of the replication clamp loader RFC and the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In that system, three ATP molecules bound to the Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc4 subunits are necessary and sufficient for efficient loading of PCNA, whereas ATP binding to Rfc1 is not required. In contrast, in this study, we show that mutant RFC-Rad24 with a rad24-K115E mutation in the ATP-binding domain of Rad24 shows defects in the ATPase of the complex and is defective for interaction with Rad17/3/1 and for loading of the checkpoint clamp. A similar defect was measured with a mutant RFC-Rad24 clamp loader carrying a rfc4K55R ATP-binding mutation, whereas the rfc4K55E clamp loader showed partial loading activity, in agreement with genetic studies of these mutants. These studies show that ATP utilization by the checkpoint clamp/clamp loader system is effectively different from that by the structurally analogous replication system.

7589433|t|Interaction of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with insulin and IGF-1 receptors analysed by using the two-hybrid system.
7589433|t|Interaction of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) was investigated using the two-hybrid system by assessing for his3 and lacZ activation in S. cerevisiae. The experiments were performed with the cytoplasmic beta domain (wild type or mutated) of IR and IGF-1R and p85 or its subdomains (N + C-SH2, N-SH2, C-SH2, SH3 + N-SH2). The results of his3 activation indicated that p85, N + C-SH2 and C-SH2 interact with both IR beta and IGF-1R beta, whereas N-SH2 and SH3 + N-SH2 interact only with IR beta. Interaction of p85 and N+C-SH2 with IR beta (delta C-43) or IGF-1R beta(delta C-43) in which the C-terminal 43 amino acids (including the YXXM motif) were deleted, persisted. The internal binding site thus revealed was not altered by further mutating Y960/F for IR or Y950/F for IGF-1R. Activation of lacZ upon interaction of p85 with IR beta(delta C-43) was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta. This activation with p85 and IGF-1R beta was 4-fold less as compared to IR beta and was somewhat increased (2-fold) for IGF-1R beta (delta C-43). Thus, the C-terminal domain in IGF-1R appears to exert a negative control on binding of p85 thereby providing a possible regulatory mechanism for direct activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway.

8959326|t|Multiple in vivo phosphorylated tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 engages binding to Grb2 via tyrosine 584.
8959326|t|SHP-2 (also named PTP1D, syp, or SH-PTP2) has been identified as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase comprising two src-homology-2 (SH2) domains. Upon growth factor stimulation, SHP-2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated, thereby increasing its catalytic activity. Here, we identified SHP-2 to be phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues in response to different stimuli and unmasked the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine 584 as a major phosphorylation site in human cell lines. Tyrosine 584 shares, together with tyrosine 546, the consensus sequence pY-X-N-X, a characteristic of potential binding sites for the SH2 domain of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). We show here that mutation of tyrosine 584, but not tyrosine 546, to phenylalanine totally abolished the binding of Grb2 to SHP-2. By using a systematic mutagenesis approach, phosphorylation of additional tyrosines in each of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 was detected after coexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor, but not after coexpression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, whereas tyrosine 263 located in the interspace between SH2 and catalytic domain appears to be exclusively recognized by platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Immunoprecipitation of SHP-2 from a panel of mammary carcinoma cell lines copurifies several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins; the most prominent band has an apparent molecular weight of M(r) 115,000.

26628682|t|Identifying three-dimensional structures of autophosphorylation complexes in crystals of protein kinases.
26628682|t|Protein kinase autophosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism in cell signaling pathways. Crystal structures of several homomeric protein kinase complexes have a serine, threonine, or tyrosine autophosphorylation site of one kinase monomer located in the active site of another monomer, a structural complex that we call an "autophosphorylation complex." We developed and applied a structural bioinformatics method to identify all such autophosphorylation complexes in x-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We identified 15 autophosphorylation complexes in the PDB, of which five complexes had not previously been described in the publications describing the crystal structures. These five complexes consist of tyrosine residues in the N-terminal juxtamembrane regions of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R, Tyr(561)) and ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2, Tyr(594)), tyrosine residues in the activation loops of the SRC kinase family member LCK (Tyr(394)) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R, Tyr(1166)), and a serine in a nuclear localization signal region of CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2, Ser(142)). Mutations in the complex interface may alter autophosphorylation activity and contribute to disease; therefore, we mutated residues in the autophosphorylation complex interface of LCK and found that two mutations impaired autophosphorylation (T445V and N446A) and mutation of Pro(447) to Ala, Gly, or Leu increased autophosphorylation. The identified autophosphorylation sites are conserved in many kinases, suggesting that, by homology, these complexes may provide insight into autophosphorylation complex interfaces of kinases that are relevant drug targets.

9560220|t|Association of calcium channel alpha1S and beta1a subunits is required for the targeting of beta1a but not of alpha1S into skeletal muscle triads.
9560220|t|The skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel is a complex of five subunits that is specifically localized in the triad. Its primary function is the rapid activation of Ca2+ release from cytoplasmic stores in a process called excitation-contraction coupling. To study the role of alpha1S-beta1a interactions in the incorporation of the functional channel complex into the triad, alpha1S and beta1a [or a beta1a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein] were expressed alone and in combination in myotubes of the dysgenic cell line GLT. betaGFP expressed in dysgenic myotubes that lack the skeletal muscle alpha1S subunit was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. On coexpression with the alpha1S subunit betaGFP distribution became clustered and colocalized with alpha1S immunofluorescence. Based on the colocalization of betaGFP and alpha1S with the ryanodine receptor the clusters were identified as T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions. Expression of alpha1S with and without beta1a restored Ca2+ currents and depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. The translocation of betaGFP from the cytoplasm into the junctions failed when betaGFP was coexpressed with alpha1S mutants in which the beta interaction domain had been altered (alpha1S-Y366S) or deleted (alpha1S-Delta351-380). Although alpha1S-Y366S did not associate with betaGFP it was incorporated into the junctions, and it restored Ca2+ currents and depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, beta1a requires the association with the beta interaction domain in the I-II cytoplasmic loop of alpha1S for its own incorporation into triad junctions, but stable alpha1S-beta1a association is not necessary for the targeting of alpha1S into the triads or for its normal function in Ca2+ conductance and excitation-contraction coupling.

21741389|t|Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase is dependent on its interaction with globular actin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
21741389|t|Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) has been reported to associate with globular actin, and this association increases eNOS activity. Adenosine, histamine, salbutamol and thrombin cause activation of eNOS through widely different mechanisms. Whether these eNOS agonists can regulate eNOS activity through affecting its association with actin is unknown. As previously reported, we confirmed in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) that histamine and thrombin increased intracellular Ca(2+) whereas adenosine and salbutamol did not, and that these four agonists caused different effects on actin filament structure. Nevertheless, despite their divergent effects on intracellular Ca(2+) and on actin filament structure, we found by immunoprecipitation that adenosine, histamine, salbutamol and thrombin all caused an increase in association between eNOS and globular actin. This increase of association was inhibited by pre-treatment with phalloidin, an actin filament stabilizer. All of these agonists also increased phosphorylation of eNOS on serine residue 1177, eNOS activity, and cyclic guanosine-3', 5'-monophosphate, and these increases were all attenuated by phalloidin. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of eNOS on serine 1177 was attenuated by Akt inhibition, whereas association of eNOS with actin was not. We also found, in HEK-293 cells transfected with the eNOS mutants eNOS-S1177A or eNOS-S1177D, that the association between eNOS and globular actin was decreased as compared to cells transfected with wild-type eNOS. We conclude that association of globular actin with eNOS plays an essential and necessary role in agonist-induced eNOS activation, through enabling its phosphorylation by Akt at serine residue 1177.

18199681|t|A pachygyria-causing alpha-tubulin mutation results in inefficient cycling with CCT and a deficient interaction with TBCB.
18199681|t|The agyria (lissencephaly)/pachygyria phenotypes are catastrophic developmental diseases characterized by abnormal folds on the surface of the brain and disorganized cortical layering. In addition to mutations in at least four genes--LIS1, DCX, ARX and RELN--mutations in a human alpha-tubulin gene, TUBA1A, have recently been identified that cause these diseases. Here, we show that one such mutation, R264C, leads to a diminished capacity of de novo tubulin heterodimer formation. We identify the mechanisms that contribute to this defect. First, there is a reduced efficiency whereby quasinative alpha-tubulin folding intermediates are generated via ATP-dependent interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT. Second, there is a failure of CCT-generated folding intermediates to stably interact with TBCB, one of the five tubulin chaperones (TBCA-E) that participate in the pathway leading to the de novo assembly of the tubulin heterodimer. We describe the behavior of the R264C mutation in terms of its effect on the structural integrity of alpha-tubulin and its interaction with TBCB. In spite of its compromised folding efficiency, R264C molecules that do productively assemble into heterodimers are capable of copolymerizing into dynamic microtubules in vivo. The diminished production of TUBA1A tubulin in R264C individuals is consistent with haploinsufficiency as a cause of the disease phenotype.

15134438|t|Interaction of the retinal insulin receptor beta-subunit with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
15134438|t|Recently, we have shown that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in retina is regulated in vivo through light activation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit. In this study, we have cloned the 41 kDa cytoplasmic region of the retinal insulin receptor (IRbeta) and used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate the interaction between the p85 subunit of PI3K and the cytoplasmic region of IRbeta. Under conditions where IRbeta autophosphorylates, substitution of Y1322F and M1325P in IRbeta resulted in the abolition of p85 binding to the IRbeta, confirming that the p85 subunit of PI3K binds to Y1322. The binding site for p85 on IRbeta was also confirmed in the yeast three-hybrid system. Using the C-terminal region of IRbeta (amino acids 1293-1343 encompassing the YHTM motif) as bait and supplying an exogenous tyrosine kinase gene to yeast cells, we determined that the IRbeta-pYTHM motif interacts with p85. We also used retinal organ cultures to demonstrate insulin activation of the insulin receptor and subsequent binding of p85, measured through GST pull-down assays with p85 fusion proteins. Further, the Y960F mutant insulin receptor, which does not bind IRS-1, is capable of bringing down PI3K activity from retina lysates. On the other hand, in response to insulin, IRS-2 is able to interact with the p85 subunit of PI3K in the retina. These results suggest that multiple signaling pathways could regulate the PI3K activity and subsequent activation of Akt in the retina.

12857726|t|The tyrosine phosphatase 1B regulates linker for activation of T-cell phosphorylation and platelet aggregation upon FcgammaRIIa cross-linking.
12857726|t|Human platelets express the receptor for immunoglobulin G, FcgammaRIIa, that triggers cell aggregation upon interaction with immune complexes. Here, we report that the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the Linker for Activation of T-cell (LAT) in human platelets stimulated by FcgammaRIIa cross-linking was followed by its complete dephosphorylation in an alphaIIb/beta3 integrin-dependent manner. Concomitant to LAT dephosphorylation, the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was activated through a mechanism involving its proteolysis by calpains downstream of integrins. Both PTP1B and LAT were associated with the actin cytoskeleton complex formed during platelet aggregation. Moreover, phospho-LAT appeared as a good substrate of activated PTP1B in vitro and these two proteins interacted upon platelet activation by FcgammaRIIa cross-linking. The permeant substrate-trapping PTP1B (TAT-PTP1B D181A) partly inhibited LAT dephosphorylation in human platelets, strongly suggesting that this tyrosine phosphatase was involved in this regulatory pathway. Using a pharmacological inhibitor, we provide evidence that PTP1B activation and LAT dephosphorylation processes were required for irreversible platelet aggregation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that PTP1B plays an important role in the integrin-mediated dephosphorylation of LAT in human platelets and is involved in the control of irreversible aggregation upon FcgammaRIIa stimulation.

22233518|t|Interaction of a bacterial flagellar chaperone FlgN with FlhA is required for efficient export of its cognate substrates.
22233518|t|FlgN chaperone acts as a bodyguard to protect its cognate substrates, FlgK and FlgL, from proteolysis in the cytoplasm. Docking of the FlgN-FlgK complex with the FliI ATPase of the flagellar type III export apparatus is key to the protein export process. However, a ΔfliH-fliI flhB(P28T) mutant forms some flagella even in the absence of FliH and FliI, raising the question of how FlgN promotes the export of its cognate substrates. Here, we report that the interaction of FlgN with an integral membrane export protein, FlhA, is directly involved in efficient protein export. A ΔfliH-fliI flhB(P28T) ΔflgN mutant caused extragenic suppressor mutations in the C-terminal domain of FlhA (FlhA(C) ). Pull-down assays using GST affinity chromatography showed an interaction between FlgN and FlhA(C) . The FlgN-FlgK complex bound to FlhA(C) and FliJ to form the FlgN-FlgK-FliJ-FlhA(C) complex. The FlgN-FlhA(C) interaction was enhanced by FlgK but not by FliJ. FlgN120 missing the last 20 residues still bound to FlgK and FliJ but not to FlhA(C) . A highly conserved Tyr-122 residue was required for the interaction with FlhA(C) . These results suggest that FlgN efficiently transfers FlgK/L subunits to FlhA(C) to promote their export.

10196222|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor induces phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2.
10196222|t|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival. Gaining an understanding of how BDNF, via the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) receptor, elicits specific cellular responses is of contemporary interest. Expression of mutant TrkB in fibroblasts, where tyrosine 484 was changed to phenylalanine, abrogated Shc association with TrkB, but only attenuated and did not block BDNF-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This suggests there is another BDNF-induced signaling mechanism for activating MAPK, which compelled a search for other TrkB substrates. BDNF induces phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) in both fibroblasts engineered to express TrkB and human neuroblastoma (NB) cells that naturally express TrkB. Additionally, BDNF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 in primary cultures of cortical neurons, thus showing that FRS2 is a physiologically relevant substrate of TrkB. Data are presented demonstrating that BDNF induces association of FRS2 with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (GRB2) in cortical neurons, fibroblasts, and NB cells, which in turn could activate the RAS/MAPK pathway. This is not dependent on Shc, since BDNF does not induce association of Shc and FRS2. Finally, the experiments suggest that FRS2 and suc-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target are the same protein.

21482671|t|IkappaB kinase beta promotes cell survival by antagonizing p53 functions through DeltaNp73alpha phosphorylation and stabilization.
21482671|t|ΔNp73α, a dominant-negative inhibitor of p53 and p73, exhibits antiapoptotic and transforming activity in in vitro models and is often found to be upregulated in human cancers. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of ΔNp73α protein levels in normal and cancer cells are poorly characterized. Here, we show that that IκB kinase beta (IKKβ) increases ΔNp73α protein stability independently of its ability to activate NF-κB. IKKβ associates with and phosphorylates ΔNp73α at serine 422 (S422), leading to its accumulation in the nucleus, where it binds and represses several p53-regulated genes. S422A mutation in ΔNp73α abolished IKKβ-mediated stabilization and inhibition of p53-regulated gene expression. Inhibition of IKKβ activity by chemical inhibitors, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants, or gene silencing by siRNA also resulted in ΔNp73α destabilization, which under these conditions was rapidly translocated into the cytoplasm and degraded by a calpain-mediated mechanism. We also present evidence for the IKKβ and ΔNp73α cross talk in cancer-derived cell lines and primary cancers. Our data unveil a new mechanism involved in the regulation of the p73 and p53 network.

14985338|t|Phosphorylation of syntaphilin by cAMP-dependent protein kinase modulates its interaction with syntaxin-1 and annuls its inhibitory effect on vesicle exocytosis.
14985338|t|cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can modulate synaptic transmission by acting directly on the neurotransmitter secretory machinery. Here, we identify one possible target: syntaphilin, which was identified as a molecular clamp that controls free syntaxin-1 and dynamin-1 availability and thereby regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpoint dominant PKA phosphorylation sites to serines 43 and 56. PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin significantly decreases its binding to syntaxin-1A in vitro. A syntaphilin mutation of serine 43 to aspartic acid (S43D) shows similar effects on binding. To characterize in vivo phosphorylation events, we generated antisera against a peptide of syntaphilin containing a phosphorylated serine 43. Treatment of rat brain synaptosomes or syntaphilin-transfected HEK 293 cells with the cAMP analogue BIMPS induces in vivo phosphorylation of syntaphilin and inhibits its interaction with syntaxin-1 in neurons. To determine whether PKA phosphorylation of syntaphilin is involved in the regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, we investigated the effect of overexpression of syntaphilin and its S43D mutant on the regulated secretion of human growth hormone from PC12 cells. Although expression of wild type syntaphilin in PC12 cells exhibits significant reduction in high K(+)-induced human growth hormone release, the S43D mutant fails to inhibit exocytosis. Our data predict that syntaphilin could be a highly regulated molecule and that PKA phosphorylation could act as an "off" switch for syntaphilin, thus blocking its inhibitory function via the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathway.

27657329|t|Phosphorylation of Def Regulates Nucleolar p53 Turnover and Cell Cycle Progression through Def Recruitment of Calpain3.
27657329|t|Digestive organ expansion factor (Def) is a nucleolar protein that plays dual functions: it serves as a component of the ribosomal small subunit processome for the biogenesis of ribosomes and also mediates p53 degradation through the cysteine proteinase calpain-3 (CAPN3). However, nothing is known about the exact relationship between Def and CAPN3 or the regulation of the Def function. In this report, we show that CAPN3 degrades p53 and its mutant proteins p53A138V, p53M237I, p53R248W, and p53R273P but not the p53R175H mutant protein. Importantly, we show that Def directly interacts with CAPN3 in the nucleoli and determines the nucleolar localisation of CAPN3, which is a prerequisite for the degradation of p53 in the nucleolus. Furthermore, we find that Def is modified by phosphorylation at five serine residues: S50, S58, S62, S87, and S92. We further show that simultaneous phosphorylations at S87 and S92 facilitate the nucleolar localisation of Capn3 that is not only essential for the degradation of p53 but is also important for regulating cell cycle progression. Hence, we propose that the Def-CAPN3 pathway serves as a nucleolar checkpoint for cell proliferation by selective inactivation of cell cycle-related substrates during organogenesis.

Chem. 272, 15980-15985), synaptojanin is identified as a protein that inhibits phospholipase D (PLD) activity stimulated by ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here, the purification from rat brain cytosol of another PLD-inhibitory protein that is immunologically distinct from synaptojanin is described, and this protein is identified as clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP3) by peptide sequencing and immunoblot analysis. AP3 binds both inositol hexakisphosphate and preassembled clathrin cages with high affinity. However, neither inositol hexakisphosphate binding nor clathrin cage binding affected the ability of AP3 to inhibit PLD. AP3 also binds to PI(4,5)P2 with low affinity. But the PI(4,5)P2 binding was not responsible for PLD inhibition, because the potency and efficacy of AP3 as an inhibitor of PLD were similar in the absence and presence of PI(4,5)P2. A bacterially expressed fusion protein, glutathione S-transferase-AP3 (GST-AP3), also inhibited PLD with a potency equal to that of brain AP3. The inhibitory effect of AP3 appeared to be the result of direct interaction between AP3 and PLD because PLD bound GST-AP3 in an in vitro binding assay. Using GST fusion proteins containing various AP3 sequences, we found that the sequence extending from residues Pro-290 to Lys-320 of AP3 is critical for both inhibition of and binding to PLD. The fact that AP3 is a synapse-specific protein indicates that the AP3-dependent inhibition of PLD might play a regulatory role that is restricted to the rapid cycling of synaptic vesicles.

7692233|t|Two signaling molecules share a phosphotyrosine-containing binding site in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
7692233|t|Autophosphorylation sites of growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity function as specific binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of signaling molecules. This interaction appears to be a crucial step in a mechanism by which receptor tyrosine kinases relay signals to downstream signaling pathways. Nck is a widely expressed protein consisting exclusively of SH2 and SH3 domains, the overexpression of which causes cell transformation. It has been shown that various growth factors stimulate the phosphorylation of Nck and its association with autophosphorylated growth factor receptors. A panel of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor mutations at tyrosine residues has been used to identify the Nck binding site. Here we show that mutation at Tyr-751 of the PDGF beta-receptor eliminates Nck binding both in vitro and in living cells. Moreover, the Y751F PDGF receptor mutant failed to mediate PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Nck in intact cells. A phosphorylated Tyr-751 is also required for binding of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase to the PDGF receptor. Hence, the SH2 domains of p85 and Nck share a binding site in the PDGF receptor. Competition experiments with different phosphopeptides derived from the PDGF receptor suggest that binding of Nck and p85 is influenced by different residues around Tyr-751. Thus, a single tyrosine autophosphorylation site is able to link the PDGF receptor to two distinct SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules.

19690147|t|Sprouty2 association with B-Raf is regulated by phosphorylation and kinase conformation.
19690147|t|Sprouty2 is a feedback regulator that controls the Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway at multiple levels, one way being through direct interaction with Raf kinases. Consistent with a role as a tumor suppressor, Sprouty2 expression is often down-regulated in human cancers. However, Sprouty2 is up-regulated in some cancers, suggesting the existence of posttranscriptional mechanisms that permit evasion of Sprouty2-mediated antitumorigenic properties. We report that MAPK activation induces Sprouty2 phosphorylation on six serine residues, which reduced Sprouty2 association with wild-type B-Raf. Mutation of these six serines to nonphosphorylatable alanines increased the ability of Sprouty2 to inhibit growth factor-induced MAPK activation. Oncogenic B-Raf mutants such as B-Raf V600E did not associate with Sprouty2, but this resistance to Sprouty2 binding was not due to phosphorylation. Instead, the active kinase conformation induced by oncogenic mutation prevents Sprouty2 binding. These results reveal a dual mechanism that affects the Sprouty2/B-Raf interaction: Sprouty phosphorylation and B-Raf conformation.

9973410|t|Interaction of murine MHC class I molecules with tapasin and TAP enhances peptide loading and involves the heavy chain alpha3 domain.
9973410|t|In human cells the association of MHC class I molecules with TAP is thought to be mediated by a third protein termed tapasin. We now show that tapasin is present in murine TAP-class I complexes as well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a mutant H-2Dd molecule that does not interact with TAP due to a Glu to Lys mutation at residue 222 of the H chain (Dd(E222K)) also fails to bind to tapasin. This finding supports the view that tapasin bridges the association between class I and TAP and implicates residue 222 as a site of contact with tapasin. The inability of Dd(E222K) to interact with tapasin and TAP results in impaired peptide loading within the endoplasmic reticulum. However, significant acquisition of peptides can still be detected as assessed by the decay kinetics of cell surface Dd(E222K) molecules and by the finding that prolonged viral infection accumulates sufficient target structures to stimulate T cells at 50% the level observed with wild-type Dd. Thus, although interaction with tapasin and TAP enhances peptide loading, it is not essential. Finally, a cohort of Dd(E222K) molecules decays more rapidly on the cell surface compared with wild-type Dd molecules but much more slowly than peptide-deficient molecules. This suggests that some of the peptides obtained in the absence of an interaction with tapasin and TAP are suboptimal, suggesting a peptide-editing function for tapasin/TAP in addition to their role in enhancing peptide loading.

15659546|t|Cellular transformation by the MSP58 oncogene is inhibited by its physical interaction with the PTEN tumor suppressor.
15659546|t|The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) tumor suppressor protein contains a single catalytic domain with both lipid and protein phosphatase activities. The remaining C-terminal half of the PTEN protein plays a role in its stability and is mutated in many clinical cancer samples. Here, we report that the PTEN C-terminal domain physically interacts with the forkhead-associated domain of the oncogenic MSP58 protein and that this interaction requires PTEN Thr-366. We further show that while MSP58 transforms Pten-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), concurrent introduction of wild-type PTEN causes a dramatic reduction in the number of MSP58-induced transformed foci. This PTEN-mediated inhibition of cellular transformation requires physical interaction as evidenced by the failure of PTEN(T366A) point mutation (residing within the MSP58 interaction domain) to suppress MSP-58-driven transformation. These observations, together with the capacity of catalytically inactive PTEN mutant (G129R) to suppress MSP58 oncogenicity, support the view that the C-terminal region of PTEN directly provides a previously uncharacterized biological function in its ability to regulate cellular transformation.

9786907|t|The open reading frame III product of cauliflower mosaic virus forms a tetramer through a N-terminal coiled-coil.
9786907|t|The open reading frame III product of cauliflower mosaic virus is a protein of 15 kDa (p15) that is essential for the virus life cycle. It was shown that the 34 N-terminal amino acids are sufficient to support protein-protein interaction with the full-length p15 in the yeast two-hybrid system. A corresponding peptide was synthesized and a recombinant p15 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the peptide and the full-length protein can assume an alpha-helical conformation. Analytical centrifugation allowed to determine that p15 assembles as a rod-shaped tetramer. Oxidative cross-linking of N-terminal cysteines of the peptide generated specific covalent oligomers, indicating that the N terminus of p15 is a coiled-coil that assembles as a parallel tetramer. Mutation of Lys22 into Asp destabilized the tetramer and put forward the presence of a salt bridge between Lys22 and Asp24 in a model building of the stalk. These results suggest a model in which the stalk segment of p15 is located at its N terminus, followed by a hinge that provides the space for presenting the C terminus for interactions with nucleic acids and/or proteins.

22623798|t|Characterization of a viral phosphoprotein binding site on the surface of the respiratory syncytial nucleoprotein.
22623798|t|The human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) genome is composed of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA that is tightly associated with the nucleoprotein (N). This ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is the template for replication and transcription by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RNP recognition by the viral polymerase involves a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein (P) (P(CTD)) and N. However, the P binding region on N remains to be identified. In this study, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays were used to identify the N-terminal core domain of HRSV N (N(NTD)) as a P binding domain. A biochemical characterization of the P(CTD) and molecular modeling of the N(NTD) allowed us to define four potential candidate pockets on N (pocket I [PI] to PIV) as hydrophobic sites surrounded by positively charged regions, which could constitute sites complementary to the P(CTD) interaction domain. The role of selected amino acids in the recognition of the N-RNA complex by P was first screened for by site-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase activity assay, based on an HRSV minigenome containing a luciferase reporter gene. When changed to Ala, most of the residues of PI were found to be critical for viral RNA synthesis, with the R132A mutant having the strongest effect. These mutations also reduced or abolished in vitro and in vivo P-N interactions, as determined by GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments. The pocket formed by these residues is critical for P binding to the N-RNA complex, is specific for pneumovirus N proteins, and is clearly distinct from the P binding sites identified so far for other nonsegmented negative-strand viruses.

8557678|t|Calcium-dependent binding of S100C to the N-terminal domain of annexin I.
8557678|t|The annexin family of proteins is characterized by a conserved core domain that binds to phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Each annexin also has a structurally distinct N-terminal domain that may impart functional specificity. To search for cellular proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of annexin I, we constructed a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase fused to amino acids 2-47 of human annexin I (GST-AINT; AINT = annexin I N-terminal). Extracts from metabolically labeled A431 cells contained a single protein (M(r) approximately 10,000) that bound to GST-AINT in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-18 of annexin I inhibited the binding of the 10-kDa protein to GST-AINT with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 15 microM peptide. In cellular extracts, endogenous annexin I and the 10-kDa protein associated in a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Experiments with other annexins and with N-terminal truncated forms of annexin I indicated that the 10-kDa protein bound specifically to a site within the first 12 amino acids of annexin I. The 10-kDa protein was purified from human placenta by hydrophobic and affinity chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the 10-kDa protein is the human homologue of S100C, a recently identified member of the S100 subfamily of EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins.

20159986|t|Methylation of ribosomal protein S10 by protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 regulates ribosome biogenesis.
20159986|t|Modulation of ribosomal assembly is a fine tuning mechanism for cell number and organ size control. Many ribosomal proteins undergo post-translational modification, but their exact roles remain elusive. Here, we report that ribosomal protein s10 (RPS10) is a novel substrate of an oncoprotein, protein-arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). We show that PRMT5 interacts with RPS10 and catalyzes its methylation at the Arg(158) and Arg(160) residues. The methylation of RPS10 at Arg(158) and Arg(160) plays a role in the proper assembly of ribosomes, protein synthesis, and optimal cell proliferation. The RPS10-R158K/R160K mutant is not efficiently assembled into ribosomes and is unstable and prone to degradation by the proteasomal pathway. In nucleoli, RPS10 interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 and is predominantly concentrated in the granular component region, which is required for ribosome assembly. The RPS10 methylation mutant interacts weakly with nucleophosmin/B23 and fails to concentrate in the granular component region. Our results suggest that PRMT5 is likely to regulate cell proliferation through the methylation of ribosome proteins, and thus reveal a novel mechanism for PRMT5 in tumorigenesis.

23264647|t|Control of polarized growth by the Rho family GTPase Rho4 in budding yeast: requirement of the N-terminal extension of Rho4 and regulation by the Rho GTPase-activating protein Bem2.
23264647|t|In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rho4 GTPase partially plays a redundant role with Rho3 in the control of polarized growth, as deletion of RHO4 and RHO3 together, but not RHO4 alone, caused lethality and a loss of cell polarity at 30°C. Here, we show that overexpression of the constitutively active rho4(Q131L) mutant in an rdi1Δ strain caused a severe growth defect and generated large, round, unbudded cells, suggesting that an excess of Rho4 activity could block bud emergence. We also generated four temperature-sensitive rho4-Ts alleles in a rho3Δ rho4Δ strain. These mutants showed growth and morphological defects at 37°C. Interestingly, two rho4-Ts alleles contain mutations that cause amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of Rho4. Rho4 possesses a long N-terminal extension that is unique among the six Rho GTPases in the budding yeast but is common in Rho4 homologs in other yeasts and filamentous fungi. We show that the N-terminal extension plays an important role in Rho4 function since rho3Δ rho4(Δ)(61) cells expressing truncated Rho4 lacking amino acids (aa) 1 to 61 exhibited morphological defects at 24°C and a growth defect at 37°C. Furthermore, we show that Rho4 interacts with Bem2, a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) for Cdc42 and Rho1, by yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays. Bem2 specifically interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rho4, and the interaction is mediated by its RhoGAP domain. Overexpression of BEM2 aggravates the defects of rho3Δ rho4 mutants. These results suggest that Bem2 might be a novel GAP for Rho4.

26531778|t|Ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein-50 regulates EGF-induced AKT activation through interaction with EGFR and PTEN.
26531778|t|Dysregulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, especially EGFR/AKT signaling, plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progression, the study on intracellular regulation of this signaling pathway has great clinical significance. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is an important antagonist of AKT activity. Its regulation of AKT activity can be enhanced by ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein-50 (EBP50)-mediated PTEN/EBP50/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) complex. EBP50 was reported to bind to EGFR, and that it may also mediate the formation of PTEN/EGFR complex to regulate EGFR/AKT signaling. In this study, experiments were performed to verify the hypothesis. Results showed that PTEN co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR, demonstrating PTEN/EGFR complex can form in tissue. Further studies showed that EBP50 knockdown decreased the amount of PTEN/EGFR complex by GST pull-down assay, and EBP50 overexpression increased the amount of PTEN/EGFR complex in a dose-dependent manner. While PTEN mutant (V403A), which can not bind with EBP50, only slightly mediated the formation of PTEN/EGFR complex, confirming that EBP50 specifically mediated the formation of the PTEN/EGFR complex. Both PTEN (V403A) and EGFR (L1043/1063F) mutants can not bind with EBP50. The expression of PTEN (V403A) or EGFR (L1043/1063F) mutant in cells resulted in higher AKT activation level than their respective wild-types by EGF stimulation, indicating that EBP50-mediated PTEN/EGFR complex can effectively inhibit EGF-induced AKT activation. EGF stimulation of siEBP50 cells induced higher AKT activation level compared with control cells, further confirming EBP50-mediated PTEN/EGFR complex can more effectively inhibit EGF-induced AKT activation. These results demonstrated the PTEN/EGFR complex formed under the mediation of EBP50, revealing a novel mechanism for negative regulation of EGF-induced AKT pathway, which may be an important molecular target for antineoplastic therapy.

8084002|t|Functional importance of complex formation between the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor family and adenovirus E1A proteins as determined by mutational analysis of E1A conserved region 2.
8084002|t|Adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) products induce DNA synthesis, transform primary rodent cells, and activate transcription factor E2F through complex formation with an array of cellular proteins via the E1A amino terminus and conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2). Interactions with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, pRb, and related proteins p107 and p130 rely somewhat on CR1 but largely on CR2, which contains a core binding sequence Leu-122-X-Cys-X-Glu. We introduced point mutations in CR2 to define such interactions more precisely. In human cells, alteration of any of the conserved residues within the binding core eliminated complex formation with pRb. Conversion of nonconserved Thr-123 to Pro (but not to either Ala or Ser) disrupted binding of pRb, presumably because of conformational changes in the binding core. No single E1A point mutant was completely defective in binding p107, suggesting that molecular interactions between E1A proteins and p107 clearly differ from those with pRb and p130. In general, the patterns of complex formation by E1A mutants in rat, monkey, and human cells were quite similar. All mutants which failed to bind significant amounts of pRb also failed to transform primary rat cells. Several mutants demonstrated selective binding to pRb, p107, and p130, but transforming activity corresponded largely with complex formation with pRb, regardless of the levels of interactions with p107 and p130. Mutants defective for binding of both pRb and p107 failed to induce the activity of transcription factor E2F; however, quite high levels were activated by E1A mutants that interacted with p107 alone. These results suggested that both pRb and p107 are important regulators of E2F activity but that complex formation with and activation of E2F by p107 are insufficient for cell transformation.

14706290|t|The calmodulin binding region of the skeletal ryanodine receptor acts as a self-modulatory domain.
14706290|t|A synthetic peptide (CaMBP) matching amino acids 3614-3643 of the skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) binds to both Ca2+-free calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+-bound CaM with nanomolar affinity [J. Biol. Chem. 276 (2001) 2069]. We report here that CaMBP increases [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 in a dose- and Ca2+-dependent manner; it also induces Ca2+ release from SR vesicles, and increases open probability (P(o)) of single RyR channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers. Further, CaMBP removes CaM associated with SR vesicles and increases [3H]ryanodine binding to purified RyR1, suggesting that its mechanism of action is two-fold: it removes endogenous inhibitors and also interacts directly with complementary regions in RyR1. Remarkably, the N-terminus of CaMBP activates RyRs while the C-terminus of CaMBP inhibits RyR activity, suggesting the presence of two discrete functional subdomains within this region. A ryr1 mutant lacking this region, RyR1-Delta3614-3643, was constructed and expressed in dyspedic myoblasts (RyR1-knockout). The depolarization-, caffeine- and 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC)-induced Ca2+ transients in these cells were dramatically reduced compared with cells expressing wild type RyR1. Deletion of the 3614-3643 region also resulted in profound changes in unitary conductance and channel gating. We thus propose that the RyR1 3614-3643 region acts not only as the CaM binding site, but also as an important modulatory domain for RyR1 function.

22754302|t|Role of 14-3-3ζ in platelet glycoprotein Ibα-von Willebrand factor interaction-induced signaling.
22754302|t|The interaction of platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX with von Willebrand factor (VWF) exposed at the injured vessel wall or atherosclerotic plaque rupture initiates platelet transient adhesion to the injured vessel wall, which triggers intracellular signaling cascades leading to platelet activation and thrombus formation. 14-3-3ζ has been verified to regulate the VWF binding function of GPIb-IX by interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of GPIb-IX. However, the data regarding the role of 14-3-3ζ in GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced signaling still remain controversial. In the present study, the data indicate that the S609A mutation replacing Ser(609) of GPIbα with alanine (S609A) significantly prevented the association of 14-3-3ζ with GPIbα before and after the VWF binding to GPIbα. GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced activations of Src family kinases and protein kinase C were clearly reduced in S609A mutation. Furthermore, S609A mutation significantly inhibited GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced elevation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels in flow cytometry analysis. Taken together, these data indicate that the association of 14-3-3ζ with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα plays an important role in GPIb-IX-VWF interaction-induced signaling.

15358376|t|Over-expression of the human MDM2 p53 binding domain by fusion to a p53 transactivation peptide.
15358376|t|MDM2 binds to the tumor suppressor protein p53 and regulates the level of p53 in cells. Although it is possible to prepare a small amount of the region of MDM2 that binds to p53, the expression level of this fragment of MDM2 is relatively low, limiting the studies involving this protein. Here, we describe a construct for the optimized bacterial expression and purification of the MDM2 p53 binding domain. We found that the expression level of the soluble MDM2 p53 binding domain in bacteria was increased dramatically by fusing it to its interaction partner, the p53 transactivation peptide. Attachment of the p53 transactivation peptide (residues 17-29) to the N-terminus of MDM2 resulted in a more than 200-fold increase of soluble protein expression of the p53 binding domain in bacteria. To obtain the final MDM2 p53 binding domain (residues 5-109) we inserted a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site between the P53 peptide and the MDM2 p53 binding domain. To weaken the protein/peptide interaction and facilitate the separation of the protein from the complex, we introduced a point mutation of one of the key interaction residues (F19A or W23A) in the p53 peptide. The advantages of our new construct are high yield and easy purification of the MDM2 protein.

14500659|t|Receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand stimulates recruitment of SHP-1 to the complex containing TNFR-associated factor 6 that regulates osteoclastogenesis.
14500659|t|Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is essential for differentiation and function of osteoclasts. The negative signaling pathways downstream of RANKL are not well characterized. By retroviral transduction of RAW264.7 cells with a dominant negative Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1)(C453S), we studied the role of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Over-expression of SHP-1(C453S) significantly enhanced the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear osteoclast-like cells in response to RANKL in a dose-dependent manner. RANKL induced the recruitment of SHP-1 to a complex containing TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)6. GST pull down experiments indicated that the association of SHP-1 with TRAF6 is mediated by SHP-1 lacking the two Src homology 2 domains. RANKL-stimulated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation and DNA binding ability of NF-kappaB were increased after over-expression of SHP-1(C453S). However, RANKL-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, was unchanged. In addition, SHP-1 regulated RANKL-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and the phosphorylation of Akt. Increased numbers of osteoclasts contribute to severe osteopenia in Me(v)/Me(v) mice due to mutation of SHP-1. Like RAW264.7 cells expressing SHP-1(C453S), the bone marrow macrophages of Me(v)/Me(v) mice generated much more osteoclast-like cells than that of littermate controls in response to RANKL. Furthermore compared with controls, RANKL induces enhanced association of TRAF6 and RANK in both RAW264.7 cells expressing SHP-1(C453S) and bone marrow macrophages from Me(v)/Me(v) mice. Therefore, SHP-1 plays a role in signals downstream of RANKL by recruitment to the complex containing TRAF6 and these observations may help to understand the mechanism of osteoporosis in Me(v)/Me(v) mice.

11306463|t|A cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 binding site within the C domain of the retinoblastoma protein.
11306463|t|Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by the cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4 complex (cdk4/D1) is a key regulatory step for maintaining the orderly progression of the cell cycle. The B domain of Rb contains a site that recognizes and binds the LXCXE motif found in D-type cyclins. This interaction is important for phosphorylation of Rb by cdk4/D1, although in vitro the Rb C domain alone is efficiently phosphorylated by cdk4/D1. A mutation in the C domain of Rb, L901Q, has been identified that completely abolishes cdk4/D1 phosphorylation of the isolated C domain. By contrast, the L901Q mutation has no effect on phosphorylation by either cyclin E/cdk2 or cyclin B/cdk1, suggesting that the interaction between L901Q and cdk4/D1 is specific. Introduction of the L901Q mutation into Rb containing the A, B, and C domains results in phosphorylation becoming predominantly dependent on the LXCXE binding region. However, when the LXCXE binding region of Rb is mutated, phosphorylation becomes dependent on the L901 site within the C domain. The L901 binding site can supplant the LXCXE binding site for the cdk4/D1-dependent phosphorylation of S780 and S795 but not S807/S811. Despite the limited homology between C domains of Rb, p107, and p130, the L901 site is conserved and introduction of the L925Q mutation into the isolated C domain of p107 also inhibits phosphorylation by cdk4/D1. These data support a model for cdk4/D1 recognizing two independent binding sites in Rb and suggests a conservation of this C domain binding motif for cyclin D1/cdk4 kinase among the Rb family of proteins.

11463845|t|Akt-dependent phosphorylation of p21(Cip1) regulates PCNA binding and proliferation of endothelial cells.
11463845|t|The protein kinase Akt is activated by growth factors and promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates the cell cycle inhibitory protein p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 in vitro and in intact cells as shown by in vitro kinase assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and phospho-peptide analysis. Akt-dependent phosphorylation of p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 prevents the complex formation of p21(Cip1) with PCNA, which inhibits DNA replication. In addition, phosphorylation of p21(Cip1) at Thr 145 decreases the binding of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4 to p21(Cip1) and attenuates the Cdk2 inhibitory activity of p21(Cip1). Immunohistochemistry and biochemical fractionation reveal that the decrease of PCNA binding and regulation of Cdk activity by p21(Cip1) phosphorylation is not caused by altered intracellular localization of p21(Cip1). As a functional consequence, phospho-mimetic mutagenesis of Thr 145 reverses the cell cycle-inhibitory properties of p21(Cip1), whereas the nonphosphorylatable p21(Cip1) T145A construct arrests cells in G(0) phase. These data suggest that the modulation of p21(Cip1) cell cycle functions by Akt-mediated phosphorylation regulates endothelial cell proliferation in response to stimuli that activate Akt.

19568783|t|The tumor suppressor p53 has evolved a MDM2-dependent feedback loop that promotes p53 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. MDM2 is an E3-RING containing ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes p53 ubiquitination by a dual-site mechanism requiring ligand occupation of its N-terminal hydrophobic pocket, which then stabilizes MDM2 binding to the ubiquitination signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53. A unique pseudo-substrate motif or "lid" in MDM2 is adjacent to its N-terminal hydrophobic pocket, and we have evaluated the effects of the flexible lid on the dual-site ubiquitination reaction mechanism catalyzed by MDM2. Deletion of this pseudo-substrate motif promotes MDM2 protein thermoinstability, indicating that the site can function as a positive regulatory element. Phospho-mimetic mutation in the pseudo-substrate motif at codon 17 (MDM2(S17D)) stabilizes the binding of MDM2 towards two distinct peptide docking sites within the p53 tetramer and enhances p53 ubiquitination. Molecular modeling orientates the phospho-mimetic pseudo-substrate motif in equilibrium over a charged surface patch on the MDM2 at Arg(97)/Lys(98), and mutation of these residues to the MDM4 equivalent reverses the activating effect of the phospho-mimetic mutation on MDM2 function. These data highlight the ability of the pseudo-substrate motif to regulate the allosteric interaction between the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and its central acidic domain, which stimulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2. This model of MDM2 regulation implicates an as yet undefined lid-kinase as a component of pro-oncogenic pathways that stimulate the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2 in cells.

25691752|t|iASPP, a previously unidentified regulator of desmosomes, prevents arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)-induced sudden death.
25691752|t|Desmosomes are anchoring junctions that exist in cells that endure physical stress such as cardiac myocytes. The importance of desmosomes in maintaining the homeostasis of the myocardium is underscored by frequent mutations of desmosome components found in human patients and animal models. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a phenotype caused by mutations in desmosomal components in ∼ 50% of patients, however, the causes in the remaining 50% of patients still remain unknown. A deficiency of inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP), an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of p53, caused by spontaneous mutation recently has been associated with a lethal autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy in Poll Hereford calves and Wa3 mice. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this putative function of iASPP are completely unknown. Here, we show that iASPP is expressed at intercalated discs in human and mouse postmitotic cardiomyocytes. iASPP interacts with desmoplakin and desmin in cardiomyocytes to maintain the integrity of desmosomes and intermediate filament networks in vitro and in vivo. iASPP deficiency specifically induces right ventricular dilatation in mouse embryos at embryonic day 16.5. iASPP-deficient mice with exon 8 deletion (Ppp1r13l(Δ8/Δ8)) die of sudden cardiac death, displaying features of ARVC. Intercalated discs in cardiomyocytes from four of six human ARVC cases show reduced or loss of iASPP. ARVC-derived desmoplakin mutants DSP-1-V30M and DSP-1-S299R exhibit weaker binding to iASPP. These data demonstrate that by interacting with desmoplakin and desmin, iASPP is an important regulator of desmosomal function both in vitro and in vivo. This newly identified property of iASPP may provide new molecular insight into the pathogenesis of ARVC.

12415268|t|Disruption of oxygen homeostasis underlies congenital Chuvash polycythemia.
12415268|t|Chuvash polycythemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that is endemic to the mid-Volga River region. We previously mapped the locus associated with Chuvash polycythemia to chromosome 3p25. The gene associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, VHL, maps to this region, and homozygosity with respect to a C-->T missense mutation in VHL, causing an arginine-to-tryptophan change at amino-acid residue 200 (Arg200Trp), was identified in all individuals affected with Chuvash polycythemia. The protein VHL modulates the ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, subunit alpha (HIF1alpha). Our data indicate that the Arg200Trp substitution impairs the interaction of VHL with HIF1alpha, reducing the rate of degradation of HIF1alpha and resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes including EPO (encoding erythropoietin), SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1, encoding solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1), TF (encoding transferrin), TFRC (encoding transferrin receptor (p90, CD71)) and VEGF (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor).

16472755|t|Crystal structure of the human retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein and its interaction with Arl3.
16472755|t|The crystal structure of human retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein (RP2) was solved to 2.1 angstroms resolution. It consists of an N-terminal beta helix and a C-terminal ferredoxin-like alpha/beta domain. RP2 is functionally and structurally related to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. Seven of nine known RP2 missense mutations identified in patients are located in the beta helix domain, and most of them cluster to the hydrophobic core and are likely to destabilize the protein. Two residues, Glu138 and the catalytically important Arg118, are solvent-exposed and form a salt bridge, indicating that Glu138 might be critical for positioning Arg118 for catalysis. RP2 is a specific effector protein of Arl3. The N-terminal 34 residues and beta helix domain of RP2 are required for this interaction. The abilitities of RP2 to bind Arl3 and cause retinitis pigmentosa seem to be correlated, since both the R118H and E138G mutants show a drastically reduced affinity to Arl3.

14736710|t|Regulation of the human NBC3 Na+/HCO3- cotransporter by carbonic anhydrase II and PKA.
14736710|t|Human NBC3 is an electroneutral Na(+)/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney in which it plays an important role in HCO(3)(-) metabolism. Cytosolic enzyme carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) catalyzes the reaction CO(2) + H(2)O left arrow over right arrow HCO(3)(-) + H(+) in many tissues. We investigated whether NBC3, like some Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange proteins, could bind CAII and whether PKA could regulate NBC3 activity through modulation of CAII binding. CAII bound the COOH-terminal domain of NBC3 (NBC3Ct) with K(d) = 101 nM; the interaction was stronger at acid pH. Cotransfection of HEK-293 cells with NBC3 and CAII recruited CAII to the plasma membrane. Mutagenesis of consensus CAII binding sites revealed that the D1135-D1136 region of NBC3 is essential for CAII/NBC3 interaction and for optimal function, because the NBC3 D1135N/D1136N retained only 29 +/- 22% of wild-type activity. Coexpression of the functionally dominant-negative CAII mutant V143Y with NBC3 or addition of 100 microM 8-bromoadenosine to NBC3 transfected cells reduced intracellular pH (pH(i)) recovery rate by 31 +/- 3, or 38 +/- 7%, respectively, relative to untreated NBC3 transfected cells. The effects were additive, together decreasing the pH(i) recovery rate by 69 +/- 12%, suggesting that PKA reduces transport activity by a mechanism independently of CAII. Measurements of PKA-dependent phosphorylation by mass spectroscopy and labeling with [gamma-(32)P]ATP showed that NBC3Ct was not a PKA substrate. These results demonstrate that NBC3 and CAII interact to maximize the HCO(3)(-) transport rate. Although PKA decreased NBC3 transport activity, it did so independently of the NBC3/CAII interaction and did not involve phosphorylation of NBC3Ct.

16873377|t|The scaffolding adapter Gab2, via Shp-2, regulates kit-evoked mast cell proliferation by activating the Rac/JNK pathway.
16873377|t|The scaffolding adapter Gab2 mediates cell signaling and responses evoked by various extracellular stimuli including several growth factors. Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including mast cells. Kit, via Tyr(567) and Tyr(719), activates Src family kinases (SFK) and PI3K respectively, which converge on the activation of a Rac/JNK pathway required for mast cell proliferation. However, how Kit Tyr(567) signals to Rac/JNK is not well understood. By analyzing Gab2(-/-) mast cells, we find that Gab2 is required for SCF-evoked proliferation, activation of Rac/JNK, and Ras. Upon Kit activation in wild-type mast cells, Gab2 becomes tyrosyl-phosphorylated and associates with Kit and Shp-2. Tyr(567), an SFK binding site in Kit, and SFK activity were required for Gab2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and association with Shp-2. By re-expressing Gab2 or a Gab2 mutant that cannot bind Shp-2 in Gab2(-/-) mast cells or acutely by deleting Shp-2 in mast cells, we found that Gab2 requires Shp-2 for SCF-evoked Rac/JNK, Ras activation, and mast cell proliferation. Lastly, by analyzing mast cells from mice with compound Gab2 and Kit Y719F mutations (i.e., Gab2(-/-): KitY719F/Y719F mice), we find that Gab2, acting in a parallel pathway to PI3K from Kit Tyr(719), regulates mast cell proliferation and development in specific tissues. Our data show that Gab2 via Shp-2 is critical for transmitting signals from Kit Tyr(567) to activate the Rac/JNK pathway controlling mast cell proliferation, which likely contributes to mast cell development in specific tissues.

12477814|t|Heterodimerization of the two major envelope proteins is essential for arterivirus infectivity.
12477814|t|The two major envelope proteins of arteriviruses, the membrane protein (M) and the major glycoprotein (GP(5)), associate into a disulfide-linked heterodimer that is incorporated into the virion and has been assumed to be a prerequisite for virus assembly. Using an equine arteritis virus (EAV) infectious cDNA clone, we have analyzed the requirement for GP(5)-M heterodimerization and have identified the Cys residues involved in the formation of the GP(5)-M disulfide bond. The single Cys residue (Cys-8) in the M ectodomain was crucial for heterodimerization and virus infectivity. Mutagenesis of any of the five Cys residues in the GP(5) ectodomain or removal of the single GP(5) N-glycosylation site also rendered the full-length clone noninfectious. However, an analysis of revertants yielded an exceptional pseudorevertant in which residues 52 to 79 of the GP(5) ectodomain had been deleted and the original Cys-80-->Ser mutation had been maintained. Consequently, this revertant lacked the GP(5) N-glycosyation site (Asn-56) and retained only a single cysteine residue (Cys-34). By using this GP(5) deletion, we confirmed that Cys-34 of GP(5) and Cys-8 of M are essential for GP(5)-M heterodimerization, a key event in the assembly of the EAV envelope.

27092946|t|Investigating CFTR and KCa3.1 Protein/Protein Interactions.
27092946|t|In epithelia, Cl- channels play a prominent role in fluid and electrolyte transport. Of particular importance is the cAMP-dependent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channel (CFTR) with mutations of the CFTR encoding gene causing cystic fibrosis. The bulk transepithelial transport of Cl- ions and electrolytes needs however to be coupled to an increase in K+ conductance in order to recycle K+ and maintain an electrical driving force for anion exit across the apical membrane. In several epithelia, this K+ efflux is ensured by K+ channels, including KCa3.1, which is expressed at both the apical and basolateral membranes. We show here for the first time that CFTR and KCa3.1 can physically interact. We first performed a two-hybrid screen to identify which KCa3.1 cytosolic domains might mediate an interaction with CFTR. Our results showed that both the N-terminal fragment M1-M40 of KCa3.1 and part of the KCa3.1 calmodulin binding domain (residues L345-A400) interact with the NBD2 segment (G1237-Y1420) and C- region of CFTR (residues T1387-L1480), respectively. An association of CFTR and F508del-CFTR with KCa3.1 was further confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating the formation of immunoprecipitable CFTR/KCa3.1 complexes in CFBE cells. Co-expression of KCa3.1 and CFTR in HEK cells did not impact CFTR expression at the cell surface, and KCa3.1 trafficking appeared independent of CFTR stimulation. Finally, evidence is presented through cross-correlation spectroscopy measurements that KCa3.1 and CFTR colocalize at the plasma membrane and that KCa3.1 channels tend to aggregate consequent to an enhanced interaction with CFTR channels at the plasma membrane following an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Altogether, these results suggest 1) that the physical interaction KCa3.1/CFTR can occur early during the biogenesis of both proteins and 2) that KCa3.1 and CFTR form a dynamic complex, the formation of which depends on internal Ca2+.

16055726|t|Glycogen synthase kinase 3-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 regulates p53 abundance.
16055726|t|The Mdm2 oncoprotein regulates abundance and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. For efficient degradation of p53, Mdm2 needs to be phosphorylated at several contiguous residues within the central conserved domain. We show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) phosphorylated the Mdm2 protein in vitro and in vivo in the central domain. Inhibition of GSK-3 rescued p53 from degradation in an Mdm2-dependent manner while its association with Mdm2 was not affected. Likewise, inhibition of GSK-3 did not alter localization of p53 and Mdm2 or the interaction of Mdm2 and MdmX. Ionizing radiation, which leads to p53 accumulation, directed phosphorylation of GSK-3 at serine 9, which preceded and overlapped with the increase in p53 levels. Moreover, expression of a GSK-3 mutant where serine 9 was replaced with an alanine reduced the accumulation of p53 and induction of its target p21(WAF-1). We therefore conclude that inhibition of GSK-3 contributes to hypophosphorylation of Mdm2 in response to ionizing rays, and in consequence to p53 stabilization.

19293155|t|Oxidizable residues mediating protein stability and cytoprotective interaction of DJ-1 with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1.
19293155|t|Parkinson disease (PD)-associated genomic deletions and the destabilizing L166P point mutation lead to loss of the cytoprotective DJ-1 protein. The effects of other PD-associated point mutations are less clear. Here we demonstrate that the M26I mutation reduces DJ-1 expression, particularly in a null background (knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Thus, homozygous M26I mutation causes loss of DJ-1 protein. To determine the cellular consequences, we measured suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and cytotoxicity for [M26I]DJ-1, and systematically all other DJ-1 methionine and cysteine mutants. C106A mutation of the central redox site specifically abolished binding to ASK1 and the cytoprotective activity of DJ-1. DJ-1 was apparently recruited into the ASK1 signalosome via Cys-106-linked mixed disulfides. The designed higher order oxidation mimicking [C106DD]DJ-1 non-covalently bound to ASK1 even in the absence of hydrogen peroxide and conferred partial cytoprotection. Interestingly, mutations of peripheral redox sites (C46A and C53A) and M26I also led to constitutive ASK1 binding. Cytoprotective [wt]DJ-1 bound to the ASK1 N terminus (which is known to bind another negative regulator, thioredoxin 1), whereas [M26I]DJ-1 bound to aberrant C-terminal site(s). Consequently, the peripheral cysteine mutants retained cytoprotective activity, whereas the PD-associated mutant [M26I]DJ-1 failed to suppress ASK1 activity and nuclear export of the death domain-associated protein Daxx and did not promote cytoprotection. Thus, cytoprotective binding of DJ-1 to ASK1 depends on the central redox-sensitive Cys-106 and may be modulated by peripheral cysteine residues. We suggest that impairments in oxidative conformation changes of DJ-1 might contribute to PD neurodegeneration.

8947469|t|Association between phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Cbl and other tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in colony-stimulating factor-1-stimulated macrophages.
8947469|t|Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) stimulation of the macrophage cell line BAC1.2F5 and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) p85 alpha and its stable association with several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including CSF-1 receptor (p165), p120, p95 and p55-p60. p120 co-migrated with the product of the protooncogene c-cb1 in anti-p85 alpha immunoprecipitates, and associated with p85 alpha in a rapid and transient manner. Reciprocal experiments confirmed the presence of p85 alpha in anti-Cb1 immunoprecipitates on CSF-1 stimulation of macrophages. PI-3 kinase immunoprecipitates from the myeloid FDC-P1 cell line expressing mutant CSF-1 receptor (Y721F), which does not associate with PI-3 kinase, still contained Cbl. The identity of the tyrosine phosphorylated protein p95 remains unknown. The interaction between p85 alpha and the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins survived anion-exchange chromatography, suggesting perhaps the presence of a stable complex; furthermore, in CSF-1-treated BAC1.2F5 cell extracts, only one of the two pools of PI-3 kinase separated by chromatography was present in this putative complex. The association did not appear to correlate with proliferation, since a similar interaction between p85 alpha and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was also observed in poorly proliferating resident peritoneal macrophages stimulated with CSF-1. The possible significance of these findings for CSF-1-regulated macrophage functions is discussed.

11171059|t|Phosphorylation of elongation factor-2 kinase on serine 499 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase induces Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity.
11171059|t|Elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K) negatively regulates mRNA translation via the phosphorylation and inactivation of elongation factor-2 (eEF-2). We have shown previously that purified eEF-2K can be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and that this induces significant Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-independent eEF-2K activity [Redpath and Proud (1993) Biochem. J. 293, 31-34]. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP levels in adipocytes also increases the level of Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity to a similar extent, providing a mechanistic link between elevated cAMP and the inhibition of protein synthesis [Diggle, Redpath, Heesom and Denton (1998) Biochem. J. 336, 525-529]. Here we describe the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-eEF-2K fusion protein and the identification of two serine residues that are phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Endoproteinase Arg-C digestion of GST-eEF-2K produced two phosphopeptides that were separated by HPLC and sequenced. (32)P Radioactivity release from these peptides indicated that the sites of phosphorylation were Ser-365 and Ser-499, both of which lie C-terminal to the catalytic domain. Mutation of these sites to non-phosphorylatable residues indicated that both sites need to be phosphorylated to induce Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in vitro. However, expression of Myc-tagged eEF-2K in HEK 293 cells, followed by treatment with chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), showed that Ser-499 phosphorylation alone induced Ca(2+)/CaM-independent eEF-2K activity in cells. Co-expression of wild-type eEF-2K with luciferase resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in luciferase expression. Expression of eEF-2K S499D resulted in a 10-fold reduction in luciferase expression despite the fact that this mutant was expressed at very low levels. This indicates that eEF-2K S499D is constitutively active when expressed in cells, thus leading to the suppression of its own expression. Our data demonstrate an important role for the phosphorylation of Ser-499 in the activation of eEF-2K by PKA and the inhibition of protein synthesis.

9226170|t|Expression and functional characterization of an abnormal platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib alpha (Met239 --> Val) reported in patients with platelet-type von Willebrand disease.
9226170|t|Platelet-type von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by heightened ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation caused by abnormally high affinity between the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Two distinct point mutations, Gly233 to Val and Met239 to Val, have been reported in GPIb alpha. We have constructed a recombinant GPIb alpha fragment containing the latter mutation, Met239 to Val (M239V) and characterized the mutant molecule using two methods, ie, interaction between soluble vWF and immobilized M239V and inhibition of platelet aggregation by purified soluble M239V. Spontaneous binding (ie, binding without any inducers) was observed between 125I-vWF and immobilized M239V but not between 125I-vWF and immobilized wild-type (WT) GPIb alpha. The addition of low concentrations of ristocetin (0.2 mg/mL) induced specific 125I-vWF binding to immobilized M239V, but not to WT GPIb alpha. At high concentrations of ristocetin (1.2 mg/mL), both WT GPIb alpha and M239V specifically bound to 125I-vWF. Thus, M239V reproduced the unique functional abnormality of the GPIb/IX complex in platelet-type vWD. Moreover, the purified soluble M239V inhibited platelet aggregation induced by low concentration of ristocetin (0.3 mg/mL) in platelet-rich plasma from a patient having Met239 to Val mutation, whereas purified WT did not. These results provide direct evidences that the reported point mutation is the responsible molecular basis of this disorder.

9677338|t|ErbB3 (HER3) interaction with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
9677338|t|ErbB3 (HER3), a unique member of the ErbB receptor family, lacks intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and contains six Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met (YXXM) consensus binding sites for the SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. ErbB3 also has a proline-rich sequence that forms a consensus binding site for the SH3 domain of p85. Here we have investigated the interacting domains of ErbB3 and p85 by a unique application of the yeast two-hybrid system. A chimaeric ErbB3 molecule containing the epidermal growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase domain was developed so that the C-terminal domain of ErbB3 could become phosphorylated in the yeast system. We also generated several ErbB3 deletion and Tyr-->Phe site-specific mutants, and observed that a single ErbB3 YXXM motif was necessary and sufficient for the association of ErbB3 with p85. The incorporation of multiple YXXM motifs into the ErbB3 C-terminus enabled a stronger ErbB3/p85 interaction. The proline-rich region of ErbB3 was not necessary for interaction with p85. However, either deletion or mutation of the p85 SH3 domain decreased the observed ErbB3/p85 association. Additionally an ErbB3/p85 SH3 domain interaction was detected by an assay in vitro. These results were consistent with a model in which pairs of phosphorylated ErbB3 YXXM motifs co-operate in binding to the tandem SH2 domains of p85. Although a contributing role for the p85 SH3 domain was suggested, the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains seemed to be primarily responsible for the high-affinity association of p85 and ErbB3.

15700267|t|C-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII regulates the assembly and function of the DOCK180/ELMO Rac-GEF.
15700267|t|Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans identified an evolutionarily conserved CED-2 (CrkII), CED-5 (DOCK180), CED-12 (ELMO), CED-10 (Rac1) module important for cell migration and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Previous studies have shown that DOCK180 and ELMO comprise an unconventional bipartite Dbl homology domain-independent Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rac-GEF); but it is still unclear how CrkII functions in Rac-GEF activity. In this study, we have characterized a unique function of CrkII in phagocytosis and Rac activation mediated by the C-terminal SH3 domain, a region of CrkII that has no clear cellular or biochemical function. We found that mutations that disrupt the C-terminal SH3 domain of CrkII (CrkII-SH3-C) abrogate engulfment of apoptotic cells and impair cell spreading on extracellular matrix. Surprisingly, despite the effects on engulfment, W276K CrkII strongly potentiated Rac-GTP loading when ectopically expressed in HEK 293T cells. Contrary to the effects of the true dominant negative SH2 domain mutants (R38K CrkII) and SH3-N domain mutants (W170K CrkII) that prevent macromolecular assembly of signaling proteins, W276K CrkII increases association between DOCK180 and CrkII as well as constitutive tethering of the Crk/DOCK180/ELMO protein complex that interacted with RhoG. Our results indicate that while N-terminal SH3 of CrkII promotes assembly between CrkII and DOCK180, the C-terminal SH3 of CrkII regulates the stability and turnover of the DOCK180/ELMO complex. Studies with W276K CrkII may offer a unique opportunity to study the structure and function of the DOCK180/ELMO Rac-GEF.

14512419|t|The interacting binding domains of the beta(4) integrin and calcium-activated chloride channels (CLCAs) in metastasis.
14512419|t|CLCA (chloride channel, calcium-activated) proteins are novel pulmonary vascular addresses for blood-borne, lung-metastatic cancer cells. They facilitate vascular arrest of cancer cells via adhesion to beta4 integrin and promote early, intravascular, metastatic growth. Here we identify the interacting binding domains of endothelial CLCA proteins (e.g. hCLCA2, mCLCA5, mCLCA1, and bCLCA2) and beta4 integrin. Endothelial CLCAs share a common beta4-binding motif (beta4BM) in their 90- and 35-kDa subunits of the sequence F(S/N)R(I/L/V)(S/T)S, which is located in the second extracellular domain of the 90-kDa CLCA and near the N terminus of the 35-kDa CLCA, respectively. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays, we showed that glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of beta4BMs from the 90- and 35-kDa CLCA subunits bind to the beta4 integrin in a metal ion-dependent manner. Fusion proteins from fibronectin and the integrins beta1 and beta3 served as negative controls. beta4BM fusion proteins competitively blocked the beta4/CLCA adhesion and prevented lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A disrupted beta4BM in hCLCA1, which is not expressed in endothelia, failed to interact with beta4 integrin. The corresponding CLCA-binding domain of the beta4 integrin is localized to the specific determining loop (SDL). Again enzyme-linked immunosorbent, pull-down, and adhesion assays were used to confirm the interaction with CLCA proteins using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein representing the C-terminal two-thirds of beta4 SDL (amino acids 184-203). A chimeric beta4 integrin in which the indicated SDL sequence had been replaced with the corresponding sequence from the beta1 integrin failed to bind hCLCA2. The dominance of the CLCA ligand in beta4 activation and outside-in signaling is discussed in reference to our previous report that beta4/CLCA ligation elicits selective signaling via focal adhesion kinase to promote metastatic growth.

10419452|t|Modulation of rap activity by direct interaction of Galpha(o) with Rap1 GTPase-activating protein.
10419452|t|We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact directly with Galpha(o). Mutant-activated Galpha(o) was used as the bait to screen a cDNA library from chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. We found that Galpha(o) interacted with several proteins including Gz-GTPase-activating protein (Gz-GAP), a new RGS protein (RGS-17), a novel protein of unknown function (IP6), and Rap1GAP. This study focuses on Rap1GAP, which selectively interacts with Galpha(o) and Galpha(i) but not with Galpha(s) or Galpha(q). Rap1GAP interacts more avidly with the unactivated Galpha(o) as compared with the mutant (Q205L)-activated Galpha(o). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, unactivated Galpha(o) co-immunoprecipitates with the Rap1GAP. Expression of chick Rap1GAP in PC-12 cells inhibited activation of Rap1 by forskolin. When unactivated Galpha(o) was expressed, the amount of activated Rap1 was greatly increased. This effect was not observed with the Q205L-Galpha(o). Expression of unactivated Galpha(o) stimulated MAP-kinase (MAPK1/2) activity in a Rap1GAP-dependent manner. These results identify a novel function of Galpha(o), which in its resting state can sequester Rap1GAP thereby regulating Rap1 activity and consequently gating signal flow from Rap1 to MAPK1/2. Thus, activation of G(o) could modulate the Rap1 effects on a variety of cellular functions.

18996087|t|S1219 residue of 53BP1 is phosphorylated by ATM kinase upon DNA damage and required for proper execution of DNA damage response.
18996087|t|53BP1 is phosphorylated by the protein kinase ATM upon DNA damage. Even though several ATM phosphorylation sites in 53BP1 have been reported, those sites have little functional implications in the DNA damage response. Here, we show that ATM phosphorylates the S1219 residue of 53BP1 in vitro and that the residue is phosphorylated in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). Transfection with siRNA targeting ATM abolished IR-induced phosphorylation at this residue, supporting the theory that this process is mediated by the kinase. To determine the functional relevance of this phosphorylation event, a U2OS cell line expressing S1219A mutant 53BP1 was established. IR-induced foci formation of MDC1 and gammaH2AX, DNA damage signaling molecules, was reduced in this cell line, implying that S1219 phosphorylation is required for recruitment of these molecules to DNA damage sites. Furthermore, overexpression of the mutant protein impeded IR-induced G2 arrest. In conclusion, we have shown that S1219 phosphorylation by ATM is required for proper execution of DNA damage response.

16038803|t|Grb2 negatively regulates epidermal growth factor-induced phospholipase C-gamma1 activity through the direct interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated phospholipase C-gamma1.
16038803|t|Phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) plays pivotal roles in cellular growth and proliferation. Upon the stimulation of growth factors and hormones, PLC-gamma1 is rapidly phosphorylated at three known sites; Tyr771, Tyr783 and Tyr1254 and its enzymatic activity is up-regulated. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Grb2, an adaptor protein, specifically interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma1 at Tyr783. The association of Grb2 with PLC-gamma1 was induced by the treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Replacement of Tyr783 with Phe completely blocked EGF-induced interaction of PLC-gamma1 with Grb2, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1 at Tyr783 is essential for the interaction with Grb2. Interestingly, the depletion of Grb2 from HEK-293 cells by RNA interference significantly enhanced increased EGF-induced PLC-gamma1 enzymatic activity and mobilization of the intracellular Ca2+, while it did not affect EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma1. Furthermore, overexpression of Grb2 inhibited PLC-gamma1 enzymatic activity. Taken together, these results suggest Grb2, in addition to its key function in signaling through Ras, may have a negatively regulatory role on EGF-induced PLC-gamma1 activation.

11237865|t|Roles of the forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR) phosphorylation sites in regulating 14-3-3 binding, transactivation and nuclear targetting.
11237865|t|The transcription factor, forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma (FKHR), is phosphorylated at three amino acid residues (Thr-24, Ser-256 and Ser-319) by protein kinase B (PKB)alpha. In the present study, mutagenesis has been used to study the roles of these phosphorylation events in regulating FKHR function in transfected HEK-293 cells. We find that the overexpression of FKHR[S256A] (where Ser-256-->Ala) blocks PKB activity in cells, preventing phosphorylation of the endogenous substrates FKHRL1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3. Thus some reported effects of overexpression of this and other mutants may be indirect, and result from suppression of the phosphorylation of other sites on FKHR and/or other PKB substrates. For example, we have shown that Thr-24 phosphorylation alone is critical for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, and that the substitution of Ser-256 with an alanine residue indirectly blocks 14-3-3 protein binding by preventing the phosphorylation of Thr-24. We also found that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and serum-induced nuclear exclusion of FKHR[S256A] depends on the degree of overexpression of this mutant. Our results indicated that the interaction of FKHR with 14-3-3 proteins was not required for IGF-1-stimulated exclusion of FKHR from the nucleus. We present evidence in support of another mechanism, which depends on the phosphorylation of Ser-256 and may involve the masking of a nuclear localization signal. Finally, we have demonstrated that the failure of IGF-1 to suppress transactivation by FKHR[S256A] is not explained entirely by its failure to bind 14-3-3 proteins or to undergo nuclear exclusion. This result suggests that Ser-256 phosphorylation may also suppress transactivation by FKHR by yet another mechanism, perhaps by disrupting the interaction of FKHR with target DNA binding sites and/or the function of the transactivation domain.

17724026|t|Protein kinase C zeta. A novel regulator of both phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of cardiac sarcomeric proteins.
17724026|t|Our experiments investigated associations of specific isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) with individual proteins in the cardiac troponin complex. Troponin I (cTnI) associated with PKCepsilon and zeta and troponin T (cTnT) associated with PKC alpha, delta, and epsilon. Based on its association with cTnI, we hypothesized that PKCzeta is a major regulator of myofilament protein phosphorylation. To test this, we infected adult cardiac myocytes with adenoviral constructs containing DsRed monomer-tagged wild type (WT) and the following constitutively active forms of PKCzeta: the pseudo-substrate region (A119E), 3'-phospho-inositide-dependent kinase-1 (T410E), and auto-phosphorylation (T560E). The A119E and T410E mutants displayed increased localization to the Z-discs compared with WT and T560E. Immunoprecipitations were performed in myocytes expressing PKCzeta using PKC phospho-motif antibodies to determine the phosphorylation of cTnI, cTnT, tropomyosin, myosin-binding protein C, and desmin. We did not find serine (Ser) phosphorylation of cTnI or cTnT. However, we observed a significant decrease in threonine (Thr) phosphorylation of cTnI and cTnT notably by PKCzeta T560E. Ser phosphorylation of tropomyosin was increased by all three active mutants of PKCzeta. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of myosin-binding protein C increased primarily by PKCzeta A119E. Both PKCzeta A119E and T410E mutants increased desmin Ser/Thr phosphorylation. To explain the apparent Thr dephosphorylation of cTnI and cTnT, we hypothesized that PKCzeta exists as a complex with p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and this was confirmed by immunoprecipitation Western blot. Our data demonstrate that PKCzeta is a novel regulator of myofilament protein phosphorylation.

12673016|t|Two regions responsible for the actin binding of p57, a mammalian coronin family actin-binding protein.
12673016|t|The actin-binding protein p57, a member of the coronin protein family, is expressed in a variety of immune cells. It has five WD repeats and a coiled-coil motif containing a leucine zipper, both of which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. In order to identify the precise actin-binding regions in p57, and to assess the contribution of these structural motifs, we prepared various truncated p57 as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and examined their actin-binding activity. A co-sedimentation assay demonstrated that p57(1-371) (C-terminal truncated p57) had the ability to bind F-actin, but p57(372-461) (a fragment containing the coiled-coil motif) did not. A segment consisting of the N-terminal 34 amino acids of p57 (p57(1-34)) was found to bind to F-actin in the co-sedimentation assay. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopic observation showed that p57(1-34) was co-localized with F-actin in COS-1 cells after the transfection with the p57(1-34) construct. Deletion of (10)KFRHVF(15), a sequence conserved among coronin-related proteins, from p57(1-34) abolished its actin-binding activity, suggesting that this sequence with basic and hydrophobic amino acids is crucial for p57 to bind to F-actin. However, the N-terminal deletion mutant p57(63-461) retained the binding ability to F-actin. This result suggests the presence of a second actin-binding region. Further deletion analysis revealed that p57(111-204), which includes the second and third WD repeats, also exhibited weak actin-binding activity in the co-sedimentation assay. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that at least two regions within Met-1 to Asp-34 and Ile-111 to Glu-204 of p57 are responsible for its binding to the actin cytoskeleton.

8940081|t|Grb7 is a downstream signaling component of platelet-derived growth factor alpha- and beta-receptors.
8940081|t|Ligand stimulation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha- or beta-receptors leads to activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinases and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Grb7 is an SH2 and PH domain-containing molecule that is known to be overexpressed in some breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Here we show that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly bind to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in vitro. Grb7 association to the PDGF beta-receptor was dramatically reduced by replacement of tyrosine residues 716 or 775 with phenylalanine residues. Synthetic phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 inhibited binding of the Grb7 SH2 domain to the autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptor in a manner similar to but distinct from the binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain. Grb7 associated with activated PDGF beta-receptors in vivo, and the association was dramatically reduced by substitution of Tyr-716 or Tyr-775 with a phenylalanine residue. Furthermore, complex formation between Shc and Grb7 was observed after ligand stimulation of PDGF alpha- or beta-receptors in cells transfected with Grb7 cDNA or in the breast cancer cell line BT-474. Thus, Grb7 is implicated in PDGF signaling pathways in certain cell types by binding to the receptor directly or indirectly via Shc.

20090955|t|The Parkinson's disease associated LRRK2 exhibits weaker in vitro phosphorylation of 4E-BP compared to autophosphorylation.
20090955|t|Mutations in the gene encoding Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein kinase containing a central catalytic core and a number of protein-protein interaction domains. An important step forward in the understanding of both the biology and the pathology of LRRK2 would be achieved by identification of its authentic physiological substrates. In the present study we examined phosphorylation of 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein), a recently proposed substrate for LRRKs. We found that LRRK2 is capable of phosphorylating 4E-BP in vitro. The PD related LRRK2-G2019S mutant was approximately 2 fold more active than wild type protein. However, LRRK2 autophosphorylation was stronger than 4E-BP phosphorylation under conditions of molar excess of 4E-BP to LRRK2. We also tested three other kinases (STK3, MAPK14/p38alpha and DAPK2) and found that MAPK14/p38alpha could efficiently phosphorylate 4E-BP at the same site as LRRK2 in vitro. Finally, we did not see changes in 4E-BP phosphorylation levels using inducible expression of LRRK2 in HEK cell lines. We also found that MAPK14/p38alpha phosphorylates 4E-BP in transient overexpression experiments whereas LRRK2 did not. We suggest that increased 4E-BP phosphorylation reported in some systems may be related to p38-mediated cell stress rather than direct LRRK2 activity. Overall, our results suggest that 4E-BP is a relatively poor direct substrate for LRRK2.

18667537|t|Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-elicited stimulation of gamma-secretase is mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent phosphorylation of presenilin and nicastrin.
18667537|t|Gamma-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), Aph-1, and Pen-2, and it catalyzes the final proteolytic step in the processing of amyloid precursor protein to generate amyloid-beta. Our previous results showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can potently stimulate gamma-secretase activity through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent pathway. Here, we demonstrate that TNF-alpha triggers JNK-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT to stimulate gamma-secretase activity. Blocking of JNK activity with a potent JNK inhibitor (SP600125) reduces TNF-alpha-triggered phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT. Consistent with this, we show that activated JNKs can be copurified with gamma-secretase complexes and that active recombinant JNK2 can promote the phosphorylation of PS1 and NCT in vitro. Using site-directed mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide, we clearly show that the Ser(319)Thr(320) motif in PS1 is an important JNK phosphorylation site that is critical for the TNF-alpha-elicited regulation of gamma-secretase. This JNK phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser(319)Thr(320) enhances the stability of the PS1 C-terminal fragment that is necessary for gamma-secretase activity. Together, our findings strongly suggest that JNK is a critical intracellular mediator of TNF-alpha-elicited regulation of gamma-secretase and governs the pivotal step in the assembly of functional gamma-secretase.

15116094|t|Disruption of 14-3-3 binding does not impair Protein 4.1B growth suppression.
15116094|t|Meningiomas are common central nervous system tumors; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis are largely unknown. Collaborative studies from our laboratory demonstrated a direct association of 14-3-3 with the meningioma tumor suppressor Protein 4.1B, which was not observed with other members of the Protein 4.1 family, including the NF2 meningioma tumor suppressor, merlin/schwannomin. Given the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, we sought to determine the functional significance of 14-3-3 binding to Protein 4.1B growth suppression. Based on comparative binding studies performed with additional members of the Protein 4.1 family, we generated specific missense mutations within the minimal growth suppressor fragment of Protein 4.1B (DAL-1, differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung). Complementary in vitro GST affinity chromatography and in vivo interaction experiments demonstrated that the F359Y mutation abrogated binding to 14-3-3, but did not impair DAL-1 binding to other known Protein 4.1B interacting proteins. Similar to wild-type DAL-1, the expression of the F359Y DAL-1 14-3-3-binding mutant resulted in reduced Protein 4.1B-deficient IOMM-Lee and CH157-MN meningioma cell line colony formation. Moreover, similar to wild-type DAL-1, the stable expression of the DAL-1 F359Y mutant significantly reduced cell proliferation in independently isolated IOMM-Lee clones, as assessed by thymidine incorporation. Collectively, these results suggest that binding to 14-3-3 is not essential for the growth suppressor function of Protein 4.1B in meningiomas.

16631117|t|Ubc9 interacts with SOX4 and represses its transcriptional activity.
16631117|t|SOX4 is a member of SOX transcriptional factor family that is crucial for many cellular processes. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screening of human mammary cDNA library identified human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (hUbc9) that interacted with SOX4. This interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation assays in vivo. Deletion mapping demonstrated that HMG-box domain of SOX4 is required to mediate the interaction with Ubc9 in yeast. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that Ubc9 co-localized with SOX4 in the nucleus. Luciferase assays found that Ubc9 specifically repressed SOX4 transcriptional activity in 293T cells. We further demonstrated that Ubc9 could functionally repress the transcriptional activity of endogenous SOX4 induced by progesterone in T47D cells. The C93S mutant of Ubc9, which abrogates SUMO-1 conjugation activity, did not abolish the ability to repress SOX4 activity. It shows that Ubc9 interacts with SOX4 and represses its transcriptional activity independent of its SUMO-1-conjugating activity.

10777545|t|Stability of the ATF2 transcription factor is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.
10777545|t|Trans-activation of the activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in response to cellular stress requires the N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 by stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK). In this study, we investigated the role of ATF2 phosphorylation in the maintenance of ATF2 stability. Activation of SAPK by forced expression of DeltaMEKK1 increased overall ATF2 ubiquitination, presumably because of the enhanced dimerization of ATF2. Treatment of DeltaMEKK1-expressing cells with okadaic acid led to the increase in N-terminal phosphorylation, protection from ubiquitination, and accumulation of exogenously expressed ATF2, indicating the role of protein phosphatases in balancing the effects of stress kinases. Analysis of ubiquitination and degradation of the constitutively dimerized ATF2 mutant (ATF2(Delta150-248)) showed that activation of JNK or p38 kinase renders ATF2 resistant to ubiquitination and degradation. This effect is mediated by JNK/p38-dependent phosphorylation of ATF2 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, because the phosphorylation-deficient mutant (ATF2(Delta150-248-T69A,T71A)) was not protected from ubiquitination and degradation by the activation of SAPK. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid elevated the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced ATF2 level and the extent of its specific N-terminal phosphorylation. Cycloheximide, which activates SAPK, while inhibiting protein synthesis, stabilized endogenous ATF2. However, treatment of cells with the high dose of SB203580, which inhibits JNK and p38 kinase, resulted in efficient degradation of ATF2 in cells exposed to cycloheximide. This degradation was abrogated by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Our findings suggest that N-terminal phosphorylation of ATF2 dimers protect ATF2 from ubiquitination and degradation. We propose the hypothesis that the balance between SAPK and protein phosphatases affects the duration and magnitude of ATF2 transcriptional output because of the effect on substrate recognition for ubiquitination and degradation.

14701845|t|Identification of a conserved sequence motif that promotes Cdc37 and cyclin D1 binding to Cdk4.
14701845|t|Cdc37 is a molecular chaperone that is important for the stability and activity of several protein kinases, including Cdk4 and Raf1. We first determined, using in vitro assays, that Cdc37 binds to the amino-terminal lobe of Cdk4. Subsequent mutagenesis revealed that Gly-15 (G15A) and Gly-18 (G18A) were critical for Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation. Gly-15 and Gly-18 of Cdk4 are within the conserved Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif that is required for ATP binding to the kinase. Mutation of either glycine at the equivalent positions of Raf1 (G358A and G361A) also inhibited Cdc37 binding to Raf1. Replacing another conserved residue critical for ATP binding and kinase activity, Lys-35 (K35A), reduced Cdc37-Cdk4 complex formation but to a lesser extent. The interaction of Cdk4 with Cdc37 in vitro was not sensitive to changes in ATP levels. Cell-based assays indicated that Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) were present at the same level as wild type Cdk4. Equivalent amounts of p16 bound to Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) relative to wild type Cdk4, suggesting that Cdk4(G15A) and Cdk4(G18A) adopt significant tertiary structure. However, in contrast to wild type Cdk4, Cdk4(G15A), and Cdk4(G18A) had greatly reduced binding of cyclin D1, Cdc37, and Hsp90. Importantly, overexpression of Cdc37 not only stimulated cyclin D1 binding to wild type Cdk4 but also restored its binding to Cdk4(G15A). Under the same conditions, p16 binding to wild type Cdk4 was suppressed. Our findings show that the interaction of Cdc37 with its client protein kinases requires amino acid residues within a motif that is present in many protein kinases.

12077252|t|Recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to CD28 inhibits HIV transcription by a Tat-dependent mechanism.
12077252|t|Activation through the TCR and the costimulatory molecule CD28 influences the susceptibility of T cells to HIV-1 infection and regulates proviral gene expression. Signaling events initiated by CD28 that directly impact HIV-1 transcription have not been fully characterized. T cell lines expressing CD8alpha/28 chimeric receptors containing a mutation in tyrosine 173 to phenylalanine, which inhibits the recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to CD28, expressed higher levels of HIV-1 following T cell activation. Whereas constitutively active PI3K decreased provirus transcription, inhibiting endogenous PI3K with specific inhibitors or by overexpressing PTEN phosphatase enhanced HIV-1 expression. PI3K-dependent inhibition required the viral Tat protein and a trans activation response region element. Tat pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that PI3K affects the formation of the Tat-associated kinase trans-activating complex. These studies demonstrate that PI3K negatively impacts HIV-1 transcription and that Tat activity is sensitive to T cell signaling events.

8797861|t|Global and local determinants for the kinetics of interleukin-4/interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain interaction. A biosensor study employing recombinant interleukin-4-binding protein.
8797861|t|An engineered interleukin-4-binding protein (IL4-BP) representing the extracellular domain of the human interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha chain was expressed in Sf9 cells. The purified IL4-BP was immobilized via a single biotinylated SH group near the carboxyl end to a biosensor matrix and analysed in real time for interaction with IL-4 and IL-4 variants. IL-4 was bound to IL4-BP at a molar ratio of approximately 1:1. The association and dissociation at pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl had rate constants of 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and 2 +/- 1 x 10(-3) s-1, respectively. Glycosylation and engineered amino acid substitutions of IL4-BP did not alter the kinetic constants as shown by a parallel analysis of IL4-BP variants produced in Escherichia coli or Chinese hamster ovary cells. The rate of association was only slightly affected in binding-deficient variants [E9Q]IL-4 and [R88Q]IL-4 and by acidic pH down to values of 4.5, but it was reduced up to fivefold at higher ionic strength. The rate of dissociation was increased 70-fold and 150-fold with the IL-4 variants and fivefold at an acidic pH of 4.5, but it was not affected by high ionic strength. Temperatures between 6 degrees C and 37 degrees C yielded similar rates of IL-4 dissociation and only a marginally reduced rate of IL-4 association at 6 degrees C. These results indicate that the high-affinity binding of IL-4 to its receptor (Kd approximately 100 pM) is mainly the result of an unusually high association rate. The IL-4/IL4-BP interaction appears to be dominated by charge effects. The exceedingly high rate of IL-4/IL4-BP association is augmented by the overall electrostatic potentials of both proteins (electrostatic steering). Localized charges and the formation of ion pairs may control the rate of complex dissociation.

10206973|t|Dimerization of the calcium-sensing receptor occurs within the extracellular domain and is eliminated by Cys --> Ser mutations at Cys101 and Cys236.
10206973|t|Calcium-sensing receptors are present in membranes as dimers that can be reduced to monomers with sufhydryl reagents. All studies were carried out on the human calcium-sensing receptor tagged at the carboxyl terminus with green fluorescent protein (hCaR-GFP) to permit identification and localization of expressed proteins. Truncations containing either the extracellular agonist binding domain plus transmembrane helix 1 (ECD/TMH1-GFP) or the transmembrane domain plus the intracellular carboxyl terminus (TMD/carboxyl terminus-GFP) were used to identify the dimerization domain. ECD/TMH1-GFP was a dimer in the absence of reducing reagents, whereas TMD/carboxyl-terminal GFP was a monomer in the absence or presence of reducing agents, suggesting that dimerization occurs via the ECD. To identify the residue(s) involved in dimerization within the ECD, cysteine --> serine point mutations were made in residues that are conserved between hCaR and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Mutations at positions 60 and 131 were expressed at levels comparable to wild type in HEK 293 cells, had minimal effects on hCaR function, and did not eliminate dimerization, whereas mutations at positions 101 and 236 greatly decreased receptor expression and resulted in significant amounts of monomer in the absence of reducing agents. The double point mutant hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP was expressed more robustly than either C101S or C236S and covalent dimerization was eliminated. hCaR(C101S/C236S)-GFP had a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2+ and slower response kinetics upon increases or decreases in agonist concentration. These results suggest that covalent, disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of the calcium-sensing receptor contributes to stabilization of the ECD and to acceleration of the transitions between inactive and active receptor conformations.

14647410|t|Tumor-derived C-terminal mutations of Smad4 with decreased DNA binding activity and enhanced intramolecular interaction.
14647410|t|Smad4 is a critical component in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling and frequently mutated in pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Smad4 has two important functional domains, MH1 and MH2, that are involved in different biological processes. The MH1 domain comprises a DNA binding domain and the MH2 domain is mainly implicated in transcriptional activation and homo- and heteromeric complex formation among Smad proteins. In the present study, a total of nine Smad4 mutations at both MH1 and MH2 domains were analysed and all of them had a reduced activity to stimulate transcription of a TGF-beta-responsive reporter gene. All four MH1 mutations had a markedly reduced ability to bind a consensus Smad binding element by an in vitro assay using GST fusion proteins. Among the MH2 mutations, R497H, K507Q, and R515G mutations of Smad4 gave rise to a reduced DNA binding capacity. The R497H mutation had a slightly reduced interaction with Smad2 upon activation of TGF-beta receptor. However, the K507Q and R515G mutations greatly lost their ability to associate with Smad2. Using a GST pull-down assay, it was found that the Smad4 MH2 domain bearing R497H and R515G mutations had an enhanced interaction with the MH1 region of the Smad4 protein, indicating that an increased intramolecular interaction by these mutations may alleviate the DNA binding activity at the MH1 domain. Consistent with these observations, the MH2 domain with R497H mutation had an enhanced ability to inhibit TGF-beta receptor-mediated transcription. In addition, the full-length R497H mutation was able to antagonize TGF-beta signaling in a dominant-negative manner. Therefore, these studies revealed novel mechanisms by which the Smad4 mutations utilize to abrogate their functions in transducing the signaling of TGF-beta, which plays an important role in various stages of cancer formation.

21454680|t|Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) stabilizes MyoD through direct phosphorylation at tyrosine 156 during myogenic differentiation.
21454680|t|Previously, we reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) activated in the mid-stage of skeletal muscle differentiation promotes myogenic differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we investigated an activity of MEK1 for MyoD. Activated MEK1 associates with MyoD in the nucleus of differentiating myoblasts. In vitro kinase assay using active MEK1, a (32)P-labeled protein band corresponding to GST-MyoD was observed but not to mutant GST-MyoD-Y156F. Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous MyoD was detected with a specific anti-pMyoD-Y156 antibody; however, this response was blocked by PD184352, a MEK-specific inhibitor. These results indicate that activated MEK1 phosphorylates the MyoD-Y156 residue directly. Interestingly, the protein level of mutant MyoD-Y156F decreased compared with that of wild type but was recovered in the presence of lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor. The protein level of MyoD-Y156E, which mimics phosphorylation at Tyr-156, was above that of wild type, indicating that the phosphorylation protects MyoD from the ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition, the low protein level of MyoD-Y156F was recovered over that of wild type by an additional mutation at Leu-164, a critical binding residue of MAFbx/AT-1, a Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) E3-ubiquitin ligase. The amount of MyoD co-precipitated with MAFbx/AT-1 also was reduced in the presence of active MEK1. Thus, these results suggested that the phosphorylation probably interrupts the binding of MAFbx/AT-1 to MyoD and thereby increases its stability. Collectively, our results suggest that MEK1 activated in differentiating myoblasts stimulates muscle differentiation by phosphorylating MyoD-Y156, which results in MyoD stabilization.

10068444|t|Modulation of the protein tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by its juxtamembrane region.
10068444|t|Using peptides epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-13 and EGFR-14, which correspond to residues 645-657 and 679-692, respectively, in the juxtamembrane, cytosolic region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) we have investigated the role of specific regions of the receptor in regulating its autophosphorylation and protein tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14, increased autophosphorylation (by twofold) of the full-length and two truncated forms (Delta1022-1186 and a constitutively active receptor kinase domain) of the EGFR. EGFR-13 increased the stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation of the full-length receptor from 4.2 to 10.1 mol Pi/mol EGFR and that of EGFRDelta1022-1186 from 1.0 to 2 mol Pi/mol receptor. Increased receptor autophosphorylation in the presence of EGFR-13 cannot solely be attributed to an increase in tyrosine kinase activity because EGFR-14 and polylysine increased tyrosine kinase activity of EGFRDelta1022-1186 and full-length EGFR, respectively, to the same extent as EGFR-13 without any effects on receptor autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of EGFR-13 (P-EGFR-13) on the threonine residue corresponding to Thr654 in EGFR obliterated the ability of the peptide to increase autophosphorylation and markedly diminished its capacity to increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Additionally, EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14 or P-EGFR-13, decreased the migration of the receptor on nondenaturing gels, indicating that EGFR-13 induces some conformational change. Phosphopeptide maps of the EGFR phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR-13 or pp60(c-src) demonstrated that the additional sites phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR-13 were the same as those phosphorylated by pp60(c-src) (i.e., Y803, Y845, Y891, Y920, and Y1101). Thus, we conclude that EGFR-13, but not EGFR-14 or P-EGFR-13, competes to disrupt interactions between amino acids 645-657 and some other region(s) on the EGFR to either alleviate a conformational constraint or alter dimer conformation. This change increases the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR and provides access to additional tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the receptor.

12522011|t|Role of the intracellular domains of GPIb in controlling the adhesive properties of the platelet GPIb/V/IX complex.
12522011|t|Glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX complex-dependent platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) is supported by the 45-kd N-terminal extracellular domain of the GPIb alpha subunit. Recent results with an adhesion blocking antibody (RAM.1) against GPIb beta, which is disulfide linked to GPIb alpha, have suggested a novel function of this subunit in regulating VWF-mediated platelet adhesion, possibly involving its intracellular face. A putative cooperation between the GPIb alpha and GPIb beta cytoplasmic domains was investigated by measuring the adhesion under flow to immobilized VWF of K562 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with GPIb/(V)/IX containing mutations in this region. Adhesion of cells carrying a glycine substitution of the GPIb beta Ser166 phosphorylation site was 50% lower than normal and became insensitive to inhibition by RAM.1. In contrast, forskolin or PGE(1) treatment increased both the phosphorylation of GPIb beta and adhesion of control cells, both effects being reversed by RAM.1, but had no influence on cells expressing the Ser166Gly mutation. A role of the GPIb alpha intracellular domain was also apparent as the VWF-dependent adhesion of cells containing deletions of the entire (Delta 518-610) or portions (Delta 535-568, Delta 569-610) of the GPIb alpha cytoplasmic tail was insensitive to RAM.1 inhibition. Cells carrying progressive 11 amino acid deletions spanning the GPIb alpha 535-590 region were equally unresponsive to RAM.1, with the exception of those containing GPIb alpha Delta 569-579, which behaved like control cells. These findings support a role of the GPIb beta intracellular domain in controlling the adhesive properties of the GPIb/V/IX complex through phosphorylation of GPIb beta Ser166 and point to the existence of cross-talk between the GPIb beta and GPIb alpha intracellular domains.

11399766|t|Functional interaction of p53 and BLM DNA helicase in apoptosis.
11399766|t|The Bloom syndrome (BS) protein, BLM, is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family that also includes the Werner syndrome protein, WRN. Inherited mutations in these proteins are associated with cancer predisposition of these patients. We recently discovered that cells from Werner syndrome patients displayed a deficiency in p53-mediated apoptosis and WRN binds to p53. Here, we report that analogous to WRN, BLM also binds to p53 in vivo and in vitro, and the C-terminal domain of p53 is responsible for the interaction. p53-mediated apoptosis is defective in BS fibroblasts and can be rescued by expression of the normal BLM gene. Moreover, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from BS donors are resistant to both gamma-radiation and doxorubicin-induced cell killing, and sensitivity can be restored by the stable expression of normal BLM. In contrast, BS cells have a normal Fas-mediated apoptosis, and in response to DNA damage normal accumulation of p53, normal induction of p53 responsive genes, and normal G(1)-S and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest. BLM localizes to nuclear foci referred to as PML nuclear bodies (NBs). Cells from Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients carrying p53 germline mutations and LCLs lacking a functional p53 have a decreased accumulation of BLM in NBs, whereas isogenic lines with functional p53 exhibit normal accumulation. Certain BLM mutants (C1055S or Delta133-237) that have a reduced ability to localize to the NBs when expressed in normal cells can impair the localization of wild type BLM to NBs and block p53-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. Taken together, our results indicate both a novel mechanism of p53 function by which p53 mediates nuclear trafficking of BLM to NBs and the cooperation of p53 and BLM to induce apoptosis.

10677230|t|Identification of a region at the N-terminus of phospholipase C-beta 3 that interacts with G protein beta gamma subunits.
10677230|t|Members of the phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) family of proteins are activated either by G alpha or G beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. To define specific regions of PLC-beta 3 that are involved in binding and activation by G beta gamma, a series of fragments of PLC-beta 3 as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced. A fragment encompassing the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and downstream sequence (GST-N) bound to G protein beta 1 gamma 2 in an in vitro binding assay, and binding was inhibited by G protein alpha subunit, G alpha i1. This PLC-beta 3 fragment also inhibited G beta gamma-stimulated PLC-beta activity in a reconstitution system, while having no significant effect on G alpha q-stimulated PLC-beta 3 activity. The N-terminal G beta gamma binding region was delineated further to the first 180 amino acids, and the sequence Asn150-Ser180, just distal to the PH domain, was found to be required for the interaction. Mutation of basic residues 154Arg, 155Lys, 159Lys, and 161Lys to Glu within this region reduced G beta gamma binding affinity and specifically reduced the EC50 for G beta gamma-dependent activation of the mutant enzyme 3-fold. Basal activity and G alpha q-dependent activation of the enzyme were unaffected by the mutations. While these basic residues may not directly mediate the interaction with G beta gamma, the data provide evidence for an N-terminal G beta gamma binding region of PLC-beta 3 that is involved in activation of the enzyme.

26876500|t|Mass spectrometry analysis of the oxidation states of the pro-oncogenic protein anterior gradient-2 reveals covalent dimerization via an intermolecular disulphide bond.
26876500|t|Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2) is a component of a pro-oncogenic signalling pathway that can promote p53 inhibition, metastatic cell migration, limb regeneration, and cancer drug-resistance. AGR2 is in the protein-disulphide isomerase superfamily containing a single cysteine (Cys-81) that forms covalent adducts with its client proteins. We have found that mutation of Cysteine-81 attenuates its biochemical activity in its sequence-specific peptide docking function, reduces binding to Reptin, and reduces its stability in cells. As such, we evaluated how chemical oxidation of its cysteine affects its biochemical properties. Recombinant AGR2 spontaneously forms covalent dimers in the absence of reductant whilst DTT promotes dimer to monomer conversion. Mutation of Cysteine-81 to alanine prevents peroxide catalysed dimerization of AGR2 in vitro, suggesting a reactive cysteine is central to covalent dimer formation. Both biochemical assays and ESI mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate that low levels of a chemical oxidant promote an intermolecular disulphide bond through formation of a labile sulfenic acid intermediate. However, higher levels of oxidant promote sulfinic or sulfonic acid formation thus preventing covalent dimerization of AGR2. These data together identify the single cysteine of AGR2 as an oxidant responsive moiety that regulates its propensity for oxidation and its monomeric-dimeric state. This has implications for redox regulation of the pro-oncogenic functions of AGR2 protein in cancer cells.

9178913|t|Bcr phosphorylated on tyrosine 177 binds Grb2.
9178913|t|We and others have shown that the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein binds activators of the Ras pathway such as Grb2 and Shc. Grb2 binding is mediated through a phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Y177) located within a consensus Grb2 binding site encoded by the first exon of the BCR gene. Our results indicate that P160 BCR is tyrosine phosphorylated at the same site by Bcr-Abl in kinase assays (Puil et al., 1994). We performed experiments to determine whether Bcr, which was tyrosine phosphorylated within cells by activated c-Abl, could also bind Grb2, and whether phosphotyrosine 177 was the major binding site. Complexes between Bcr and Abl were detected in a hemopoietic cell line lacking Bcr-Abl and in COS1 cells coexpressing both Bcr and Abl proteins. P160 BCR was tyrosine phosphorylated in COS1 cells coexpressing Abl and Bcr proteins. Similarly, various deletion mutants of Bcr including BCRN553, BCRN413 and BCRN221 were tyrosine phosphorylated by activated c-Abl whereas BCRN159 was not. Wild-type Bcr and Bcr Y177F were examined under these conditions for their ability to co-precipitate with Grb2. The results showed that while wild-type tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr efficiently bound Grb2, tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F had greatly reduced Grb2-binding ability. Studies with GST-SH2 (Grb2) revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr was able to bind to GST SH2 (Grb2) but tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr Y177F was deficient in binding. These results indicate that the Bcr protein when phosphorylated at tyrosine 177 binds Grb2, thereby implicating Bcr as a potantial activator of the Ras pathway.

11742726|t|Lack of binding observed between human alpha-synuclein and Bcl-2 protein family.
11742726|t|alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein of unknown function that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. To gain insight into the function of alpha-synuclein, the present study examined the association between alpha-synuclein and the following Bcl-2 family proteins: Bcl-2; Bcl-XL; Bcl-associated death promoter (BAD); and Bcl-2-associated X-protein. The results of a binding assay using gluthathione S-transferase (GST) fusion alpha-synuclein protein and an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that wild-type or mutant (A30P and A53T) alpha-synuclein (approximately 16 kDa) does not bind to any of these members of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, no binding was observed between alpha-synuclein and BAD, regardless of the phosphorylation state of the serine residue in BAD. In contrast, alpha-synuclein was observed to bind to synphilin-1. Although alpha-synuclein has been reported to bind to BAD, modification of alpha-synuclein might be required for such binding to occur.

12865432|t|Regulation of Raf through phosphorylation and N terminus-C terminus interaction.
12865432|t|Raf kinase is a key component in regulating the MAPK pathway. B-Raf has been reported as an oncogene and is mutated in 60% of human melanomas. The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation. In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called 22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation.

9632788|t|Growth suppression by an E2F-binding-defective retinoblastoma protein (RB): contribution from the RB C pocket.
9632788|t|Growth suppression by the retinoblastoma protein (RB) is dependent on its ability to form complexes with transcription regulators. At least three distinct protein-binding activities have been identified in RB: the large A/B pocket binds E2F, the A/B pocket binds the LXCXE peptide motif, and the C pocket binds the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase. Substitution of Trp for Arg 661 in the B region of RB (mutant 661) inactivates both E2F and LXCXE binding. The tumor suppression function of mutant 661 is not abolished, because this allele predisposes its carriers to retinoblastoma development with a low penetrance. In cell-based assays, 661 is shown to inhibit G1/S progression. This low-penetrance mutant also induces terminal growth arrest with reduced but detectable activity. We have constructed mutations that disrupt C pocket activity. When overproduced, the RB C-terminal fragment did not induce terminal growth arrest but could inhibit G1/S progression, and this activity was abolished by the C-pocket mutations. In full-length RB, the C-pocket mutations reduced but did not abolish RB function. Interestingly, combination of the C-pocket and 661 mutations completely abolished RB's ability to cause an increase in the percentage of cells in G1 and to induce terminal growth arrest. These results suggest that the A/B or C region can induce a prolongation of G1 through mechanisms that are independent of each other. In contrast, long-term growth arrest requires combined activities from both regions of RB. In addition, E2F and LXCXE binding are not the only mechanisms through which RB inhibits cell growth. The C pocket also contributes to RB-mediated growth suppression.

12058028|t|The stress-activated protein kinases p38 alpha and JNK1 stabilize p21(Cip1) by phosphorylation.
12058028|t|Stress signals activate the SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK classes of protein kinases, which mediate cellular responses, including steps in apoptosis and the maturation of some cell types. We now show that stress signals initiated by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induce G(1) arrest through protein stabilization of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1). TGF-beta 1 was previously shown to increase p21 protein levels, which in turn mediated G(1) arrest through inactivation of the CDK2-cyclin E complex in HD3 cells (Yan, Z., Kim, G.-Y., Deng, X., and Friedman, E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9870-9879). We now demonstrate that the increase in p21 abundance is caused by a post-transcriptional, SMAD-independent mechanism. TGF-beta1 activated p38 alpha and JNK1, which initiated the phosphorylation of p21. TGF-beta1 treatment increased the half-life of p21 by 3-4-fold. The increase in p21 stability was detected following activation of p38 alpha and JNK1, and treatment of cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prevented this increase in p21 stability. p38 alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 in vivo, and both p38 alpha and JNK1 phosphorylated p21 at Ser(130) in vitro. Peptide mapping demonstrated that both TGF-beta 1 and p38 alpha induced phosphorylation of p21 at Ser(130) in vivo, and mutation of Ser(130) to alanine rendered p21 less stable than wild-type p21. TGF-beta 1 increased the stability of wild-type p21, but not the p21-S130A mutant. These findings demonstrate that SAPKs can mediate cell cycle arrest through post-translational modification of p21.

8846784|t|Identification of novel phosphorylation sites required for activation of MAPKAP kinase-2.
8846784|t|MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-2 is activated in vivo by reactivating kinase (RK), a MAP kinase (MAPK) homologue stimulated by cytokines and cellular stresses. Here we show that in vitro RK phosphorylates human GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 at Thr25 in the proline-rich N-terminal region Thr222 and Ser272 in the catalytic domain and Thr334 in the C-terminal domain. Using novel methodology we demonstrate that activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 requires the phosphorylation of any two of the three residues Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334. Ser9, Thr25, Thr222, Ser272, Thr334 and Thr338 became 32P-labelled in stressed KB cells and labelling was prevented by the specific RK inhibitor SB 203580, establishing that RK phosphorylates Thr25, Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334 in vivo. The 32P-labelling of Thr338 is likely to result from autophosphorylation. GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 lacking the N-terminal domain was inactive, but activated fully when phosphorylated at Thr222, Ser272 and Thr334 by p42 MAPK or RK. In contrast, full-length GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 was phosphorylated at Thr25 (and not activated) by p42 MAPK, suggesting a role for the N-terminal domain in specifying activation by RK in vivo. The mutant Asp222/Asp334 was 20% as active as phosphorylated MAPKAP kinase-2, and this constitutively active form may be useful for studying its physiological roles.

16049007|t|Tumor-suppressive maspin regulates cell response to oxidative stress by direct interaction with glutathione S-transferase.
16049007|t|Maspin, a novel serine protease inhibitor, suppresses tumor progression in several cancer models, including an in vivo model for prostate cancer bone metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of maspin remains illusive, primarily because its molecular targets are unknown. To this end, we used a full-length maspin cDNA bait to screen against both a primary prostate tumor cDNA prey library and a HeLa cDNA prey library by the yeast two-hybrid method. We found that heat shock protein 90, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and heat shock protein 70 interacted with maspin with the highest frequencies. We confirmed the maspin/GST interaction using purified proteins, human epithelial cell lines, and human prostate tissues. A maspin variant that has a point mutation of Arg(340) to Ala (Mas(R340A)) showed a significantly decreased affinity for GST. Although purified maspin had no effect on the activity of purified GST in vitro, intracellular interaction between endogenous maspin and GST correlated with an elevated total GST activity in both MDA-MB-435- and DU145-derived stably transfected cells. Consistently, tumor cells treated with purified wild type maspin, but not Mas(R340A), enhanced cellular GST activity. Maspin expression in cancer cell lines also correlated with decreased basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, H(2)O(2) treatment not only induced GST expression but also increased intracellular maspin/GST interaction, which was inversely correlated with the level of ROS generation. Conversely, maspin knockdown by small interfering RNA increased the basal, as well as H(2)O(2)-induced, ROS generation. Furthermore, the maspin effect on ROS generation was completely abolished by a GST inhibitor, indicating an essential role of GST in maspin-mediated cellular response to oxidative stress. Consistently, oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A expression was significantly inhibited in maspin-expressing cells. Together, our data suggest a new mechanism by which maspin, through its direct interaction with GST, may inhibit oxidative stress-induced ROS generation and vascular endothelial growth factor A induction, thus preventing further adverse effects on tumor genetics and stromal reactivity.

15769741|t|Oligomerization and multimerization are critical for angiopoietin-1 to bind and phosphorylate Tie2.
15769741|t|Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is an essential molecule for blood vessel formation; however, little is known about the structure-function relationships of Ang1 with its receptor, Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domain-2'). In this study, we generated several Ang1 and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) variants to define the role of the superclustering and oligomerization domains of the Ang1 protein. Then we analyzed the molecular structure of the variants with SDS-PAGE and rotary metal-shadowing transmission electron microscopy (RMSTEM) and determined the effects of these variants on the binding and activation of Tie2. Ang1 exists as heterogeneous multimers with basic trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers, whereas Ang2 exists as trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric oligomers. The variant Ang1C265S, consisting of trimers, tetramers, and pentamers without multimeric forms of Ang1, yielded less Tie2 activation than did Ang1, whereas monomeric Ang1 (Ang1/FD), dimeric Ang1 variants (Ang1D2, and Ang1D3), and dimeric and trimeric Ang1 variant (Ang1D1) dramatically lost their ability to bind and activate Tie2. An Ang1 protein in which two cysteines (amino acids 41 and 54) were replaced with serines (Ang1C41S/C54S) formed mostly dimers and trimers that were not able to bind and activate Tie2. In addition, improper creation of a new cysteine in Ang2 (Ang2S263C) dramatically induced Ang2 aggregation without activating Tie2. In conclusion, proper oligomerization of Ang1 having at least four subunits by the intermolecular disulfide linkage involving cysteines 41 and 54 is critical for Tie2 binding and activation. Thus, our data shed a light on the structure-function relationships of Ang1 with Tie2.

8662907|t|Interaction between the amino-terminal SH3 domain of CRK and its natural target proteins.
8662907|t|CRK is a human homolog of chichen v-Crk, which is an adaptor protein. The SH2 domain of CRK binds to several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, p130(Cas), Shc, and paxillin. The SH3 domain, in turn, binds to cytosolic proteins of 135-145, 160, 180, and 220 kDa. We screened expression libraries by Far Western blotting, using CRK SH3 as a probe, and identified partial cDNA sequences of four distinct proteins, including C3G, DOCK180, EPS15, and clone ST12. The consensus sequence of the CRK SH3 binding sites as deduced from their amino acid sequences was Pro+3-Pro+2-X+1-Leu0-Pro-1-X-2-Lys-3. The interaction of the CRK SH3 domain with the DOCK180 peptide was examined with an optical biosensor, based on the principles of surface plasmon resonance. A low dissociation constant of the order of 10(-7) resulted from a high association rate constant (kassoc = 3 x 10(4)) and low dissociation rate constant (kdiss = 3 x 10(-3)). All CRK-binding proteins except clone ST12 also bound to another adaptor protein, Grb2. Mutational analysis revealed that glycine at position +1 of ST12 inhibited the binding to Grb2 while retaining the high affinity binding to CRK SH3. The result suggests that the amino acid at position +1 also contributes to the high affinity binding of the peptides to the SH3 domain of Grb2, but not to that of CRK.

16581787|t|CtIP activates its own and cyclin D1 promoters via the E2F/RB pathway during G1/S progression.
16581787|t|Cell cycle progression from G(1) to S phase is mainly controlled by E2F transcription factors and RB family proteins. Previously we showed that the presence of CtIP is essential for G(1)/S transition in primary mouse blastocysts, as well as in NIH 3T3 cells. However, how CtIP executes this function remains to be elucidated. Here we show that in NIH 3T3 cells the expression of CtIP is regulated by the E2F/RB pathway during late G(1) and S phases. The presence of wild-type CtIP, but not the E157K mutant form, which failed to interact with RB, enhanced its own promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the recruitment of CtIP to its promoter occurs concomitantly with TFIIB, a component of the RNA polymerase II complex, and with dissociation of RB from the promoter during late G(1) and G(1)/S transition. Similar positive regulation of cyclin D1 expression by CtIP was also observed. Consistently, cells expressing the CtIP(E157K) protein alone exhibited growth retardation, an increase in the G(1) population, and a decrease in the S-phase population. Taken together, these results suggest that, contrary to the postulated universal corepressor role, CtIP activates a subset of E2F-responsive promoters by releasing RB-imposed repression and therefore promotes G(1)/S progression.

20688913|t|ATP binding to Hsp90 is sufficient for effective chaperoning of p53 protein.
20688913|t|Hsp90 is a ubiquitous, ATP-dependent chaperone, essential for eukaryotes. It possesses a broad spectrum of substrates, among which is the p53 transcription factor, encoded by a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we elucidate the role of the adenine nucleotide in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle, by taking advantage of a unique in vitro assay measuring Hsp90-dependent p53 binding to the promoter sequence. E42A and D88N Hsp90β variants bind but do not hydrolyze ATP, whereas E42A has increased and D88N decreased ATP affinity, compared with WT Hsp90β. Nevertheless, both of these mutants interact with WT p53 with a similar affinity. Surprisingly, in the case of WT, but also E42A Hsp90β, the presence of ATP stimulates dissociation of Hsp90-p53 complexes and results in p53 binding to the promoter sequence. D88N Hsp90β is not efficient in both of these reactions. Using a trap version of the chaperonin GroEL, which irreversibly captures unfolded proteins, we show that Hsp90 chaperone action on WT p53 results in a partial unfolding of the substrate. The ATP-dependent dissociation of p53-Hsp90 complex allows further folding of p53 protein to an active conformation, able to bind to the promoter sequence. Furthermore, in support of these results, the overproduction of WT or E42A Hsp90β stimulates transcription from the WAF1 gene promoter in H1299 cells. Altogether, our research indicates that ATP binding to Hsp90β is a sufficient step for effective WT p53 client protein chaperoning.

10627461|t|Cytoplasmic domains of GpIbalpha and GpIbbeta regulate 14-3-3zeta binding to GpIb/IX/V.
10627461|t|Shear stress causes the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) Ib/IX/V to bind to von Willebrand factor, resulting in platelet adhesion. GpIb/IX/V also functions to stimulate transmembranous signaling, leading to platelet activation and the expression of a ligand-receptive GpIIb-IIIa complex. The highly conserved cytoplasmic domain of GpIbalpha binds directly to a dimeric 14-3-3 adapter protein zeta isoform. To explore structural determinants of GpIb/IX/V binding to 14-3-3zeta, the authors examined 14-3-3zeta interactions with GpIbalpha and GpIbbeta in heterologous cells and platelets. Truncations of GpIbalpha at amino acid 542 or 594, or deletions of residues 542 through 590, inhibited binding of 14-3-3zeta. Deletion of GpIbalpha from Trp(570) to Ser(590) eliminated 14-3-3zeta binding, and deletion of the sequence from Arg(542)-Trp(570) enhanced binding of 14-3-3zeta to GpIbalpha. All GpIbalpha mutations that eliminated GpIbalpha binding to the GST-14-3-3zeta fusion protein also eliminated GpIbbeta binding to the fusion protein. Forskolin treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type GpIbalpha/beta/IX resulted in the phosphorylation of GpIbbeta associated with enhanced binding of GpIbbeta to GST-14-3-3zeta fusion protein and increased 14-3-3zeta coimmunoprecipitated with GpIbalpha. When intact human platelets aggregated in response to 90 dynes/cm(2) shear stress, 14-3-3zeta disassociated from GpIbalpha. Prostacyclin treatment of platelets inhibited shear stress-induced aggregation and the release of 14-3-3zeta from GpIbalpha. These data demonstrate that amino acid residues in the cytoskeletal interaction domains of GpIbalpha regulate 14-3-3zeta binding to GpIbalpha/beta/IX, and suggest that protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of GpIbbeta enhances 14-3-3zeta binding to the GpIb/IX/V complex in human platelets.

14724178|t|Progesterone and insulin stimulation of CPEB-dependent polyadenylation is regulated by Aurora A and glycogen synthase kinase-3.
14724178|t|Progesterone stimulation of Xenopus oocyte maturation requires the cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation of mos and cyclin B mRNAs. One cis element that drives polyadenylation is the CPE, which is bound by the protein CPEB. Polyadenylation is stimulated by Aurora A (Eg2)-catalyzed CPEB serine 174 phosphorylation, which occurs soon after oocytes are exposed to progesterone. Here, we show that insulin also stimulates Aurora A-catalyzed CPEB S174 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic polyadenylation, translation, and oocyte maturation. However, these insulin-induced events are uniquely controlled by PI3 kinase and PKC-zeta, which act upstream of Aurora A. The intersection of the progesterone and insulin signaling pathways occurs at glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), which regulates the activity of Aurora A. GSK-3 and Aurora A interact in vivo, and overexpressed GSK-3 inhibits Aurora A-catalyzed CPEB phosphorylation. In vitro, GSK-3 phosphorylates Aurora A on S290/291, the result of which is an autophosphorylation of serine 349. GSK-3 phosphorylated Aurora A, or Aurora A proteins with S290/291D or S349D mutations, have reduced or no capacity to phosphorylate CPEB. Conversely, Aurora A proteins with S290/291A or S349A mutations are constitutively active. These results suggest that the progesterone and insulin stimulate maturation by inhibiting GSK-3, which allows Aurora A activation and CPEB-mediated translation.

16091361|t|Inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling by the huntingtin-binding protein optineurin.
16091361|t|Huntington disease is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein (Htt) and is associated with excitotoxic death of striatal neurons. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that are coupled to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation and the release of intracellular Ca(2+) stores play an important role in regulating neuronal function. We show here that mGluRs interact with the Htt-binding protein optineurin that is also linked to normal pressure open angled glaucoma and, when expressed in HEK 293 cells, optineurin functions to antagonize agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. We find that Htt is co-precipitated with mGluR1a and that mutant Htt functions to facilitate optineurin-mediated attenuation of mGluR1a signaling. In striatal cell lines derived from Htt(Q111/Q111) mutant knock-in mice mGluR5-stimulated inositol phosphate formation is also severely impaired when compared with striatal cells derived from Htt(Q7/Q7) knock-in mice. In addition, we show that a missense single nucleotide polymorphism optineurin H486R variant previously identified to be associated with glaucoma is selectively impaired in mutant Htt binding. Although optineurin H486R retains the capacity to bind to mGluR1a, optineurin H486R-dependent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling is not enhanced by the expression of mutant Htt. Because G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) protein expression is relatively low in striatal tissue, we propose that optineurin may substitute for GRK2 in the striatum to mediate mGluR desensitization. Taken together, these studies identify a novel mechanism for mGluR desensitization and an additional biochemical link between altered glutamate receptor signaling and Huntington disease.

10783152|t|Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) signaling in PC12 cells: activation of juxtamembrane domains in PDGFR/DDR/TrkA chimeric receptors.
10783152|t|The discoidin domain receptor (DDR1) is characterized by a discoidin I motif in the extracellular domain, an unusually long cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM) region, and a kinase domain that is 45% identical to that of the NGF receptor, TrkA. DDR1 also has a major splice form, which has a 37 amino acid insert in the JM region with a consensus Shc PTB site that is lacking in the shorter receptor. One class of ligands for the DDR receptors has recently been identified as being derived from the collagen family, but neither native PC12 cells, which express modest amounts of DDR1, nor transfected PC12 cells, which express much larger amounts of DDR1, respond to this ligand. A chimeric receptor, containing the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta fused to the transmembrane and intracellular regions of DDR1, also fails to mediate neuronal-like differentiation in stably transfected PC12 cells and is only weakly autophosphorylated. However, chimeric receptors, which are composed of combinations of intracellular regions from DDR1 and TrkA (with the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta), in some cases provided ligand (PDGF) -inducible receptor responses. Those with the TrkA kinase domain and the DDR1 JM regions were able to produce differentiation to varying degrees, whereas the opposite combination did not. Analysis of the signaling responses of the two chimeras with DDR1 JM sequences (with and without the insert) indicated that the shorter sequence bound and activated FRS2 whereas the insert-containing form activated Shc instead. Both activated PLCgamma through the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of the TrkA domain (Y785 in TrkA residue numbering). Mutation of this site (Y-->F) eliminated PLCgamma activation (indicating there are no other cryptic binding sites for PLCgamma in the DDR1 sequences) and markedly reduced the differentiative activity of the receptor. This is in contrast to TrkA (or PDGFRbeta/TrkA chimeras), where ablation of this pathway has no notable effect on PC12 cell morphogenic responses. Thus, the activation of FRS2 and Shc (leading to MAPK activation) is weaker in the DDR1/TrkA chimeras than in TrkA alone, and the PLCgamma contribution becomes essential for full response. Nonetheless, both DDR1 JM regions contain potentially usable signaling sites, albeit they apparently are not activated directly in DDR1 (or DDR1 chimeras) in a ligand-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that the DDR1 receptors do have signaling capacity but may require additional components or altered conditions to fully activate their kinase domains and/or sustain the activation of the JM sites.

24475316|t|LIN-9 phosphorylation on threonine-96 is required for transcriptional activation of LIN-9 target genes and promotes cell cycle progression.
24475316|t|Cell cycle transitions are governed by the timely expression of cyclins, the activating subunits of Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which are responsible for the inactivation of the pocket proteins. Overexpression of cyclins promotes cell proliferation and cancer. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which cyclins regulate the expression of cell cycle promoting genes including subsequent cyclins. LIN-9 and the pocket proteins p107 and p130 are members of the DREAM complex that in G0 represses cell cycle genes. Interestingly, little is know about the regulation and function of LIN-9 after phosphorylation of p107,p130 by Cyclin D/Cdk4 disassembles the DREAM complex in early G1. In this report, we demonstrate that cyclin E1/Cdk3 phosphorylates LIN-9 on Thr-96. Mutating Thr-96 to alanine inhibits activation of cyclins A2 and B1 promoters, whereas a phosphomimetic Asp mutant strongly activates their promoters and triggers accelerated entry into G2/M phase in 293T cells. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role for cyclin E1 beyond G1/S and into S/G2 phase, most likely by inducing the expression of subsequent cyclins A2 and B1 through LIN-9.

8639815|t|Tyrosine 425 within the activated erythropoietin receptor binds Syp, reduces the erythropoietin required for Syp tyrosine phosphorylation, and promotes mitogenesis.
8639815|t|Erythropoietin (Epo), the primary in vivo stimulator of erythroid proliferation and differentiation, acts, in part, by altering the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of various intracellular signaling molecules. These phosphorylation levels are tightly regulated by both tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. We have recently shown that the SH2 containing tyrosine phosphatase, Syp, binds directly to both the tyrosine phosphorylated form of the Epo receptor (EpoR) and to Grb2 after Epo stimulation of M07e cells engineered to express high levels of human EpoRs (T. Tauchi, et al: J Biol Chem 270:5631, 1995). To determine which tyrosine within the EpoR is responsible for binding Syp, we examined DA-3 cell lines expressing full-length mutant EpoRs bearing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions for each of the eight tyrosines within the intracellular domain of the EpoR. We found that: (1) all Epo-stimulated mutant EpoRs, except for the Y425F EpoR, coimmunoprecipitated with Syp; (2) all Epo-stimulated mutant EpoRs, except for the Y425F EpoR, bound to a GST-fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of Syp; (3) Jak2 could phosphorylate GST-Syp in vitro after Epo stimulation of wild-type (wt) EpoR expressing DA-3 cells; (4) Epo-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Syp in vivo was markedly reduced in Y425F EpoR expressing DA-3 calls; and (5) DA-3 cells expressing the Y425F EpoR grow less well in response to Epo than wt EpoR expressing cells. These results suggest that Syp binds via its SH2 domains to phosphorylated Y425 within the EpoR and is then phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by Jak2. Moreover, Y425 in the EpoR reduces the Epo requirement for Syp tyrosine phosphorylation and promotes proliferation.

21768120|t|Nucleotides and phosphorylation bi-directionally modulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B.
21768120|t|The Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor are key regulators of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Direct binding of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B (formerly known as NR2B) (i) is induced by Ca(2+)/CaM but outlasts this initial Ca(2+)-stimulus, (ii) mediates CaMKII translocation to synapses, and (iii) regulates synaptic strength. CaMKII binds to GluN2B around S1303, the major CaMKII phosphorylation site on GluN2B. We show here that a phospho-mimetic S1303D mutation inhibited CaM-induced CaMKII binding to GluN2B in vitro, presenting a conundrum how binding can occur within cells, where high ATP concentration should promote S1303 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, addition of ATP actually enhanced the binding. Mutational analysis revealed that this positive net effect was caused by four modulatory effects of ATP, two positive (direct nucleotide binding and CaMKII T286 autophosphorylation) and two negative (GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation and CaMKII T305/6 autophosphorylation). Imaging showed positive regulation by nucleotide binding also within transfected HEK cells and neurons. In fact, nucleotide binding was a requirement for efficient CaMKII interaction with GluN2B in cells, while T286 autophosphorylation was not. Kinetic considerations support a model in which positive regulation by nucleotide binding and T286 autophosphorylation occurs faster than negative modulation by GluN2B S1303 and CaMKII T305/6 phosphorylation, allowing efficient CaMKII binding to GluN2B despite the inhibitory effects of the two slower reactions.

17653056|t|Mutations associated with retinopathies alter mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced phosphorylation of neural retina leucine-zipper.
17653056|t|PURPOSE: Neural retina leucine-zipper (NRL), a member of the basic motif leucine zipper family of transcription factors, is preferentially expressed in rod photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. Mutations in NRL are associated with retinopathies; many of these are suggested to change phosphorylation status and alter NRL-mediated transactivation of rhodopsin promoter. The purpose of this study was to identify potential kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of NRL and determine if such kinase-dependent phosphorylation is altered in disease-associated NRL mutations. METHODS: Metabolic labeling with 33P-orthophosphate was used to study phosphorylation of NRL in transfected COS-1 cells. NRL or NRL mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins and used as substrate to screen various kinases by in vitro phosphorylation assays. CV-1 cells were co-transfected with rhodopsin promoter-reporter construct and expression plasmids, with or without specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, to examine their effect on NRL-mediated transactivation. Expression of activated MAPKs in postnatal mice retina was determined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Metabolic labeling of NRL produces multiple phosphorylated protein bands in transfected COS-1 cells. Fewer but more intense radiolabeled bands are observed for NRL-S50T, -S50A, and -P51L mutants compared to wild-type NRL. We show that MAPK2 and p38 induce specific phosphorylation of NRL, but this pattern is altered in NRL mutants. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from developing mouse retina reveals enhanced expression of activated MAPK2 at postnatal day 0-3, concordant with the reported phosphorylation pattern of NRL in vivo. Inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways decreases NRL and CRX-mediated synergistic activation of rhodopsin promoter in transfected CV-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that multiple MAPKs can phosphorylate NRL and this phosphorylation pattern is altered by disease-associated NRL mutations. As inhibition of MAPK signaling pathways decreases NRL-mediated transactivation of rhodopsin promoter, we propose that phosphorylation changes associated with NRL mutations perturb gene expression in rods, leading to photoreceptor degeneration in retinopathies.

24308844|t|Molecular origin of the binding of WWOX tumor suppressor to ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase.
24308844|t|The ability of WWOX tumor suppressor to physically associate with the intracellular domain (ICD) of ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase is believed to play a central role in downregulating the transcriptional function of the latter. Herein, using various biophysical methods, we show that while the WW1 domain of WWOX binds to PPXY motifs located within the ICD of ErbB4 in a physiologically relevant manner, the WW2 domain does not. Importantly, while the WW1 domain absolutely requires the integrity of the PPXY consensus sequence, nonconsensus residues within and flanking this motif do not appear to be critical for binding. This strongly suggests that the WW1 domain of WWOX is rather promiscuous toward its cellular partners. We also provide evidence that the lack of binding of the WW2 domain of WWOX to PPXY motifs is due to the replacement of a signature tryptophan, lining the hydrophobic ligand binding groove, with tyrosine (Y85). Consistent with this notion, the Y85W substitution within the WW2 domain exquisitely restores its binding to PPXY motifs in a manner akin to the binding of the WW1 domain of WWOX. Of particular significance is the observation that the WW2 domain augments the binding of the WW1 domain to ErbB4, implying that the former serves as a chaperone within the context of the WW1-WW2 tandem module of WWOX in agreement with our findings reported previously. Altogether, our study sheds new light on the molecular basis of an important WW-ligand interaction involved in mediating a plethora of cellular processes.

19292454|t|Identification and characterization of wolframin, the product of the wolfram syndrome gene (WFS1), as a novel calmodulin-binding protein.
19292454|t|To search for calmodulin (CaM) targets, we performed affinity chromatography purification of a rat brain extract using CaM fused with GST as the affinity ligand. Proteomic analysis was then carried out to identify CaM-binding proteins. In addition to identifying 36 known CaM-binding proteins, including CaM kinases, calcineurin, nNOS, the IP(3) receptor, and Ca(2+)-ATPase, we identified an ER transmembrane protein, wolframin [the product of the Wolfram syndrome gene (WFS1)] as interacting. A CaM overlay and an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that wolframin is capable of binding the Ca(2+)/CaM complex in vitro and in transfected cells. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and zero-length cross-linking showed that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 2-285) of wolframin binds to an equimolar unit of CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with a K(D) for CaM of 0.15 muM. Various truncation and deletion mutants showed that the Ca(2+)/CaM binding region in wolframin is located from Glu90 to Trp186. Furthermore, we demonstrated that three mutations (Ala127Thr, Ala134Thr, and Arg178Pro) associated with Wolfram syndrome completely abolished CaM binding of wolframin. This observation may indicate that CaM binding is important for wolframin function and that impairment of this interaction by mutation contributes to the pathology seen in Wolfram syndrome.

11726610|t|Interaction of the insulin receptor beta-subunit with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in bovine ROS.
11726610|t|PURPOSE: To identify the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) in bovine rod outer segments (ROS) that are associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). METHODS: Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing two SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K-GST-p85 (N-SH2), GST-p85 (C-SH2), and respective SH2 mutants (N-SH2, R358A, and C-SH2, R649A)-were prepared and used to pull down tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in bovine ROS. Protein identity was established by Western blot analysis. PI3K activity was determined in the pull-down mixtures and in immunoprecipitates by incubation with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P(2)) and [gamma(32)P]adenosine triphosphate (ATP). RESULTS: The GST pull-down assays indicated the binding of a 97-kDa protein by GST-p85 (N-SH2) in tyrosine-phosphorylated (PY)-ROS that was not present in nonphosphorylated (N)-ROS. Binding was completely abolished when the Arg 358 in the N-SH2 domain was mutated to Ala. Increased binding of the p110alpha catalytic subunit to GST-p85 (N-SH2) fusion protein was also observed in the presence of the 97-kDa phosphorylated protein. Biochemical evidence indicated that the 97-kDa protein was the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor beta-subunit (IRbeta). Immunoprecipitates of PY-ROS and N-ROS with anti-PY antibodies, probed with anti-IRbeta, indicated the presence of IRbeta only in PY-ROS. Immunoprecipitates of PY-ROS and N-ROS with anti-IRbeta antibodies, probed with anti-p85 and anti-p110alpha antibodies, indicated increased amounts of both p85 and p110alpha in PY-ROS compared to N-ROS. Treatment of ROS with insulin, followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-IRbeta or anti-PY, resulted in increased PI3K activity. Expression and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of retina insulin receptor showed direct involvement with the p85 subunit of PI3K in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor is involved in the regulation of PI3K activity in ROS.

25110572|t|Nebulin interactions with actin and tropomyosin are altered by disease-causing mutations.
25110572|t|BACKGROUND: Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a rare genetic muscle disorder, but one of the most common among the congenital myopathies. NM is caused by mutations in at least nine genes: Nebulin (NEB), α-actin (ACTA1), α-tropomyosin (TPM3), β-tropomyosin (TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), cofilin-2 (CFL2), Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain-containing 13 (KBTBD13), and Kelch-like family members 40 and 41 (KLHL40 and KLHL41). Nebulin is a giant (600 to 900 kDa) filamentous protein constituting part of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Around 90% of the primary structure of nebulin is composed of approximately 35-residue α-helical domains, which form super repeats that bind actin with high affinity. Each super repeat has been proposed to harbor one tropomyosin-binding site. METHODS: We produced four wild-type (WT) nebulin super repeats (S9, S14, S18, and S22), 283 to 347 amino acids long, and five corresponding repeats with a patient mutation included: three missense mutations (p.Glu2431Lys, p.Ser6366Ile, and p.Thr7382Pro) and two in-frame deletions (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del and p.Val3924_Asn3929del). We performed F-actin and tropomyosin-binding experiments for the nebulin super repeats, using co-sedimentation and GST (glutathione-S-transferase) pull-down assays. We also used the GST pull-down assay to test the affinity of WT nebulin super repeats for WT α- and β-tropomyosin, and for β-tropomyosin with six patient mutations: p.Lys7del, p.Glu41Lys, p.Lys49del, p.Glu117Lys, p.Glu139del and p.Gln147Pro. RESULTS: WT nebulin was shown to interact with actin and tropomyosin. Both the nebulin super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation and nebulin super repeats lacking exon 55 (p.Arg2478_Asp2512del) showed weak affinity for F-actin compared with WT fragments. Super repeats containing the p.Ser6366Ile mutation showed strong affinity for actin. When tested for tropomyosin affinity, super repeats containing the p.Glu2431Lys mutation showed stronger binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin, and the super repeat containing the p.Thr7382Pro mutation showed weaker binding than WT proteins to tropomyosin. Super repeats containing the deletion p.Val3924_Asn3929del showed similar affinity for actin and tropomyosin as that seen with WT super repeats. Of the tropomyosin mutations, only p.Glu41Lys showed weaker affinity for nebulin (super repeat 18). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time the existence of direct tropomyosin-nebulin interactions in vitro, and show that nebulin interactions with actin and tropomyosin are altered by disease-causing mutations in nebulin and tropomyosin.

25911675|t|FGF8, c-Abl and p300 participate in a pathway that controls stability and function of the ΔNp63α protein.
25911675|t|The p63 transcription factor, homolog to the p53 tumor suppressor gene, plays a crucial role in epidermal and limb development, as its mutations are associated to human congenital syndromes characterized by skin, craniofacial and limb defects. While limb and skin-specific p63 transcriptional targets are being discovered, little is known of the post-translation modifications controlling ΔNp63α functions. Here we show that the p300 acetyl-transferase physically interacts in vivo with ΔNp63α and catalyzes its acetylation on lysine 193 (K193) inducing ΔNp63α stabilization and activating specific transcriptional functions. Furthermore we show that Fibroblast Growth Factor-8 (FGF8), a morphogenetic signaling molecule essential for embryonic limb development, increases the binding of ΔNp63α to the tyrosine kinase c-Abl as well as the levels of ΔNp63α acetylation. Notably, the natural mutant ΔNp63α-K193E, associated to the Split-Hand/Foot Malformation-IV syndrome, cannot be acetylated by this pathway. This mutant ΔNp63α protein displays promoter-specific loss of DNA binding activity and consequent altered expression of development-associated ΔNp63α target genes. Our results link FGF8, c-Abl and p300 in a regulatory pathway that controls ΔNp63α protein stability and transcriptional activity. Hence, limb malformation-causing p63 mutations, such as the K193E mutation, are likely to result in aberrant limb development via the combined action of altered protein stability and altered promoter occupancy.

9724018|t|Functional properties of leptin receptor isoforms containing the gln-->pro extracellular domain mutation of the fatty rat.
9724018|t|Mutations of the leptin receptor have been found to cause obesity in rodents. The fa mutation that is responsible for obesity in Zucker rats is a missense mutation (269 gln-->pro) in the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor. We have characterized the effects of this mutation on the two major isoforms of the leptin receptor, Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra, by studying cell-surface expression, leptin binding affinity, signaling capacity, and receptor-mediated internalization and degradation of leptin in transfected mammalian cell lines. Both Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) and Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) have decreased cell-surface expression and decreased leptin binding affinity. Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) was shown to have defective signaling to the JAK-STAT pathway and markedly diminished ability to activate transcription of the egr-1 promoter. Constitutive ligand-independent activation of Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) was observed for activation of egr-1-luc but only under conditions when JAK2 was coexpressed with Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro), Finally, Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) has an increased ability to internalize leptin but is less efficient at degrading leptin, as compared with Ob-Ra. In conclusion, both Ob-Ra(269 gln-->pro) and Ob-Rb(269 gln-->pro) have multiple functional defects.

10383403|t|Association of atypical protein kinase C isotypes with the docker protein FRS2 in fibroblast growth factor signaling.
10383403|t|FRS2 is a docker protein that recruits signaling proteins to the plasma membrane in fibroblast growth factor signal transduction. We report here that FRS2 was associated with PKC lambda when Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor. PKC zeta, the other member of the atypical PKC subfamily, could also bind FRS2. The association between FRS2 and PKC lambda is likely to be direct as shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The C-terminal fragments of FRS2 (amino acid residues 300-508) and SNT2 (amino acids 281-492), an isoform bearing 50% identity to FRS2, interacted with PKC lambda at a region (amino acids 240-562) that encompasses the catalytic domain. In vitro kinase assays revealed neither FRS2 nor SNT2 was a substrate of PKC lambda or zeta. Mutation of the alanine residue (Ala-120) to glutamate in the pseudo-substrate region of PKC lambda results in a constitutively active kinase that exhibited more than 2-fold greater binding to FRS2 in vitro than its "closed" wild-type counterpart. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 did not affect its binding to the constitutively active PKC lambda mutant, suggesting that the activation of PKC lambda is necessary and sufficient for its association with FRS2. It is likely that FRS2 serves as an anchoring protein for targeting activated atypical PKCs to the cell plasma membrane in signaling pathways.

10995764|t|Signaling complexes and protein-protein interactions involved in the activation of the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways by the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase.
10995764|t|Proximal signaling events and protein-protein interactions initiated after activation of the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), were investigated in cells carrying native and mutated forms of this receptor. Mutation of Tyr-1062 (Y1062F) in the cytoplasmic tail of c-Ret abolished receptor binding and phosphorylation of the adaptor Shc and eliminated activation of Ras by GDNF. Phosphorylation of Erk kinases was also greatly attenuated but not eliminated by this mutation. This residual wave of Erk phosphorylation was independent of the kinase activity of c-Ret. Mutation of Tyr-1096 (Y1096F), a binding site for the adaptor Grb2, had no effect on Erk activation by GDNF. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector Akt was also reduced in the Y1062F mutant but not completely abolished unless Tyr-1096 was also mutated. Ligand stimulation of neuronal cells induced the assembly of a large protein complex containing c-Ret, Grb2, and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Shc, p85(PI3K), the adaptor Gab2, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. In agreement with Ras-independent activation of PI3K by GDNF in neuronal cells, survival of sympathetic neurons induced by GDNF was dependent on PI3K but was not affected by microinjection of blocking anti-Ras antibodies, which did compromise neuronal survival by nerve growth factor, suggesting that Ras is not required for GDNF-induced survival of sympathetic neurons. These results indicate that upon ligand stimulation, at least two distinct protein complexes assemble on phosphorylated Tyr-1062 of c-Ret via Shc, one leading to activation of the Ras/Erk pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Sos and another to the PI3K/Akt pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Gab2 followed by p85(PI3K) and SHP-2. This latter complex can also assemble directly onto phosphorylated Tyr-1096, offering an alternative route to PI3K activation by GDNF.

23658024|t|Mutations in the paxillin-binding site of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) destabilize the pseudokinase domain and cause embryonic lethality in mice.
23658024|t|Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) where it regulates cell spreading, migration, and growth factor receptor signaling. Previous reports showed that overexpressed ILK in which Val(386) and Thr(387) were substituted with glycine residues (ILK-VT/GG) could neither interact with paxillin nor localize to FA in cells expressing endogenous wild-type ILK, implying that paxillin binding to ILK is required for its localization to FAs. Here, we show that introducing this mutation into the germ line of mice (ILK-VT/GG) caused vasculogenesis defects, resulting in a general developmental delay and death at around embryonic day 12.5. Fibroblasts isolated from ILK-VT/GG mice contained mutant ILK in FAs, showed normal adhesion to and spreading on extracellular matrix substrates but displayed impaired migration. Biochemical analysis revealed that VT/GG substitutions decreased ILK protein stability leading to decreased ILK levels and reduced binding to paxillin and α-parvin. Because paxillin depletion did not affect ILK localization to FAs, the embryonic lethality and the in vitro migration defects are likely due to the reduced levels of ILK-VT/GG and diminished binding to parvins.

16141217|t|Cross-talk between the two divergent insulin signaling pathways is revealed by the protein kinase B (Akt)-mediated phosphorylation of adapter protein APS on serine 588.
16141217|t|The APS adapter protein is recruited to the autophosphorylated kinase domain of the insulin receptor and initiates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-independent pathway of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by recruiting CAP and c-Cbl. In this study, we have identified APS as a novel substrate for protein kinase B/Akt using an antibody that exhibits insulin-dependent immunoreactivity with a phosphospecific antibody raised against the protein kinase B substrate consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT) and a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes serine 21/9 of glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha/beta. This phosphorylation of APS is observed in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and transfected cells. The insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS was inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY290004, a specific protein kinase B (PKB) inhibitor, deguelin, and knockdown of Akt. Serine 588 of APS is contained in a protein kinase B consensus sequence for phosphorylation conserved in APS across multiple species but not found in other members of this family, including SH2-B and Lnk. Mutation of serine 588 to alanine abolished the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of APS and prevented the localization of APS to membrane ruffles. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 534-621 of APS was phosphorylated by purified PKB in vitro, and mutation of serine 588 abolished the PKB-mediated phosphorylation of APS in vitro. Taken together, this study identifies APS as a novel physiological substrate for PKB and the first serine phosphorylation site on APS. These data therefore reveal the molecular cross-talk between the insulin-activated PI3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways previously thought to be distinct and divergent.

7824275|t|Intermolecular association and trans-phosphorylation of different neu-kinase forms permit SH2-dependent signaling and oncogenic transformation.
7824275|t|The neu oncogene encodes a 185 kDa receptor tyrosine kinase. A single point mutation (Val664-->Glu) within the p185neu transmembrane region results in higher efficiency of receptor dimerization, constitutive activity of tyrosine kinase and cellular transformation. The oncogenic potential of this mutated form of p185neu (termed Tneu) can be inactivated by site-directed alteration of a lysine residue in the conserved catalytic domain. In this report, we have utilized the physical and functional interaction of a full-length kinase-deficient neu protein (T757) and truncated kinase-active Tneu forms to determine critical protein domains for Tneu oligomerization and the resultant biological consequences. Analysis of various truncated Tneu mutants confirmed that the transmembrane region was crucial for p185 dimerization. Receptor association facilitates intermolecular phosphorylation of kinase-deficient mutant T757 by truncated kinase-active p185 proteins, and the trans-phosphorylated kinase-deficient T757 was able to associate in vitro with proteins containing SH2 domains. Receptor-receptor interactions resulted in enhanced signal transduction potential and transformation of cell-lines co-expressing different neu-kinase forms. These studies emphasize a novel feature of protein-protein interaction and the functional significance of p185 dimerization, intermolecular phosphorylation and signaling which may result in cellular transformation.

9131587|t|A genetic approach to mapping the p53 binding site in the MDM2 protein.
9131587|t|BACKGROUND: The MDM2 oncoprotein binds to the tumor suppressor p53 and inhibits its anti-oncogenic functions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the amino acids of MDM2 that are critical for binding to p53, a modified two-hybrid screen was performed in yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed to identify MDM2 residues important for p53 interaction. Mutant MDM2 proteins were subsequently tested for their ability to bind to p53 in vitro and for their ability to regulate p53-mediated transcription in vivo. RESULTS: The yeast genetic screen yielded two Mdm2 mutations (G58D and C77Y) which disrupted binding to p53 in vitro without altering the conformation of MDM2 as determined with conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis yielded mutations of two additional amino acids of MDM2 (D68 and V75) that prevented binding to p53 in vitro. The mutant MDM2 proteins were unable to inhibit p53-dependent transcription in vivo, which is consistent with prior indications that a physical interaction between the two proteins is required for MDM2's inhibition of p53. Finally, the crystal structure of the MDM2-p53 complex shows that two of the four critical residues identified here contact p53 directly, while the remaining two residues play important structural roles in the MDM2 domain. CONCLUSIONS: MDM2 residues G58, D68, V75, and C77 are critical for MDM2's interaction with the p53 protein. Mutation of these residues to alanine prevents MDM2's interaction with p53 in vitro, and MDM2's regulation of p53's transcriptional activity in vivo.

26679646|t|[14-3-3/HIP-55 complex increases the stability of HIP-55].
26679646|t|OBJECTIVE: To further demonstrate the interaction of a new 14-3-3 interaction protein hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1[HPK1]-interacting protein (HIP-55) and 14-3-3 proteins and its potential biological function in HEK293 cells. METHODS: PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55WT (wild type),PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55AA (mutants, S269A/T291A, abolishing the binding of HIP-55 to 14-3-3),PDEST-GST-HIP-55WT and PDEST-C-Venus-14-3-3τ plasmids were constructed by gateway system. Their expressions were demonstrated by Western blotting method. Then we used Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) methods to demonstrate the interaction of HIP-55 and 14-3-3 in HEK293 cells. Moreover, the 14-3-3 antagonist peptide, R18 and HIP-55 protein mutant plasmid HIP-55AA were used to detect the protein synthesis of HIP-55 at different time points induced by puromycin, an inhibitor of protein production. RESULTS: The HEK293 cells expressed HIP-55 protein respectively, after being transected with PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55WT,PDEST-N-Venus-HIP-55AA,PDEST-GST-HIP-55WT plasmids and expressed 14-3-3 protein after being transected with PDEST-C-Venus-14-3-3τ plasmids. We could detect venus fluorescence of venus-HIP-55 protein via confocal microscopy in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55 and C-14-3-3τ plasmids by BiFC, but not in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55 AA (mutants S269A/T291A) and C-14-3-3τ plasmids. The results of BiFC suggested that 14-3-3 interacted with HIP-55 through HIP-55 S269/T291 sites. At the same time, the data of co-IP showed that there were endogenous interactions between 14-3-3 and HIP-55. Furthermore, puromycin had no influence in HIP-55 protein synthesis at hours 0, 4, or 8 in HEK 293 cells expressing GST-HIP-55WT and 14-3-3 plasmids, while puromycin blocked HIP-55 protein synthesis in HEK 293 cells transfected with N-Venus-HIP-55AA (mutants S269A/T291A) and C-14-3-3τ plasmids. The results indicated that the 14-3-3/HIP-55 complex could contributed to the stability of HIP-55. CONCLUSION: HIP-55 forms a complex with 14-3-3 and 14-3-3/HIP-55 interaction increases the stability of HIP-55.

16156650|t|Specificity determinants on Cdc42 for binding its effector protein ACK.
16156650|t|Cdc42 and Rac are highly homologous members of the Rho family of small G proteins that interact with several downstream effector proteins thereby causing cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell proliferation, and differentiation. While some effectors, such as the tyrosine kinase, ACK, and the scaffold protein, WASP, are unique to Cdc42, others, such as the serine-threonine kinase, PAK, are shared with Rac. Previous mutagenesis studies identified Val42 and Leu174 as residues that selectively affect binding of Cdc42 to ACK and WASP but not to PAK. However, it is unclear whether these discriminatory residues are sufficient determinants of specificity. In this study we sought to introduce "gain-of function" mutations into Rac to allow it to bind to ACK and WASP, thereby revealing all specificity determinants. Thirteen mutations were made changing Rac residues to those in Cdc42. Equilibrium binding constants of all mutant Rac proteins to ACK, WASP, and PAK were measured. A combination of seven mutations (S41A, A42V, N43T, D47G, N52T, W56F, and R174L) was determined to be necessary to change the binding affinity of Rac for ACK from negligible (K(d) < 1 microM) to a comparable affinity to Cdc42 (K(d) 25 nM). These mutations are not confined to interface residues. We interpret these data to indicate the importance of the structure of regions of the protein distinct from the contact residues. None of these mutant Rac proteins bound WASP with a similar affinity to Cdc42. Hence, residues as yet unidentified, outside the interface, must be necessary for binding WASP.

2834865|t|Characterization of the in vitro interaction between SV40 T antigen and p53: mapping the p53 binding site.
2834865|t|An efficient in vitro system for generating soluble complexes between simian virus 40 T antigen and the cellular protein p53 was developed. A p53 cDNA was inserted 3' to the SP6 promoter in pGEM-1 (Promega-Biotec) and transcribed by SP6 polymerase. In vitro translation of the cRNA generated p53 which was immunoprecipitable with all five monoclonal antibodies tested (PAb122, PAb421, PAb242, PAb246, and PAb248). The p53 sedimented at about 8-10 S in sucrose gradients, possibly corresponding to a tetramer. T-antigen-p53 complexes were produced by the addition of immunoaffinity-purified T antigen to p53-containing translation lysates. Equivalent amounts of p53 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-T-antigen antibodies PAb416, PAb419, and PAb101, suggesting that in vitro made p53 complexed mostly to a population of T-antigen molecules that had matured at least 15 min in the cell. The complexes sedimented at 18-20 S in sucrose gradients. In order to map the p53 binding site on T antigen, p53 was complexed in vitro to labeled proteolytic fragments of T antigen. A 46K fragment, spanning residues 131-517, was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p53 monoclonal PAb122 and therefore is likely to contain the p53 binding site. This region contains T-antigen sequences necessary for the efficient transformation of nonpermissive cells and for the induction of cellular rRNA synthesis. It also contains the binding sites for DNA polymerase alpha and ATP. We suggest a possible role for T-p53 complexes in T-antigen-associated functions.

11781841|t|Recruitment of TRRAP required for oncogenic transformation by E1A.
11781841|t|TRRAP links Myc with histone acetylases and appears to be an important mediator of its oncogenic function. Here we show that interaction with TRRAP is required for cellular transformation not only by Myc, but also by the adenovirus E1A protein. Substitution of the 262 N-terminal residues of Myc with a small domain of E1A (residues 12-54) restores Myc transforming function. E1A(12-54) contains a TRRAP-interaction domain, that recruits TRRAP to either E1A-Myc chimeras, or the native 12S E1A protein. Overexpression of a competing TRRAP fragment in vivo blocks interaction of cellular TRRAP with either E1A-Myc or E1A, and suppresses cellular transformation by both oncoproteins. Moreover, E1A(Delta26-35) that fails to bind TRRAP but is capable of binding the Retinoblastoma (Rb)-family and p300/CBP proteins is defective in cellular immortalization, transformation and cell cycle deregulation. Thus in addition to disrupting Rb and p300/CBP functions, E1A must recruit TRRAP to transform cells.

14623899|t|Nutrient-dependent and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 on serine 302 correlates with increased insulin signaling.
14623899|t|Ser/Thr phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 regulates insulin signaling, but the relevant phosphorylated residues and their potential functions during insulin-stimulated signal transduction are difficult to resolve. We used a sequence-specific polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser(302) to study IRS-1-mediated signaling during insulin and insulin-like growth factor IGF-I stimulation. Insulin or IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of Ser(302) in various cell backgrounds and in murine muscle. Wortmannin or rapamycin inhibited Ser(302) phosphorylation, and amino acids or glucose stimulated Ser(302) phosphorylation, suggesting a role for the mTOR cascade. The Ser(302) kinase associates with IRS-1 during immunoprecipitation, but its identity is unknown. The NH(2)-terminal c-Jun kinase did not phosphorylate Ser(302). Replacing Ser(302) with alanine significantly reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p85 binding and reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p70(S6K), ribosomal S6 protein, and 4E-BP1; however, this mutation had no effect on insulin-stimulated Akt or glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation. Replacing Ser(302) with alanine reduced insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis. We conclude that Ser(302) phosphorylation integrates nutrient availability with insulin/IGF-I signaling to promote mitogenesis and cell growth.

9811754|t|Host cell-virus cross talk: phosphorylation of a hepatitis B virus envelope protein mediates intracellular signaling.
9811754|t|Phosphorylation of cytosolic pre-S domains of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) large envelope protein (L) was identified as a regulatory modification involved in intracellular signaling. By using biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of phosphopeptides obtained from metabolically radiolabeled L protein, a single phosphorylation site was identified at serine 118 as part of a PX(S/T)P motif, which is strongly preferred by ERK-type mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). ERK2 specifically phosphorylated L at serine 118 in vitro, and L phosphorylation was inhibited by a coexpressed MAP kinase-specific phosphatase. Furthermore, L phosphorylation and ERK activation were shown to be induced in parallel by various stimuli. Functional analysis with transfected cells showed that DHBV L possesses the ability to activate gene expression in trans and, by using mutations eliminating (S-->A) or mimicking (S-->D) serine phosphorylation, that this function correlates with L phosphorylation. These mutations had, however, no major effects on virus production in cell culture and in vivo, indicating that L phosphorylation and transactivation are not essential for hepadnavirus replication and morphogenesis. Together, these data suggest a role of the L protein in intracellular host-virus cross talk by varying the levels of pre-S phosphorylation in response to the state of the cell.

12149229|t|TEL-JAK2 constitutively activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), stress-activated protein/Jun kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38 signaling pathways.
12149229|t|The ets transcription factor, TEL, undergoes chromosomal rearrangements with the tyrosine kinase JAK2. TEL-JAK2 is constitutively active, confers cell line factor independence, and activates signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), STAT3, and STAT5. Data from bone marrow transplantation models suggest that STAT5 activation does not account for the entire disease phenotype induced by TEL-JAK2. This study examined additional signaling pathways that are activated by TEL-JAK2. TEL-JAK2 expression in Ba/F3 cells results in constitutive association and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Ship-1 and, consequently, recruitment of Grb2 to TEL-JAK2. Direct Grb2 recruitment is also possible because a putative Grb2 binding site, Tyr314, is present on TEL-JAK2(5-19) and TEL-JAK2(5-12). Studies with a TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe mutant support a role for Tyr314 in Grb2 recruitment, because Grb2 association with TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe is significantly reduced. Interestingly, TEL-JAK2(5-19)Tyr314Phe shows reduced Ras activation when compared with TEL-JAK2(4-17), TEL-JAK2(5-12), and TEL-JAK2(5-19). Analysis of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), stress-activated protein/Jun kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38 demonstrates the activation of SAPK/JNK and phosphorylation of p38 by all TEL-JAK2 isoforms. TEL-JAK2(5-12) and TEL-JAK2(5-19) preferentially phosphorylate ERK2, whereas TEL-JAK2(4-17) phosphorylated ERK2 at lower levels. Inhibition studies demonstrated that ERK1/2 activation was necessary for Ba/F3 factor independence mediated by TEL-JAK2(5-19), while inhibition of SAPK/JNK or p38 activity had no effect. Our data reveal the requirement of ERK activation by TEL-JAK2(5-19) in Ba/F3 cells and suggest that TEL-JAK2 leukemogenic potential may be mediated in part through ERK1/2.

20097748|t|The proline-rich N-terminal domain of G18 exhibits a novel G protein regulatory function.
20097748|t|The protein G18 (also known as AGS4 or GPSM3) contains three conserved GoLoco/GPR domains in its central and C-terminal regions that bind to inactive Galpha(i), whereas the N-terminal region has not been previously characterized. We investigated whether this domain might itself regulate G protein activity by assessing the abilities of G18 and mutants thereof to modulate the nucleotide binding and hydrolytic properties of Galpha(i1) and Galpha(o). Surprisingly, in the presence of fluoroaluminate (AlF(4)(-)) both G proteins bound strongly to full-length G18 (G18wt) and to its isolated N-terminal domain (G18DeltaC) but not to its GoLoco region (DeltaNG18). Thus, it appears that its N-terminal domain promotes G18 binding to fluoroaluminate-activated Galpha(i/o). Neither G18wt nor any G18 mutant affected the GTPase activity of Galpha(i1) or Galpha(o). In contrast, complex effects were noted with respect to nucleotide binding. As inferred by the binding of [(35)S]GTPgammaS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) to Galpha(i1), the isolated GoLoco region as expected acted as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, whereas the N-terminal region exhibited a previously unknown guanine nucleotide exchange factor effect on this G protein. On the other hand, the N terminus inhibited [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(o), albeit to a lesser extent than the effect of the GoLoco region on Galpha(i1). Taken together, our results identify the N-terminal region of G18 as a novel G protein-interacting domain that may have distinct regulatory effects within the G(i/o) subfamily, and thus, it could potentially play a role in differentiating signals between these related G proteins.

9200712|t|Interactions of structural C and regulatory N domains of troponin C with repeated sequence motifs in troponin I.
9200712|t|The actomyosin ATPase inhibitory protein troponin I (TnI) plays a central regulatory role in skeletal and cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation through its calcium-dependent interactions with troponin C (TnC) and actin. Previously we have demonstrated the utility of F29W and F105W mutants of TnC for measurement of binding affinities of inhibitory peptide TnI(96-116) to its regulatory N and structural C domains, both in isolation and in the intact TnC molecule [Pearlstone, J. R. & Smillie, L. B. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6932-6940]. This approach is now extended to fragment TnI(96-148). Curve-fitting analyses of fluorescence changes induced in the intact TnC mutants and the isolated N and C domains by increasing [TnI(96-148)] have permitted the assignments of K(D) values (designated K(D,N) and K(D,C)) to the interaction of TnI(96-148) with the N and C domains, respectively, of intact TnC. Taken together with the previous data for TnI(96-116) binding, it can be concluded that, within TnI(96-148), residues 96-116 are primarily responsible for binding to C domain of intact TnC and residues 117-148 to its N domain. Inspection of the available mammalian and avian skeletal muscle TnI amino acid sequences reveals a previously unrecognized conserved motif repeated 3-fold, once in the inhibitory peptide region (approximately residues 101-114; designated alpha) and twice more in the region of residues approximately 121-132 (beta) and approximately 135-146 (gamma). The number and distribution of these motifs have important structural implications for the TnI x C complex. In the beta motif of cardiac TnI, as compared with skeletal, several changes in charged amino acids are suggested as candidates responsible for the greater sensitivity of cardiac Ca2+-regulated actomyosin to acidic pH as in ischemia.

12829704|t|Identification of the p16-Arc subunit of the Arp 2/3 complex as a substrate of MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 by proteomic analysis.
12829704|t|The p38 MAPK pathway regulates multiple neutrophil functional responses via activation of the serine-threonine kinase MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2). To identify substrates of MAPKAPK2 that mediate these responses, a proteomic approach was used in which in vitro phosphorylation of neutrophil lysates by exogenously added active recombinant MAPKAPK2 was followed by protein separation using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Peptide mass fingerprinting of peptides defined by MALDI-MS was then utilized to identify phosphorylated proteins detected by autoradiography. Six candidate substrates were identified, including the p16 subunit of the seven-member Arp2/3 complex (p16-Arc). In vitro studies confirmed that MAPKAPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates the A isoform, but not the B isoform, of p16-Arc with a stoichiometry of 0.6 to 0.7. MAPKAPK2 also phosphorylated p16-Arc in intact Arp2/3 complexes precipitated from neutrophil lysates. Mutation of serine-77 to alanine on the A isoform prevented phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2. The ability of MAPKAPK2 to phosphorylate one isoform of p16-Arc suggests a possible mechanism by which the p38 MAPK cascade regulates remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

8553584|t|Mechanism of interferon action. Biochemical and genetic evidence for the intermolecular association of the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR from human cells.
8553584|t|The interferon-inducible protein kinase (PKR) is activated by an RNA-dependent autophosphorylation. Structure-function studies of the 551 amino acid PKR kinase from human cells have revealed that catalytic-deficient PKR mutants such as PKR(1-551)K296R display a dominant negative behavior when expressed in transfected cells. The potential for PKR to form protein multimers has therefore been examined. Three types of studies, including both genetic and biochemical analyses, demonstrated that PKR from human cells undergoes an intermolecular association that is not dependent upon RNA. First, the intermolecular association of PKR in vitro was demonstrated in the context of an enzyme-substrate interaction. Purified recombinant histidine-tagged PKR(1-551)K296R mutant protein was phosphorylated by purified wild-type PKR; this intermolecular phosphorylation of PKR was dependent on double-stranded RNA. At a fixed RNA concentration, high concentrations of the HIS-PKR(1-551)K296R mutant both impaired the autophosphorylation of wild-type PKR and blocked the trans-phosphorylation of itself. Second, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to probe the intermolecular association of PKR in vivo. Coexpression of the full-length catalytic-deficient phosphotransfer mutant PKR(1-551)K296R as a fusion protein with the Gal4 activation domain and the Gal4 DNA binding domain resulted in the expression of two Gal4-responsive reporter genes, HIS3 and lacZ. The full-length RNA-binding deficient PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R double mutant also interacted with PKR(1-551)K296R sufficiently to activate Gal4-responsive reporter genes; however, other PKR mutants including PKR(1-280)wt and PKR(281-551)K296R as well as p53, RAS, and BCL2 did not. Third, both PKR(1-551)K296R and PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R enhanced the expression of the reovirus S1 gene and S1/S4 chimeric gene in cotransfected COS cells. By contrast, the expression of the reovirus S4 gene was not enhanced by cotransfection with either PKR(1-551)K296R or PKR(1-551)K64E/K296R. These results indicate that PKR interacts with itself in an intermolecular manner both in vivo and in vitro, and that RNA binding is neither necessary nor sufficient for PKR multimerization.

10210183|t|Protein-protein recognition: an experimental and computational study of the R89K mutation in Raf and its effect on Ras binding.
10210183|t|Binding of the protein Raf to the active form of Ras promotes activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, triggering cell growth and differentiation. Raf/Arg89 in the center of the binding interface plays an important role determining Ras-Raf binding affinity. We have investigated experimentally and computationally the Raf-R89K mutation, which abolishes signaling in vivo. The binding to [gamma-35S]GTP-Ras of a fusion protein between the Raf-binding domain (RBD) of Raf and GST was reduced at least 175-fold by the mutation, corresponding to a standard binding free energy decrease of at least 3.0 kcal/mol. To compute this free energy and obtain insights into the microscopic interactions favoring binding, we performed alchemical simulations of the RBD, both complexed to Ras and free in solution, in which residue 89 is gradually mutated from Arg into Lys. The simulations give a standard binding free energy decrease of 2.9+/-1.9 kcal/mol, in agreement with experiment. The use of numerous runs with three different force fields allows insights into the sources of uncertainty in the free energy and its components. The binding decreases partly because of a 7 kcal/mol higher cost to desolvate Lys upon binding, compared to Arg, due to better solvent interactions with the more concentrated Lys charge in the unbound state. This effect is expected to be general, contributing to the lower propensity of Lys to participate in protein-protein interfaces. Large contributions to the free energy change also arise from electrostatic interactions with groups up to 8 A away, namely residues 37-41 in the conserved effector domain of Ras (including 4 kcal/mol from Ser39 which loses a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Arg89), the conserved Lys84 and Lys87 of Raf, and 2-3 specific water molecules. This analysis will provide insights into the large experimental database of Ras-Raf mutations.

11306590|t|Identification of apocalmodulin and Ca2+-calmodulin regulatory domain in skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel, ryanodine receptor.
11306590|t|Fusion proteins and full-length mutants were generated to identify the Ca(2+)-free (apoCaM) and Ca(2+)-bound (CaCaM) calmodulin binding sites of the skeletal muscle Ca(2+) release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1). [(35)S]Calmodulin (CaM) overlays of fusion proteins revealed one potential Ca(2+)-dependent (aa 3553-3662) and one Ca(2+)-independent (aa 4302-4430) CaM binding domain. W3620A or L3624D substitutions almost abolished completely, whereas V3619A or L3624A substitutions reduced [(35)S]CaM binding to fusion protein (aa 3553-3662). Three full-length RyR1 single-site mutants (V3619A,W3620A,L3624D) and one deletion mutant (Delta4274-4535) were generated and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. L3624D exhibited greatly reduced [(35)S]CaM binding affinity as indicated by a lack of noticeable binding of apoCaM and CaCaM (nanomolar) and the requirement of CaCaM (micromolar) for the inhibition of RyR1 activity. W3620A bound CaM (nanomolar) only in the absence of Ca(2+) and did not show inhibition of RyR1 activity by 3 microm CaCaM. V3619A and the deletion mutant bound apoCaM and CaCaM at levels compared with wild type. V3619A activity was inhibited by CaM with IC(50) approximately 200 nm, as compared with IC(50) approximately 50 nm for wild type and the deletion mutant. [(35)S]CaM binding experiments with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles suggested that apoCaM and CaCaM bind to the same region of the native RyR1 channel complex. These results indicate that the intact RyR1 has a single CaM binding domain that is shared by apoCaM and CaCaM.

16760361|t|Mutagenesis within helix 6 of the human beta1-adrenergic receptor identifies Lysine324 as a residue involved in imparting the high-affinity binding state of agonists.
16760361|t|Competition binding isotherms for agonists to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) display high and low binding affinities. Mutagenesis of lysine at position 324 in helix 6 of the wild-type (WT) human beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) generated mutant receptors that had GTP-insensitive single low-affinity binding sites for agonists and reduced potencies of full or partial agonists in stimulating adenylyl cyclase. Unlike the WT beta1-AR, intrinsic activities of full and partial agonists in activating the Lys324-->Ala beta1-AR (K324A) mutant were correlated with their binding affinities to the K324A mutant. In assays, such as agonist-mediated phosphorylation and recycling, the K324A mutant and the WT beta1-AR behaved similarly. However, in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays that determined the proximity between the WT beta1-AR or the K324A mutant to G(s)alpha, there were significant differences. The conceptual framework of the ternary complex model could not adequately account for the behavior of the K324A mutant except under assumptions of low receptor-G protein binding affinities. The single low-affinity binding site of the K324A mutant to isoproterenol was converted by the C-terminal 11-amino-acid peptide of G(s)alpha, which acts a GDP-bound G(s)alpha mimic, to high- and low-affinity sites. Based upon the three-dimensional architecture of the human beta1-AR, the distance between Lys324 and the Asp/Glu-Arg-Tyr motif in helix 3 was the shortest among the various amino acids in helix 6. These findings indicate that Lys324 lies in a groove between helices 3 and 6, and its mutagenesis generates a mutant receptor with very low binding affinity for the GDP-bound isoform of G(s).

12933808|t|CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation regulates SAP97/NR2A interaction.
12933808|t|Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97), a member of membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein family, has been implicated in the processes of targeting ionotropic glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites. Here we show that SAP97 is enriched at the postsynaptic density where it co-localizes with both ionotropic glutamate receptors and downstream signaling proteins such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). SAP97 and alphaCaMKII display a high co-localization pattern in hippocampal neurons as well as in transfected COS-7 cells. Metabolic labeling of hippocampal cultures reveals that N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activation induces CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97; co-incubation with the CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 reduces SAP97 phosphorylation to basal levels. Our results show that SAP97 directly interacts with the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptor both in an in vitro "pull-out" assay and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments from homogenates and synaptosomes purified from hippocampal rat tissue. Interestingly, in the postsynaptic density fraction, SAP97 fails to co-precipitate with NR2A. We show here that SAP97 is directly associated with NR2A through its PDZ1 domain, and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-232 disrupts NR2A interaction both in an in vitro pull-out assay and in transfected COS-7 cells. Moreover, expression of SAP97(S232D) mutant has effects similar to those observed upon constitutively activating CaMKII. Our findings suggest that SAP97/NR2A interaction is regulated by CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation and provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic targeting of NMDA receptor subunits.

27339457|t|Functional consequence of fibulin-4 missense mutations associated with vascular and skeletal abnormalities and cutis laxa.
27339457|t|Fibulin-4 is a 60kDa calcium binding glycoprotein that has an important role in development and integrity of extracellular matrices. It interacts with elastin, fibrillin-1 and collagen IV as well as with lysyl oxidases and is involved in elastogenesis and cross-link formation. To date, several mutations in the fibulin-4 gene (FBLN4/EFEMP2) are known in patients whose major symptoms are vascular deformities, aneurysm, cutis laxa, joint laxity, or arachnodactyly. The pathogenetic mechanisms how these mutations translate into the clinical phenotype are, however, poorly understood. In order to elucidate these mechanisms, we expressed fibulin-4 mutants recombinantly in HEK293 cells, purified the proteins in native forms and analyzed alterations in protein synthesis, secretion, matrix assembly, and interaction with other proteins in relation to wild type fibulin-4. Our studies show that different mutations affect these properties in multiple ways, resulting in fibulin-4 deficiency and/or impaired ability to form elastic fibers. The substitutions E126K and C267Y impaired secretion of the protein, but not mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the E126K mutant showed less resistance to proteases, reduced binding to collagen IV and fibrillin-1, as well as to LTBP1s and LTBP4s. The A397T mutation introduced an extra O-glycosylation site and deleted binding to LTBP1s. We show that fibulin-4 binds stronger than fibulin-3 and -5 to LTBP1s, 3, and 4s, and to the lysyl oxidases LOX and LOXL1; the binding of fibulin-4 to the LOX propeptide was strongly reduced by the mutation E57K. These findings show that different mutations in the fibulin-4 gene result in different molecular defects affecting secretion rates, protein stability, LOX-induced cross-linking, or binding to other ECM components and molecules of the TGF-β pathway, and thus illustrate the complex role of fibulin-4 in connective tissue assembly.

Here we report that RTKs can directly modulate the function of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) through post-translational modification. In vitro kinase assays revealed that both the epidermal growth factor and platelet derived growth factor receptors (EGFR and PDGFR, respectively) tyrosine phosphorylate PKA-C. Mass spectrometry identified tyrosine 330 (Y330) as a receptor-mediated phosphorylation site and mutation of Y330 to phenylalanine (Y330F) all but abolished the RTK-mediated phosphorylation of PKA-C in vitro. Y330 resides within a conserved region at the C-terminal tail of PKA-C that allosterically regulates enzymatic activity. Therefore, the effect of phosphorylation at Y330 on the activity of PKA-C was investigated. The K(m) for a peptide substrate was markedly decreased when PKA-C subunits were tyrosine phosphorylated by the receptors as compared to un-phosphorylated controls. Importantly, tyrosine-phosphorylated PKA-C subunits were detected in cells stimulated with EGF, PDGF, and Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and in fibroblasts undergoing PDGF-mediated chemotaxis. These results demonstrate a direct, functional interaction between RTKs and PKA-C and identify tyrosine phosphorylation as a novel mechanism for regulating PKA activity.

9425086|t|Binding of purified 14-3-3 zeta signaling protein to discrete amino acid sequences within the cytoplasmic domain of the platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex.
9425086|t|The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex constitutively expressed on the platelet plasma membrane mediates initial adhesion of circulating platelets to vessel wall matrix at high shear, and shear-induced platelet aggregation. In both cases, this involves binding of GP Ib-IX-V to the adhesive glycoprotein, von Willebrand Factor (vWF). vWF binding to GP Ib-IX-V rapidly induces platelet activation, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, shape change, and secretion that enables alphaIIbbeta3 integrin (GP IIb-IIIa)-dependent platelet aggregation. All these events are critical in (patho)physiological thrombus formation. The recent discovery that the signaling protein, 14-3-3 zeta, copurifies with the GP Ib-IX complex (minus GP V) [Du, X., Harris, S. J., Tetaz, T. J., Ginsberg, M. H., & Berndt, M. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18287-18290] indicated a potential mechanism for vWF-dependent signaling. The aim of the present study was to identify discrete amino acid sequences that bind 14-3-3 zeta within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. As an initial screening assay, overlapping synthetic peptides based on the cytoplasmic domains of GP Ibalpha (100 residues), GP Ibbeta (34 residues), GP IX (5 residues), and GP V (16 residues) were immobilized and assessed for the ability to bind purified 14-3-3 zeta. The C-terminal sequence GHSL of GP Ibalpha was identified as one 14-3-3 zeta interactive sequence, consistent with previous results [Du, X., Fox, J. E., & Pei, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7362-7367]. Binding of 125I-labeled 14-3-3 zeta to GHSL-containing peptides was inhibitable by unlabeled 14-3-3 zeta and by anti-14-3-3 zeta IgG. Ala-walking through the GHSL sequence suggested all residues were necessary for optimal binding. In addition, 14-3-3 zeta bound with lower affinity to a peptide based on the central region of the GP Ibalpha cytoplasmic domain (Arg-557-Gly-575), whereas peptide sequences within the cytoplasmic domains of GP Ibbeta (Arg-160-Arg-175) and GP V (Lys-529-Gly-544) bound 14-3-3 zeta with comparable affinity to the GHSL-containing peptide. Soluble GHSL-containing peptides, GP Ibbeta- and GP V-based peptides semidissociated 14-3-3 zeta from GP Ib-IX-V or GP Ib-IX in platelet extracts as analyzed by immunoprecipitation, suggesting these sequences, at least partially, mediate the GP Ib-IX-V-14-3-3 zeta interaction in cells. Further, phosphorylation of the GP Ibbeta peptide at a site corresponding to a protein kinase A phosphorylation site (Ser-166) enhanced the affinity of 14-3-3 zeta binding by approximately 8-fold, suggesting phosphorylation as a potential mechanism for regulating 14-3-3 zeta association with the GP Ib-IX-V complex.

15703304|t|Characterization of inhibitory signaling motifs of the natural killer cell receptor Siglec-7: attenuated recruitment of phosphatases by the receptor is attributed to two amino acids in the motifs.
15703304|t|Siglec-7 (p75/AIRM1) is an inhibitory receptor on human natural killer cells (NK cells) and monocytes. The cytoplasmic domain of Siglec-7 contains two signaling motifs: a membrane-proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (Ile435-Gln-Tyr-Ala-Pro-Leu440) and a membrane-distal motif (Asn458-Glu-Tyr-Ser-Glu-Ile463). We report here that, upon pervanadate (PV) treatment, Siglec-7 recruited the protein tyrosine phosphatases Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and SHP-2 less efficiently than did other inhibitory receptors such as Siglec-9 and leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor (LAIR-1). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the two Siglecs revealed only three amino acids difference in these motifs. To identify the amino acid(s) critical to recruitment efficiency, we prepared a series of Siglec-7-based mutants in which each of the three amino acids were replaced with the corresponding one of Siglec-9 (I435L, P439S, and N458T mutants). P439S and N458T mutants showed pronounced enhancement of SHP recruitment, but I435L mutant had little effect. A double mutant (P439S, N458T) or triple mutant (I435L, P439S, N458T) recruited SHPs as much as did Siglec-9, indicating that Pro439 in the proximal motif and Asn458 in the distal motif of Siglec-7 attenuate its ability to recruit phosphatases. These amino acids appeared to affect not only phosphatase recruitment but also the subsequent attenuation of Syk phosphorylation.

17938171|t|A suppressive role of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cellular apoptosis mediated by the death-associated protein Daxx.
17938171|t|The death-associated protein Daxx is a multifunctional factor that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including transcription and apoptosis. Several previous reports have indicated that Daxx is induced upon oxidative stress and is then subjected to phosphorylation-based functional modification. However, the precise molecular events underlying these phosphorylation events remain largely unknown. We report in our current study that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is highly overexpressed in malignant human gliomas and inhibits Daxx-mediated cellular apoptosis. The targeted inhibition of Pin1 by small interfering RNA in A172 glioblastoma cells significantly enhances the apoptotic response induced by hydrogen peroxide or stimulatory Fas antibodies. This is in turn accompanied by the increased induction of Daxx and the activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Furthermore, Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated Ser178-Pro motif in the Daxx protein, and Pin1 overexpression results in the rapid degradation of Daxx via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, a Daxx-S178A mutant, which cannot interact with Pin1, demonstrates higher proapoptotic activity and is refractory to Pin1-mediated antiapoptotic effects. We further found that the expression levels of Pin1 inversely correlate with the degree of Daxx nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma tissues. These results together indicate that Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization plays an important role in the negative regulation of Daxx and thereby inhibits the oxidative stress-induced cellular apoptotic response, particularly in malignant tumor cells where Pin1 is often overexpressed.

15590636|t|Human insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) polymorphism G972R causes IRS-1 to associate with the insulin receptor and inhibit receptor autophosphorylation.
15590636|t|The most commonly detected polymorphism in human insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a glycine to arginine change at codon 972 (G972R), is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. To determine the molecular mechanism by which this polymorphism may be linked to insulin resistance, we produced recombinant peptides comprising amino acid residues 925-1008 from IRS-1 that contain either a glycine or arginine at codon 972 and the two nearby tyrosine phosphorylation consensus sites (EY(941)MLM and DY(989)MTM), which are known binding sites for the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The wild type peptide could be phosphorylated at these sites in vitro by purified insulin receptor. Introduction of the G972R polymorphism into the peptide reduced the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation by >60%. Pull-down experiments indicated that there was an association between the IRS-1-(925-1008) peptide and the insulin receptor that was markedly enhanced by the presence of the G972R polymorphism. The use of additional overlapping fragments localized this interaction to domains between residues 950-986 of IRS-1 and residues 966-1271 of the insulin receptor, containing the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. In addition, the IRS-1-(925-1008) G972R peptide acted as a competitive inhibitor of insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor autophosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that the G972R naturally occurring polymorphism of IRS-1 not only reduces phosphorylation of the substrate but allows IRS-1 to act as an inhibitor of the insulin receptor kinase, producing global insulin resistance.

16969499|t|Missense mutations of BRCA1 gene affect the binding with p53 both in vitro and in vivo.
16969499|t|Women with BRCA1 gene mutations have an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer (BOC). Classification of missense variants as neutral or disease causing is still a challenge and has major implications for genetic counseling. BRCA1 is organized in an N-terminal ring-finger domain and two BRCT (breast cancer C-terminus) domains, involved in protein-protein interaction. The integrity of the C-terminal, BRCT repeat region is also critical for BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. Several molecular partners of BRCA1 have so far been identified; among them, the tumor suppressor protein p53 seems to play a major role. This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of two missense mutations, namely the W1837R and the S1841N, previously identified in BOC patients and located in the BRCT domain of the BRCA1 gene, on the binding capacity of this protein to p53. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of E. coli-expressed wild-type and mutated BRCTs challenged with a HeLa cell extract revealed, for the S1841N variant a significant reduction in the binding activity to p53, while the W1837R mutant showed an inverse effect. Furthermore, a clonogenic soft agar growth assay performed on HeLa cells stably transfected with either wild-type or mutant BRCA1 showed a marked decrease of the growth in wild-type BRCA1-overexpressing cells and in BRCA1S1841N-transfected cells, while no significant changes were detected in the BRCA1W1837R-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that: i) distinct single nucleotide changes in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 affect binding of this protein to the tumor suppressor p53, and ii) the two missense mutations here described are likely to play a role in breast tumorigenesis. We suggest that in vitro/in vivo experiments testing the effects of unclassified BRCA1 gene variants should therefore be taken in to consideration and that increased surveillance should be adopted in individuals bearing these two BRCA1 missense alterations.

24681347|t|KCNE2 modulates cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel.
24681347|t|KCNE2 plays an important role in maintaining cardiac electrical stability. Mutations in KCNE2 have been linked to long-QT syndrome (LQT6) and atrial fibrillation/short QT syndrome. It has been suggested that KCNE2 has the most promiscuity of function which can interact with multiple-subunits of voltage-dependent cation channels and modulate their functions. However, whether KCNE2 regulates voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2)(+) channel (LCC) remains unknown. This study investigated the possible role of KCNE2 in regulating cardiac LCCs and the pathophysiological relevance of this regulation. We found that overexpression of KCNE2 in Sprague-Dawley rat cardiomyocytes decreased L-type Ca(2+)current (ICa,L), whereas KCNE2 knockdown by RNA interference increased ICa,L. Upregulation of KCNE2 caused a slight positive shift of the voltage-dependent activation and a negative shift of the steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation, and slowed the recovery from inactivation of ICa,L, while knockdown of KCNE2 had the contrary effects. Similar regulation of ICa,L magnitude had been observed in transfected HEK 293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization assays in both cardiomyocytes and the transfected cell line suggest that Cav1.2 physically interacted with KCNE2. Deletion of the N-terminal inhibitory module (NTI) of Cav1.2 results in the large loss of KCNE2 regulation of ICa,L and interaction with Cav1.2. Furthermore, we found that the familial atrial fibrillation related KCNE2 mutation R27C enhanced the effect of KCNE2 on suppressing ICa,L. Taken together, our findings indicate that KCNE2 modulates ICa,L by regulating NTI function of Cav1.2. The KCNE2 mutation R27C may induce familial atrial fibrillation partially through enhancing the suppression of ICa,L.

19789182|t|Tyrosine phosphorylation of nuclear-membrane protein emerin by Src, Abl and other kinases.
19789182|t|X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is caused by loss of emerin, a nuclear-membrane protein with roles in nuclear architecture, gene regulation and signaling. Phosphoproteomic studies have identified 13 sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in emerin. We validated one study, confirming that emerin is hyper-tyrosine-phosphorylated in Her2-overexpressing cells. We discovered that non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src and Abl each phosphorylate emerin and a related protein, LAP2beta, directly. Src phosphorylated emerin specifically at Y59, Y74 and Y95; the corresponding triple Y-to-F (;FFF') mutation reduced tyrosine phosphorylation by approximately 70% in vitro and in vivo. Substitutions that removed a single hydroxyl moiety either decreased (Y19F, Y34, Y161F) or increased (Y4F) emerin binding to BAF in cells. Y19F, Y34F, Y161F and the FFF mutant also reduced recombinant emerin binding to BAF from HeLa lysates, demonstrating the involvement of both LEM-domain and distal phosphorylatable tyrosines in binding BAF. We conclude that emerin function is regulated by multiple tyrosine kinases, including Her2, Src and Abl, two of which (Her2, Src) regulate striated muscle. These findings suggest roles for emerin as a downstream effector and ;signal integrator' for tyrosine kinase signaling pathway(s) at the nuclear envelope.

11514541|t|A direct interaction between oncogenic Ha-Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is not required for Ha-Ras-dependent transformation of epithelial cells.
11514541|t|Cells expressing oncogenic Ras proteins transmit a complex set of signals that ultimately result in constitutive activation of signaling molecules, culminating in unregulated cellular function. Although the role of oncogenic Ras in a variety of cellular responses including transformation, cell survival, differentiation, and migration is well documented, the direct Ras/effector interactions that contribute to the different Ras biological end points have not been as clearly defined. Observations by other groups in which Ras-dependent transformation can be blocked by expression of either dominant negative forms of Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase or PTEN, a 3-phosphoinositide-specific phosphatase, support an essential role for PI 3-kinase and its lipid products in the transformation process. These observations coupled with the in vitro observations that the catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinase, the p110 isoforms, bind directly to Ras-GTP foster the implication that a direct interaction between an oncogenic Ras protein and PI 3-kinase are causal in the oncogenicity of mutant Ras proteins. Using an activated Ha-Ras protein (Y64G/Y71G/F156L) that fails to interact with PI 3-kinase, we demonstrate that oncogenic Ha-Ras does not require a direct interaction with PI 3-kinase to support anchorage-independent growth of IEC-6 epithelial cells. We do find, however, that IEC-6 cells expressing an oncogenic Ha-Ras protein that no longer binds PI 3-kinase are greatly impaired in their ability to migrate toward fibronectin.

10391677|t|SHP-2 binds to Tyr763 and Tyr1009 in the PDGF beta-receptor and mediates PDGF-induced activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and chemotaxis.
10391677|t|Activation of the beta-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by its ligand leads to autophosphorylation on a number of tyrosine residues. Here we show that Tyr763 in the kinase insert region is a novel autophosphorylation site, which after phosphorylation binds the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 has also previously been shown to bind to phosphorylated Tyr1009 in the PDGF beta-receptor. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells transfected with a PDGF beta-receptor in which Tyr763 and Tyr1009 were mutated to phenylalanine residues failed to associate with SHP-2 after ligand stimulation. Moreover, PDGF-BB-induced Ras GTP-loading and Erk2 activation were severely compromised in the receptor mutant. Whereas the mitogenic response to PDGF-BB remained at the same level as in cells expressing wild-type PDGF beta-receptor, chemotaxis induced by PDGF-BB was significantly decreased in the case of the Y763F/Y1009F mutant cells, suggesting an important role for SHP-2 in chemotactic signaling.

24713462|t|A590T mutation in KCNQ1 C-terminal helix D decreases IKs channel trafficking and function but not Yotiao interaction.
24713462|t|KCNQ1 encodes the α subunit of the voltage-gated channel that mediates the cardiac slow delayed rectifier K(+) current (IKs). Here, we report a KCNQ1 allele encoding an A590T mutation [KCNQ1(A590T)] found in a 39-year-old female with a mild QT prolongation. A590 is located in the C-terminal α helical region of KCNQ1 that mediates subunit tetramerization, membrane trafficking, and interaction with Yotiao. This interaction is known to be required for the proper modulation of IKs by cAMP. Since previous studies reported that mutations in the vicinity of A590 impair IKs channel surface expression and function, we examined whether and how the A590T mutation affects the IKs channel. Electrophysiological measurements in HEK-293T cells showed that the A590T mutation caused a reduction in IKs density and a right-shift of the current-voltage relation of channel activation. Immunocytochemical and immunoblot analyses showed the reduced cell surface expression of KCNQ1(A590T) subunit and its rescue by coexpression of the wild-type KCNQ1 [KCNQ1(WT)] subunit. Moreover, KCNQ1(A590T) subunit interacted with Yotiao and had a cAMP-responsiveness comparable to that of KCNQ1(WT) subunit. These findings indicate that the A590 of KCNQ1 subunit plays important roles in the maintenance of channel surface expression and function via a novel mechanism independent of interaction with Yotiao.

10581258|t|Phosphorylation of human p53 by p38 kinase coordinates N-terminal phosphorylation and apoptosis in response to UV radiation.
10581258|t|Components of the ras signaling pathway contribute to activation of cellular p53. In MCF-7 cells, p38 kinase activated p53 more effectively than other members of the ras pathway. p53 and p38 kinase exist in the same physical complex, and co-expression of p38 stabilized p53 protein. In vitro, p38 kinase phosphorylated p53 at Ser33 and Ser46, a newly identified site. Mutation of these sites decreased p53-mediated and UV-induced apoptosis, and the reduction correlated with total abrogation of UV-induced phosphorylation on Ser37 and a significant decrease in Ser15 phosphorylation in mutant p53 containing alanine at Ser33 and Ser46. Inhibition of p38 activation after UV irradiation decreased phosphorylation of Ser33, Ser37 and Ser15, and also markedly reduced UV-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These results suggest that p38 kinase plays a prominent role in an integrated regulation of N-terminal phosphorylation that regulates p53-mediated apoptosis after UV radiation.

10454553|t|The strength of interaction at the Raf cysteine-rich domain is a critical determinant of response of Raf to Ras family small GTPases.
10454553|t|To be fully activated at the plasma membrane, Raf-1 must establish two distinct modes of interactions with Ras, one through its Ras-binding domain and the other through its cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The Ras homologue Rap1A is incapable of activating Raf-1 and even antagonizes Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. We proposed previously that this property of Rap1A may be attributable to its greatly enhanced interaction with Raf-1 CRD compared to Ras. On the other hand, B-Raf, another Raf family member, is activatable by both Ras and Rap1A. When interactions with Ras and Rap1A were measured, B-Raf CRD did not exhibit the enhanced interaction with Rap1A, suggesting that the strength of interaction at CRDs may account for the differential action of Rap1A on Raf-1 and B-Raf. The importance of the interaction at the CRD is further supported by a domain-shuffling experiment between Raf-1 and B-Raf, which clearly indicated that the nature of CRD determines the specificity of response to Rap1A: Raf-1, whose CRD is replaced by B-Raf CRD, became activatable by Rap1A, whereas B-Raf, whose CRD is replaced by Raf-1 CRD, lost its response to Rap1A. Finally, a B-Raf CRD mutant whose interaction with Rap1A is selectively enhanced was isolated and found to possess the double mutation K252E/M278T. B-Raf carrying this mutation was not activated by Rap1A but retained its response to Ras. These results indicate that the strength of interaction with Ras and Rap1A at its CRD may be a critical determinant of regulation of the Raf kinase activity by the Ras family small GTPases.

24114843|t|Different Raf protein kinases mediate different signaling pathways to stimulate E3 ligase RFFL gene expression in cell migration regulation.
24114843|t|We previously characterized a Gα12-specific signaling pathway that stimulates the transcription of the E3 ligase RFFL via the protein kinase ARAF and ERK. This pathway leads to persistent PKC activation and is important for sustaining fibroblast migration. However, questions remain regarding how Gα12 specifically activates ARAF, which transcription factor is involved in Gα12-mediated RFFL expression, and whether RFFL is important for cell migration stimulated by other signaling mechanisms that can activate ERK. In this study, we show that replacement of the Gα12 residue Arg-264 with Gln, which is the corresponding Gα13 residue, abrogates the ability of Gα12 to interact with or activate ARAF. We also show that Gα12 can no longer interact with and activate an ARAF mutant with its C-terminal sequence downstream of the kinase domain being replaced with the corresponding CRAF sequence. These results explain why Gα12, but not Gα13, specifically activates ARAF but not CRAF. Together with our finding that recombinant Gα12 is sufficient for stimulating the kinase activity of ARAF, this study reveals an ARAF activation mechanism that is different from that of CRAF. In addition, we show that this Gα12-ARAF-ERK pathway stimulates RFFL transcription through the transcription factor c-Myc. We further demonstrate that EGF, which signals through CRAF, and an activated BRAF mutant also activate PKC and stimulate cell migration through up-regulating RFFL expression. Thus, RFFL-mediated PKC activation has a broad significance in cell migration regulation.

11886851|t|Interaction of elongation factor-1alpha and pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase C-gamma 1 with activating its activity.
11886851|t|The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is a small motif for membrane targeting in the signaling molecules. Phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma1 has two putative PH domains, an NH(2)-terminal and a split PH domain. Here we report studies on the interaction of the PH domain of PLC-gamma1 with translational elongation factor (EF)-1alpha, which has been shown to be a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activator. By pull-down of cell extract with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with various domains of PLC-gamma1 followed by peptide sequence analysis, we identified EF-1alpha as a binding partner of a split PH domain of PLC-gamma1. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis of the PH domain revealed that the beta2-sheet of a split PH domain is critical for the interaction with EF-1alpha. Moreover, Dot-blot assay shows that a split PH domain specifically binds to phosphoinositides including phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). So the PH domain of PLC-gamma1 binds to both EF-1alpha and PIP(2). The binding affinity of EF-1alpha to the GST.PH domain fusion protein increased in the presence of PIP(2), although PIP(2) does not bind to EF-1alpha directly. This suggests that EF-1alpha may control the binding affinity between the PH domain and PIP(2). PLC-gamma1 is substantially activated in the presence of EF-1alpha with a bell-shaped curve in relation to the molar ratio between them, whereas a double point mutant PLC-gamma1 (Y509A/F510A) that lost its binding affinity to EF-1alpha shows basal level activity. Taken together, our data show that EF-1alpha plays a direct role in phosphoinositide metabolism of cellular signaling by regulating PLC-gamma1 activity via a split PH domain.

Multiple abnormalities in the central nervous system (CNS) and axial skeleton have also been observed in mice bearing a Zic3 null allele, mice with a Zic3 overexpression allele, and the majority of patients carrying ZIC3 mutations. Previous studies indicate that ZIC3 protein can bind to the GLI consensus binding site (GLIBS) and physically interact with GLI3, a transcription factor involved in multiple aspects of neural and skeletal development. We investigated in vitro interactions of ZIC3 with GLI3 and the effect of ZIC3 mutations identified in patients with either heterotaxy or isolated cardiovascular malformations. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that all five intact zinc finger (ZF) domains were necessary for binding of ZIC3 to GLIBS. Inclusion of GLIBS upstream of a basal TK promoter had no effect on the activation of the promoter by ZIC3 alone, but it enhanced the synergistic activation of ZIC3 and GLI3. Wild-type (WT) ZIC3 showed specific binding to GLI3 in GST-pull-down assays. Nonsense and frameshift ZIC3 mutants lacking one or more of the zinc finger domains did not physically interact with GST-GLI3; however, two missense mutants c.1213A>G (p.K405E, fifth ZF domain), and c.649C>G (p.P217A, conserved N-terminal domain) retained binding. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that both p.P217A and p.K405E mutants also retained coactivation with GLI3 of reporter gene expression activity, while all the GLI3-nonbinding ZIC3 mutants lacked this activity. Interestingly, no CNS or skeletal abnormalities were observed in patients bearing the p.P217A or p.K405E mutations.

25411383|t|Dantrolene rescues aberrant N-terminus intersubunit interactions in mutant pro-arrhythmic cardiac ryanodine receptors.
25411383|t|AIMS: The ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an intracellular Ca(2+) release channel essential for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Abnormal RyR2 channel function results in the generation of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanistic basis of RyR2 dysfunction in inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present several lines of complementary evidence, indicating that the arrhythmia-associated L433P mutation disrupts RyR2 N-terminus self-association. A combination of yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical cross-linking assays collectively demonstrate that a RyR2 N-terminal fragment carrying the L433P mutation displays substantially reduced self-interaction compared with wild type. Moreover, sucrose density gradient centrifugation reveals that the L433P mutation impairs tetramerization of the full-length channel. [(3)H]Ryanodine-binding assays demonstrate that disrupted N-terminal intersubunit interactions within RyR2(L433P) confer an altered sensitivity to Ca(2+) activation. Calcium imaging of RyR2(L433P)-expressing cells reveals substantially prolonged Ca(2+) transients and reduced Ca(2+) store content indicating defective channel closure. Importantly, dantrolene treatment reverses the L433P mutation-induced impairment and restores channel function. CONCLUSION: The N-terminus domain constitutes an important structural determinant for the functional oligomerization of RyR2. Our findings are consistent with defective N-terminus self-association as a molecular mechanism underlying RyR2 channel deregulation in inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Significantly, the therapeutic action of dantrolene may occur via the restoration of normal RyR2 N-terminal intersubunit interactions.

9891036|t|Phosphorylation of human estrogen receptor alpha by protein kinase A regulates dimerization.
9891036|t|Phosphorylation provides an important mechanism by which transcription factor activity is regulated. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is phosphorylated on multiple sites, and stimulation of a number of growth factor receptors and/or protein kinases leads to ligand-independent and/or synergistic increase in transcriptional activation by ERalpha in the presence of estrogen. Here we show that ERalpha is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) on serine-236 within the DNA binding domain. Mutation of serine-236 to glutamic acid prevents DNA binding by inhibiting dimerization by ERalpha, whereas mutation to alanine has little effect on DNA binding or dimerization. Furthermore, PKA overexpression or activation of endogenous PKA inhibits dimerization in the absence of ligand. This inhibition is overcome by the addition of 17beta-estradiol or the partial agonist 4-hydroxy tamoxifen. Interestingly, treatment with the complete antagonist ICI 182,780 does not overcome the inhibitory effect of PKA activation. Our results indicate that in the absence of ligand ERalpha forms dimers through interaction between DNA binding domains and that dimerization mediated by the ligand binding domain only occurs upon ligand binding but that the complete antagonist ICI 182,780 prevents dimerization through the ligand-binding domain. Heterodimer formation between ERalpha and ERbeta is similarly affected by PKA phosphorylation of serine 236 of ERalpha. However, 4-hydroxytamoxifen is unable to overcome inhibition of dimerization by PKA. Thus, phosphorylation of ERalpha in the DNA binding domain provides a mechanism by which dimerization and thereby DNA binding by the estrogen receptor is regulated.

8798701|t|Characterization of histidine residues essential for receptor binding and activity of nerve growth factor.
8798701|t|The role of the four histidine residues in receptor binding and activity of mouse nerve growth factor (NGF) was investigated using both site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate. Replacement of His-75 or His-84 with alanine resulted in decreased biological activity and decreased affinity for p140(trkA); however, with H75A only, a 5-fold increased affinity toward p75(LANR) was observed. The effect of simultaneous replacement of both His-75 and His-84 was neither additive nor synergistic. Slight perturbations in circular dichroism spectra and weakened self-association of the mutants indicated that His-75 and His-84 may be involved in stability, dimerization, and/or folding of NGF. Diethyl pyrocarbonate modification of His-4 and His-8 in the H75A/H84Q double mutant abolished neuritogenesis, binding to both receptors, and phosphorylation of p140(trkA) in PC12 cells. These chemical and mutational results confirm and clarify previous evidence for the involvement of His-75 and His-84 (Dunbar, J. C., Tregear, G. W., and Bradshaw, R. A. (1984) J. Protein Chem. 3, 349-356) or His-4 and His-8 (Shih, A., Laramee, G. R., Schmelzer, C. H., Burton, L. E., and Winslow, J. W. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 27679-27686) in receptor binding of NGF. At least three and possibly all four histidines, which are located in three spatially distinct regions, contribute to maintenance of functional sites that are essential for receptor binding and activity of NGF.

23640887|t|Activation of asparaginyl endopeptidase leads to Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer disease.
23640887|t|Neurofibrillary pathology of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau is a key lesion of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, and its density in the brain directly correlates with dementia. The phosphorylation of Tau is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A, which in turn is regulated by inhibitor 2, I2(PP2A). In acidic conditions such as generated by brain ischemia and hypoxia, especially in association with hyperglycemia as in diabetes, I2(PP2A) is cleaved by asparaginyl endopeptidase at Asn-175 into the N-terminal fragment (I2NTF) and the C-terminal fragment (I2CTF). Both I2NTF and I2CTF are known to bind to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and inhibit its activity. Here we show that the level of activated asparaginyl endopeptidase is significantly increased, and this enzyme and I2(PP2A) translocate, respectively, from neuronal lysosomes and nucleus to the cytoplasm where they interact and are associated with hyperphosphorylated Tau in Alzheimer disease brain. Asparaginyl endopeptidase from Alzheimer disease brain could cleave GST-I2(PP2A), except when I2(PP2A) was mutated at the cleavage site Asn-175 to Gln. Finally, an induction of acidosis by treatment with kainic acid or pH 6.0 medium activated asparaginyl endopeptidase and consequently produced the cleavage of I2(PP2A), inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and the knockdown of asparaginyl endopeptidase with siRNA abolished this pathway in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggest the involvement of brain acidosis in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and asparaginyl endopeptidase-I2(PP2A)-protein phosphatase 2A-Tau hyperphosphorylation pathway as a therapeutic target.

27601274|t|G-actin guides p53 nuclear transport: potential contribution of monomeric actin in altered localization of mutant p53.
27601274|t|p53 preserves genomic integrity by restricting anomaly at the gene level. Till date, limited information is available for cytosol to nuclear shuttling of p53; except microtubule-based trafficking route, which utilizes minus-end directed motor dynein. The present study suggests that monomeric actin (G-actin) guides p53 traffic towards the nucleus. Histidine-tag pull-down assay using purified p53(1-393)-His and G-actin confirms direct physical association between p53 and monomeric G-actin. Co-immunoprecipitation data supports the same. Confocal imaging explores intense perinuclear colocalization between p53 and G-actin. To address atomistic details of the complex, constraint-based docked model of p53:G-actin complex was generated based on crystal structures. MD simulation reveals that p53 DNA-binding domain arrests very well the G-actin protein. Docking benchmark studies have been carried out for a known crystal structure, 1YCS (complex between p53DBD and BP2), which validates the docking protocol we adopted. Co-immunoprecipitation study using "hot-spot" p53 mutants suggested reduced G-actin association with cancer-associated p53 conformational mutants (R175H and R249S). Considering these findings, we hypothesized that point mutation in p53 structure, which diminishes p53:G-actin complexation results in mutant p53 altered subcellular localization. Our model suggests p53Arg249 form polar-contact with Arg357 of G-actin, which upon mutation, destabilizes p53:G-actin interaction and results in cytoplasmic retention of p53R249S.

11923476|t|Variant amino acids in the extracellular loops of murine and human vasopressin V2 receptors account for differences in cell surface expression and ligand affinity.
11923476|t|Cloning and sequencing of the murine chromosomal region XB harboring the murine vasopressin V(2) receptor (mV(2)R) gene and comparison with the orthologous human Xq28 region harboring the human vasopressin V(2) receptor (hV(2)R) revealed conservation of the genomic organization and a high degree of sequence identity in the V(2)R coding regions. Despite an identity of 87% of the amino acid sequences, both receptors show marked functional differences upon stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells: the mV(2)R displayed a 5-fold higher affinity for [(3)H]AVP than the human ortholog; similar differences were found for the AVP-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Saturation binding experiments with transiently transfected intact COS.M6 cells showed that the mV(2)R was 3- to 5-fold less abundantly expressed at the cell surface than the hV(2)R. Laser scanning microscopy of fusion proteins consisting of the V(2)Rs and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (mV(2)R/GFP, hV(2)R/GFP) demonstrated that the hV(2)R/GFP was efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, whereas the mV(2)R/GFP was localized mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Chimeric hV(2)Rs, in which the first and/or second extracellular loop(s) were replaced by the corresponding loop(s) of the mV(2)R, revealed that the second extracellular loop accounts for the differences in ligand binding, but the first extracellular loop accounts for the reduced cell surface expression. The exchange of lysine 100 by aspartate in the first extracellular loop of hV(2)R was sufficient to reduce cell surface expression, which was accompanied by intracellular retention as observed in laser scanning microscopy analysis. Conversely, the exchange of aspartate 100 by lysine in the mV(2)R increased the cell surface expression and resulted in predominant plasma membrane localization. Thus, a single amino acid difference in the first extracellular loop between mV(2)R and hV(2)R determines the efficiency of cell surface expression.

8626511|t|The differential effects of the Gly-60 to Ala mutation on the interaction of H-Ras p21 with different downstream targets.
8626511|t|We examined the effects of the Gly-60 to Ala mutation on the interaction of H-Ras with Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromin 1 (NF1), Raf-1, and ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (ralGDS), factors that interact with GTP-bound form of H-Ras. Previous study has shown that the G60A mutation perturbs GTP-induced conformational changes of H-Ras. We found that the G60A mutation decreases GTPase activity of H-Ras without significantly affecting GTP/GDP binding. The reduction in GTPase activity is most dramatic in the presence of GAP or NF1. Interestingly, the G60A mutation does not appear to alter the affinity of H-Ras for GAP or NF1. The G60A mutation moderately reduces the binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 Ras binding domain; however, the binding of H-Ras to ralGDS Ras binding domain was more significantly affected by the same mutation. These results indicate that although GAP, NF1, Raf-1, and ralGDS all interact with H-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and they are able to compete against each other for binding to H-Ras, these factors share overlapping but not identical binding domains on H-Ras. The significance of our findings is discussed in the light of the GTP-induced conformational change model.

9628846|t|Involvement of amino acid residues 423-429 of human protein S in binding to C4b-binding protein.
9628846|t|Human protein S binds to C4b-binding protein (C4BP) both in plasma and in a system using purified proteins. Amino acid residues 420-434 of the first disulfide loop of the sex hormone binding globulinlike domain of protein S are involved in the interaction of protein S with C4BP. To define the involvement of specific polar amino acids within residues 420-434, we studied in parallel synthetic protein S peptides and recombinant protein S variants containing the same amino acid replacements, K423E, E424K, Q427E and K429E. Synthetic peptide analogs of peptide PSP-420 (residues 420-434) were assayed for binding C4BP and as inhibitors of complex formation. The PSP-420 peptide and the analogous peptide with the substitution E424K, but not the peptides containing the substitutions K423E and K429E, were able to bind C4BP. Recombinant proteins with mutations of K423E, Q427E and K429E showed reduced affinity for C4BP compared to plasma protein S, recombinant wild type protein S, or E424K-protein S. These results suggest that Lys-423, Gln-427 and Lys-429 of protein S are important for normal binding to C4BP. The anti-protein S monoclonal antibody LJ-56, raised against peptide PSP-420, recognizes only free protein S and inhibits complex formation with C4BP. Antibody LJ-56 recognized the E424K and Q427E peptides but not the K423E or K429E peptides. Similarly, the E424K and Q427E protein S mutants were recognized by LJ-56, whereas the K423E and K429E protein S mutants were not recognized. This suggests that both in the peptide PSP-420 and in protein S, Lys-423 and Lys-429 significantly contribute to binding to antibody LJ-56. These results demonstrate that protein S residues 423, 427 and 429, but not residue 424, are involved in binding to both the antibody LJ-56 and to C4BP. When peptides PSP 420 and SL-6 (residues 447-460) with carboxyterminal amide or carboxylate moieties were compared to their ability to inhibit C4BP-protein S complexation, PSP-420-amide was the most potent. This finding together with the other results described here supports the hypothesis that the residues 420 and 434 in protein S provides a major binding site for C4BP.

25115399|t|Nuclear and cytoplasmic p53 suppress cell invasion by inhibiting respiratory complex-I activity via Bcl-2 family proteins.
25115399|t|Although the p53 tumor suppressor/transcription factor often accumulates in the cytoplasm of healthy cells, limited information is available on the cytoplasmic function of p53. Here, we show that cytoplasmic p53 suppresses cell invasion by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Analysis revealed that this function is mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins: Cytoplasmic p53 binds Bcl-w, liberating Bax, which then binds ND5, a subunit of respiratory complex-I, thereby suppressing complex-I activity and thus ROS production. The G13289A mutation of ND5, identified in cancer patients, prevents Bax/ND5 interactions and promotes ROS production and cell invasion. We also showed that Bcl-XL and Bak can substitute for Bcl-w and Bax, respectively, regulating complex-I activity and supporting the cytoplasmic function of p53; nuclear p53 also suppresses complex-I activity by inducing Bax expression. Studies in animal models support the notion that p53 and Bcl-2 family proteins exhibit these functions in vivo. This study demonstrates a link between p53 and Bcl-2 proteins as regulators of ROS production and cellular invasiveness, and reveals complex-I, especially ND5, as their functional target.

20559570|t|Etk/Bmx regulates proteinase-activated-receptor1 (PAR1) in breast cancer invasion: signaling partners, hierarchy and physiological significance.
20559570|t|BACKGROUND: While protease-activated-receptor 1 (PAR(1)) plays a central role in tumor progression, little is known about the cell signaling involved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show here the impact of PAR(1) cellular activities using both an orthotopic mouse mammary xenograft and a colorectal-liver metastasis model in vivo, with biochemical analyses in vitro. Large and highly vascularized tumors were generated by cells over-expressing wt hPar1, Y397Z hPar1, with persistent signaling, or Y381A hPar1 mutant constructs. In contrast, cells over-expressing the truncated form of hPar1, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, developed small or no tumors, similar to cells expressing empty vector or control untreated cells. Antibody array membranes revealed essential hPar1 partners including Etk/Bmx and Shc. PAR(1) activation induces Etk/Bmx and Shc binding to the receptor C-tail to form a complex. Y/A mutations in the PAR(1) C-tail did not prevent Shc-PAR(1) association, but enhanced the number of liver metastases compared with the already increased metastases obtained with wt hPar1. We found that Etk/Bmx first binds via the PH domain to a region of seven residues, located between C378-S384 in PAR(1) C-tail, enabling subsequent Shc association. Importantly, expression of the hPar1-7A mutant form (substituted A, residues 378-384), which is incapable of binding Etk/Bmx, resulted in inhibition of invasion through Matrigel-coated membranes. Similarly, knocking down Etk/Bmx inhibited PAR(1)-induced MDA-MB-435 cell migration. In addition, intact spheroid morphogenesis of MCF10A cells is markedly disrupted by the ectopic expression of wt hPar1. In contrast, the forced expression of the hPar1-7A mutant results in normal ball-shaped spheroids. Thus, by preventing binding of Etk/Bmx to PAR(1) -C-tail, hPar1 oncogenic properties are abrogated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first demonstration that a cytoplasmic portion of the PAR(1) C-tail functions as a scaffold site. We identify here essential signaling partners, determine the hierarchy of binding and provide a platform for therapeutic vehicles via definition of the critical PAR(1)-associating region in the breast cancer signaling niche.

18202149|t|Progesterone receptor rapid signaling mediates serine 345 phosphorylation and tethering to specificity protein 1 transcription factors.
18202149|t|Human progesterone receptors (PR) rapidly activate cytosolic signaling pathways, in addition to their classical function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Using ER+/PR-B+ T47D breast cancer cells, we probed the role of progestin-stimulated rapid PR signaling in the transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in breast cancer cell proliferation. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was rapidly activated after a 10-min treatment with R5020. Progestin induced EGFR-, c-Src-, and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of PR-B on the MAPK consensus site, Ser345. Ser345-phosphorylated PR-B receptors strongly associated with specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factors to regulate PR cell cycle (p21) and growth-promoting (EGFR) target genes whose promoters lack canonical progesterone response element sequences. Inhibitors of EGFR, c-Src, or MAPK activities blocked PR tethering to Sp1 and progestin-stimulated S-phase entry. Mutant PR-B receptors defective for c-Src binding (mPro) were not phosphorylated on Ser345 in response to progestin and failed to interact with Sp1. Hormone-induced complexes containing Sp1 and wild-type PR-B, but not S345A or mPro PR-B, were recruited to Sp1 sites within the endogenous p21 promoter. Progestin-induced S-phase entry was attenuated in T47D cells containing wild-type PR-B and treated with EGFR, c-Src, or MAPK kinase inhibitors or in T47D cells stably expressing mPro or mutant DNA-binding domain PR-B. In sum, rapid progestin-activated PR signaling leads to PR Ser345 phosphorylation and tethering to Sp1. These events are critical for progestin-stimulated regulation of Sp1 target genes and breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic potential for PR-targeted breast cancer treatment by exploiting multiple nodes along the PR signaling pathway, including PR-B, EGFR, c-Src, MAPK, or Sp1.

10611223|t|p21-activated kinase 1 phosphorylates the death agonist bad and protects cells from apoptosis.
10611223|t|Bad is a critical regulatory component of the intrinsic cell death machinery that exerts its death-promoting effect upon heterodimerization with the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). Growth factors promote cell survival through phosphorylation of Bad, resulting in its dissociation from Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) and its association with 14-3-3tau. Survival of interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent FL5.12 lymphoid progenitor cells is attenuated upon treatment with the Rho GTPase-inactivating toxin B from Clostridium difficile. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is activated by IL-3 in FL5.12 cells, and this activation is reduced by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Overexpression of a constitutively active PAK mutant (PAK1-T423E) promoted cell survival of FL5.12 and NIH 3T3 cells, while overexpression of the autoinhibitory domain of PAK (amino acids 83 to 149) enhanced apoptosis. PAK phosphorylates Bad in vitro and in vivo on Ser112 and Ser136, resulting in a markedly reduced interaction between Bad and Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) and the increased association of Bad with 14-3-3tau. Our findings indicate that PAK inhibits the proapoptotic effects of Bad by direct phosphorylation and that PAK may play an important role in cell survival pathways.

16314417|t|Interacting residues in an activated state of a G protein-coupled receptor.
16314417|t|Ste2p, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for the tridecapeptide pheromone alpha-factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used as a model GPCR to investigate the role of specific residues in the resting and activated states of the receptor. Using a series of biological and biochemical analyses of wild-type and site-directed mutant receptors, we identified Asn(205) as a potential interacting partner with the Tyr(266) residue. An N205H/Y266H double mutant showed pH-dependent functional activity, whereas the N205H receptor was non-functional and the Y266H receptor was partially active indicating that the histidine 205 and 266 residues interact in an activated state of the receptor. The introduction of N205K or Y266D mutations into the P258L/S259L constitutively active receptor suppressed the constitutive activity; in contrast, the N205K/Y266D/P258L/S259L quadruple mutant was fully constitutively active, again indicating an interaction between residues at the 205 and 206 positions in the receptor-active state. To further test this interaction, we introduced the N205C/Y266C, F204C/Y266C, and N205C/A265C double mutations into wild-type and P258L/S259L constitutively active receptors. After trypsin digestion, we found that a disulfide-cross-linked product, with the molecular weight expected for a receptor fragment with a cross-link between N205C and Y266C, formed only in the N205C/Y266C constitutively activated receptor. This study represents the first experimental demonstration of an interaction between specific residues in an active state, but not the resting state, of Ste2p. The information gained from this study should contribute to an understanding of the conformational differences between resting and active states in GPCRs.

18815136|t|Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pluripotent cytokine that is involved in host immune and inflammatory responses, as well as tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of MIF function is unclear. Here we report that the NM23-H1 interacts with MIF in cells, as demonstrated by cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Analysis of cysteine (Cys) to serine (Ser) substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and MIF (C57S, C60S, and C81S) revealed that Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(60) of MIF are responsible for complex formation. NM23-H1-MIF complexes were dependent on reducing conditions, such as the presence of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol, but not H(2)O(2). NM23-H1 alleviated the MIF-mediated suppression of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by promoting the dissociation of MIF from MIF-p53 complexes. In addition, NM23-H1 significantly inhibited the MIF-induced proliferation of quiescent NIH 3T3 cells through a direct interaction with MIF, and decreased the MIF-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PDK1 and p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase. The results of the current study suggest that the NM23-H1 functions as a negative regulator of MIF.

8106517|t|Biochemical characterization of yeast RAS2 mutants reveals a new region of ras protein involved in the interaction with GTPase-activating proteins.
8106517|t|We report biochemical characterization of two recently identified mutants of yeast RAS2, RAS2-E99K and RAS2-E130K. These mutants exhibit dominant activating phenotypes in yeast. Characterization of their intrinsic GTPase and GDP dissociation as well as their ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase showed that these activities of RAS2-E99K mutant protein were similar to those of the wild type protein. RAS2-E130K protein, on the other hand, differed from the wild type protein with a fast GDP dissociation rate and 2-fold higher activation of adenylate cyclase. When the sensitivity to GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was examined, we found that the RAS2-E99K protein was approximately 1200-fold less sensitive to NF1-GAP activity. In addition, the affinity for NF1 as revealed by competition binding experiments was reduced more than 150-fold with RAS2-E99K protein. Thus, the RAS2-E99K mutation affects interaction with GAP proteins. This mutation is particularly interesting because it is the first mutation identified in the alpha 3 region of ras protein that affects GAP interaction. The alpha 3 region appears to be directly involved in interaction with NF1, since peptides containing the sequence encompassing residue 99 of RAS2 inhibit NF1-GAP activity. These results suggest that the interaction between ras and GAP involves a larger region within ras than previously recognized.

7615549|t|Characterization of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in vitro by focal adhesion kinase.
7615549|t|The concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, and the tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in response to multiple stimuli including integrin-mediated cell adhesion suggests that paxillin phosphorylation is closely coupled to FAK activity. In the present study, we have identified a specific tyrosine residue within paxillin, tyrosine 118 (Tyr-118), that represents the principle site of phosphorylation by FAK in vitro. The identification of this site as a target for FAK phosphorylation was accomplished by immunoprecipitating FAK and performing in vitro kinase assays, using as substrate either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-paxillin fusion proteins containing truncations in paxillin sequence or fusion proteins with phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosine residues. GST-paxillin containing a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-118 (Y118F) was not phosphorylated by FAK immunoprecipitates; however, this mutant was shown to bind FAK equally as well as the wild type fusion protein. As a first step toward assessing the function of paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-118, a Y118F paxillin cDNA construct was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Similar to wild type paxillin, mutated paxillin localized to focal adhesions, indicating that the phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-118 is not essential for the recruitment of paxillin to sites of cell adhesion.

12684503|t|Identification of the human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 domains responsible for agonist binding specificity.
12684503|t|When co-expressed with receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) can function as a receptor for both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM). To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91-94, 96-100, or 101-103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78-80 or 88-90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91-103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101-103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101-103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells.

10766840|t|Ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 is independent of phosphorylation on threonine 286.
10766840|t|Cyclin D1 binds and regulates the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6. Phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D1.CDK4/6 complexes during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle promotes entry into S phase. Cyclin D1 protein is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Previous studies have demonstrated that cyclin D1 ubiquitination is dependent on its phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) on threonine 286 and that this phosphorylation event is greatly enhanced by binding to CDK4 (Diehl, J. A., Cheng, M. G., Roussel, M. F., and Sherr, C. J. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 3499-3511). We now report an additional pathway for the ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 (unbound to CDKs). We show that, when unbound to CDK4, a cyclin D1-T286A mutant is ubiquitinated. Further, we show that a mutant of cyclin D1 that cannot bind to CDK4 (cyclin D1-KE) is also ubiquitinated in vivo. Our results demonstrate that free cyclin D1 is ubiquitinated independently of its phosphorylation on threonine 286 by GSK-3beta, suggesting that, as has been shown for cyclin E, distinct pathways of ubiquitination lead to the degradation of free and CDK-bound cyclin D1. The pathway responsible for ubiquitination of free cyclin D1 may be important in limiting the effects of cyclin D1 overexpression in a variety of cancers.

19147558|t|Tenascin-C is a novel RBPJkappa-induced target gene for Notch signaling in gliomas.
19147558|t|Tenascin-C (TNC) expression is known to correlate with malignancy in glioblastoma (GBM), a highly invasive and aggressive brain tumor that shows limited response to conventional therapies. In these malignant gliomas as well as in GBM cell lines, we found Notch2 protein to be strongly expressed. In a GBM tumor tissue microarray, RBPJk protein, a Notch2 cofactor for transcription, was found to be significantly coexpressed with TNC. We show that the TNC gene is transactivated by Notch2 in an RBPJk-dependent manner mediated by an RBPJk binding element in the TNC promoter. The transactivation is abrogated by a Notch2 mutation, which we detected in the glioma cell line Hs683 that does not express TNC. This L1711M mutation resides in the RAM domain, the site of interaction between Notch2 and RBPJk. In addition, transfection of constructs encoding activated Notch2 or Notch1 increased endogenous TNC expression identifying TNC as a novel Notch target gene. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of the transcriptional coactivator MAML1 or knocking down RBPJk in LN319 cells led to a dramatic decrease in TNC protein levels accompanied by a significant reduction of cell migration. Because addition of purified TNC stimulated glioma cell migration, this represents a mechanism for the invasive properties of glioma cells controlled by Notch signaling and defines a novel oncogenic pathway in gliomagenesis that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in GBM patients.

19903340|t|PTEN inhibits BMI1 function independently of its phosphatase activity.
19903340|t|BACKGROUND: PTEN is the second most mutated tumor suppressor gene other than p53. It suppresses tumorigenesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), thereby directly inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-mediated tumorigenic activities. Consistent with this model of action, cytosolic PTEN is recruited to the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PIP3. While nuclear PTEN has been shown to suppress tumorigenesis by governing genome integrity, additional mechanisms may also contribute to nuclear PTEN-mediated tumor suppression. The nuclear protein BMI1 promotes stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis and PTEN inhibits these events, suggesting that PTEN may suppress BMI1 function. RESULTS: We investigated whether PTEN inhibits BMI1 function during prostate tumorigenesis. PTEN binds to BMI1 exclusively in the nucleus. This interaction does not require PTEN's phosphatase activity, as phosphatase-deficient PTEN mutants, PTEN/C124S (CS), PTEN/G129E (GE), and a C-terminal PTEN fragment (C-PTEN) excluding the catalytic domain, all associate with BMI1. Furthermore, the residues 186-286 of C-PTEN are sufficient for binding to BMI1. This interaction reduces BMI1's function. BMI1 enhances hTERT activity and reduces p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) expression. These effects were attenuated by PTEN, PTEN(CS), PTEN(GE), and C-PTEN. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN in DU145 cells increased hTERT promoter activity, which was reversed when BMI1 was concomitantly knocked-down, indicating that PTEN reduces hTERT promoter activity via inhibiting BMI1 function. Conversely, BMI1 reduces PTEN's ability to inhibit AKT activation, which can be attributed to its interaction with PTEN in the nucleus, making PTEN unavailable to dephosphorylate membrane-bound PIP3. Furthermore, BMI1 appears to co-localize with PTEN more frequently in clinical prostate tissue samples from patients diagnosed with PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and carcinoma compared to normal prostate epithelium. While PTEN co-localized with BMI1 in 2.4% of normal prostate epithelial cells, co-localization was observed in 37.6% and 18.5% of cells in PIN and carcinoma, respectively. Collectively, we demonstrate that PTEN inhibits BMI1 function via binding to BMI1 in a phosphatase independent manner. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that nuclear PTEN reduces BMI1 function independently of its phosphatase activity. It was recently observed that nuclear PTEN also suppresses tumorigenesis. Our results, therefore, provide a plausible mechanism by which nuclear PTEN prevents tumorigenesis.

15489903|t|The interaction of p53 with replication protein A mediates suppression of homologous recombination.
15489903|t|The tumor suppressor protein p53 is emerging as a central regulator of homologous recombination (HR) processes and DNA replication. P53 may downregulate HR through multiple mechanisms including the reported associations with the Rad51 and Rad54 recombinases, and the BLM and WRN helicases. Here, we investigated whether the interaction of p53 with human replication protein A (RPA) is necessary for the regulation of HR. By employing a plasmid-based HR assay in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells, we studied the HR-suppressing properties of a panel of p53 mutants, which varied in their ability to interact with RPA. Both wild-type p53 and a transactivation-deficient p53 mutant (L22Q/W23S) suppressed HR and prevented RPA binding to ssDNA in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, p53 mutations that specifically disrupt the RPA-binding domain, while not compromising p53 transactivation function (D48H/D49H and W53S/F54S), did not affect HR. Suppression of HR was also not seen with missense mutations in the p53 core domain (His175 and His273), which retained the ability to interact with RPA, suggesting that the disruption of additional binding interactions of p53, for example, with Rad51 or recombination intermediates, also impacts on HR. We hypothesize that sequestration of RPA by p53 at the sites of recombination is one means by which p53 can inhibit HR processes. Our data support and extend the previously formulated 'dual model' of p53's role as guardian of the genome.

23848298|t|Polycystin-2 induces a conformational change in polycystin-1.
23848298|t|Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in the genes encoding either polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2). PC2 acts as a nonselective cation channel and together with PC1 plays a role in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have shown previously that the N and C termini of PC1 appear as unequally sized particles connected by a "string" largely composed of tandem immunoglobulin-like, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains. Here, we show that coexpression of PC1 and PC2 causes an elongation of the PC1 string and a corresponding reduction in the size of the larger (C-terminal) particle. This change in the conformation of PC1 does not depend on its delivery to the plasma membrane. In addition, the use of the L3040H PC1 mutant showed that the conformational change does not require GPS cleavage. Coexpression of PC1 with PC2 mutants revealed that the conformational change in PC1 does not require either a stable interaction between PC1 and PC2 or PC2 channel function. Finally, we show that the tandem PKD repeats and to a lesser extent the receptor for egg jelly (REJ) domain both contribute to the extension of the PC1 string in the presence of PC2. We propose that the PKD repeats detach from the C-terminal fragment in response to PC2 activity. The resulting remodeling of PC1 may be responsible for enhancing GPS cleavage of PC1 and the separation of the PC1 N-terminal fragment from the C terminus during its maturation.

19843520|t|Beta integrin tyrosine phosphorylation is a conserved mechanism for regulating talin-induced integrin activation.
19843520|t|Integrins are large membrane-spanning receptors fundamental to cell adhesion and migration. Integrin adhesiveness for the extracellular matrix is activated by the cytoskeletal protein talin via direct binding of its phosphotyrosine-binding-like F3 domain to the cytoplasmic tail of the beta integrin subunit. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the signaling protein Dok1, on the other hand, has an inactivating effect on integrins, a phenomenon that is modulated by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Using full-length tyrosine-phosphorylated (15)N-labeled beta3, beta1A, and beta7 integrin tails and an NMR-based protein-protein interaction assay, we show that talin1 binds to the NPXY motif and the membrane-proximal portion of beta3, beta1A, and beta7 tails, and that the affinity of this interaction is decreased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok1 only interacts weakly with unphosphorylated tails, but its affinity is greatly increased by integrin tyrosine phosphorylation. The Dok1 interaction remains restricted to the integrin NPXY region, thus phosphorylation inhibits integrin activation by increasing the affinity of beta integrin tails for a talin competitor that does not form activating membrane-proximal interactions with the integrin. Key residues governing these specificities were identified by detailed structural analysis, and talin1 was engineered to bind preferentially to phosphorylated integrins by introducing the mutation D372R. As predicted, this mutation affects talin1 localization in live cells in an integrin phosphorylation-specific manner. Together, these results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism for regulating integrin activation, despite subtle differences in how these integrins interact with their binding proteins.

15485912|t|Interactions of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) subunit NIP1/c with eIF1 and eIF5 promote preinitiation complex assembly and regulate start codon selection.
15485912|t|The N-terminal domain (NTD) of NIP1/eIF3c interacts directly with eIF1 and eIF5 and indirectly through eIF5 with the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA(i)(Met) ternary complex (TC) to form the multifactor complex (MFC). We investigated the physiological importance of these interactions by mutating 16 segments spanning the NIP1-NTD. Mutations in multiple segments reduced the binding of eIF1 or eIF5 to the NIP1-NTD. Mutating a C-terminal segment of the NIP1-NTD increased utilization of UUG start codons (Sui(-) phenotype) and was lethal in cells expressing eIF5-G31R that is hyperactive in stimulating GTP hydrolysis by the TC at AUG codons. Both effects of this NIP1 mutation were suppressed by eIF1 overexpression, as was the Sui(-) phenotype conferred by eIF5-G31R. Mutations in two N-terminal segments of the NIP1-NTD suppressed the Sui(-) phenotypes produced by the eIF1-D83G and eIF5-G31R mutations. From these and other findings, we propose that the NIP1-NTD coordinates an interaction between eIF1 and eIF5 that inhibits GTP hydrolysis at non-AUG codons. Two NIP1-NTD mutations were found to derepress GCN4 translation in a manner suppressed by overexpressing the TC, indicating that MFC formation stimulates TC recruitment to 40S ribosomes. Thus, the NIP1-NTD is required for efficient assembly of preinitiation complexes and also regulates the selection of AUG start codons in vivo.

7832783|t|Thrombin interaction with a recombinant N-terminal extracellular domain of the thrombin receptor in an acellular system.
7832783|t|The cDNA of the human endothelial cell thrombin receptor has been cloned and a chimeric fusion protein consisting of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and the portion 25-97 corresponding to the N-terminal first extracellular domain of the thrombin receptor (TRE) has been expressed in Escherichia coli. Introduction of a factor Xa cleavage site in the fusion protein allowed purification of TRE after removal from the GST carrier protein. Purified GST-TRE or TRE have been tested in solution for their ability to interact with thrombin. alpha-Thrombin cleaved the fusion protein at position Arg-41-Ser-42 of TRE in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and GST-TRE competed with the tripeptidic substrate S-2238 for hydrolysis by thrombin (Ki = 0.5 microM). gamma-Thrombin that lacks the anion-binding exosite was 100-fold less potent than alpha-thrombin at cleaving GST-TRE. TRE competed with polymerizing fibrin monomers for binding to thrombin (Ki = 7.5 microM). The cleavage of GST-TRE by alpha-thrombin was inhibited by several alpha-thrombin exosite ligands such as the C-terminal peptide of hirudin, thrombomodulin and fibrin(ogen) fragment E. In contrast, platelet glycocalicin did not inhibit GST-TRE cleavage. In conclusion, the use of purified soluble GST-TRE allowed us to derive an affinity constant for thrombin interaction with the N-terminal domain of the receptor and to confirm the location of the cleavage site at Arg41-Ser-42 of the receptor. The importance of the thrombin anion-binding exosite for thrombin receptor recognition is highlighted by the low reactivity of gamma-thrombin for GST-TRE and by competition experiments, which in addition indicate that binding sites for fibrin(ogen), thrombomodulin and GST-TRE are overlapping. In contrast, binding of thrombin to GST-TRE and glycocalicin are not mutually exclusive, indicating that glycocalicin and TRE interact with discrete subsites within the large groove that constitutes the anion-binding exosite.

24967972|t|Molecular modulation of the copper and cisplatin transport function of CTR1 and its interaction with IRS-4.
24967972|t|The copper influx transporter CTR1 is also a major influx transporter for cisplatin (cDDP) in tumor cells. It influences the cytotoxicity of cDDP both in vivo and in vitro. Whereas Cu triggers internalization of CTR1 from the plasma membrane, cDDP does not. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects, myc-tagged forms of wild type hCTR1 and variants in which Y103 was converted to alanine, C189 was converted to serine, or the K178/K179 dilysine motif was converted to alanines were re-expressed in mouse embryo cells in which both alleles of CTR1 had been knocked out and also in HEK293T cells. The Y103A mutation and to a lesser extent the C189S mutation reduced internalization of CTR1 induced by Cu while the K178A/K179A had little effect. Both Y103 and C189 were required for Cu and cDDP transport whereas the K178/K179 motif was not. While Y103 lies in an YXXM motif that, when phosphorylated, is a potential docking site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and other proteins involved in endocytosis, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated myc-CTR1, and proteomic analysis of peptides derived from CTR1, failed to identify any basal or Cu-induced phosphorylation. However, proteomic analysis did identify an interaction of CTR1 with IRS-4 and this was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK cells expressing either FLAG-CTR1 or myc-CTR1. The interaction was greater in the Y103A-expressing cells. We conclude that Y103 is required for the internalization of hCTR1 in response to Cu, that this occurs by a mechanism other than phosphorylation and that mutation of Y103 modulates the interaction with IRS-4.

24928514|t|A novel interaction between the SH2 domain of signaling adaptor protein Nck-1 and the upstream regulator of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) promotes Rac1 activation and cell motility.
24928514|t|Nck family proteins function as adaptors to couple tyrosine phosphorylation signals to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Several lines of evidence indicate that Nck family proteins involve in regulating the activity of Rho family GTPases. In the present study, we characterized a novel interaction between Nck-1 with engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1). GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the Nck-1-ELMO1 interaction is mediated by the SH2 domain of Nck-1 and the phosphotyrosine residues at position 18, 216, 395, and 511 of ELMO1. A R308K mutant of Nck-1 (in which the SH2 domain was inactive), or a 4YF mutant of ELMO1 lacking these four phosphotyrosine residues, diminished Nck-1-ELMO1 interaction. Conversely, tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor treatment and overexpression of Src family kinase Hck significantly enhanced Nck-1-ELMO1 interaction. Moreover, wild type Nck-1, but not R308K mutant, significantly augmented the interaction between ELMO1 and constitutively active RhoG (RhoG(V12A)), thus promoted Rac1 activation and cell motility. Taken together, the present study characterized a novel Nck-1-ELMO1 interaction and defined a new role for Nck-1 in regulating Rac1 activity.

11175351|t|The Crk signaling pathway contributes to the bombesin-induced activation of the small GTPase Rap1 in Swiss 3T3 cells.
11175351|t|Rap1 is a small GTPase implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation. The mechanisms how endogenous Rap1 is activated by many mitogenic stimuli including the neuropeptide bombesin remained unclear. Here we analyse which signaling pathways are necessary for Rap1 activation. Bombesin-mediated Rap1 activation in Swiss 3T3 and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts requires signaling components similar to those being essential for complex formation between p130Cas and Crk adapter proteins. The Crk/CRKL-binding region of the Rap1-specific exchange factor C3G (CBR) inhibits the bombesin-stimulated Rap1 activity in transfected Swiss 3T3 cells. Further characterization in COS cells showed that the CBR or a c-Crk I SH3 mutant specifically reduces both the basal as well as the stimulated Rap1 activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Ras is not affected. The CBR is complexed with endogenous c-Crk II and CRKL and blocks the protein association with catalytically active C3G. Such suppressors of Crk signaling do not affect Erk-phosphorylation induced by bombesin. Embryonic fibroblasts from b-raf knockout mice showed a bombesin-inducible Erk-phosphorylation, providing evidence that B-Raf does not link Rap1 to Erk-activation in bombesin-stimulated fibroblasts. We conclude that cellular Crk/CRKL complexes, recruited to upstream signaling components, contribute to basal and bombesin-induced Rap1 activity, which is independent from the Ras-Raf-Erk pathway under these circumstances.

27940962|t|RB localizes to DNA double-strand breaks and promotes DNA end resection and homologous recombination through the recruitment of BRG1.
27940962|t|The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is recognized as a master regulator that controls entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Its loss leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and is a hallmark of cancer. RB works by binding to members of the E2F family of transcription factors and recruiting chromatin modifiers to the promoters of E2F target genes. Here we show that RB also localizes to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on E2F1 and ATM kinase activity and promotes DSB repair through homologous recombination (HR), and its loss results in genome instability. RB is necessary for the recruitment of the BRG1 ATPase to DSBs, which stimulates DNA end resection and HR. A knock-in mutation of the ATM phosphorylation site on E2F1 (S29A) prevents the interaction between E2F1 and TopBP1 and recruitment of RB, E2F1, and BRG1 to DSBs. This knock-in mutation also impairs DNA repair, increases genomic instability, and renders mice hypersensitive to IR. Importantly, depletion of RB in osteosarcoma and breast cancer cell lines results in sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs, which is further exacerbated by poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We uncovered a novel, nontranscriptional function for RB in HR, which could contribute to genome instability associated with RB loss.

16252010|t|TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination regulates nuclear translocation of NRIF, the p75 receptor interactor.
16252010|t|TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates signaling from members of the tumor necrosis factor and Toll-like receptor superfamilies, including the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Recently, TRAF6 was shown to bind to another p75 cytoplasmic interactor, NRIF, and promote its nuclear localization. Here, we demonstrate that NRIF is a substrate for TRAF6-mediated K63 polyubiquitination and that this modification is necessary for its nuclear translocation. Activation of p75 resulted in NRIF polyubiquitination, association with TRAF6 and nuclear localization. NRIF was polyubiquitinated by TRAF6 in vitro and in cultured cells, and this was abrogated by mutation of K19 in the amino-terminus of NRIF. The K19R mutant NRIF displayed reduced TRAF6 association and neurotrophin-dependent nuclear localization. In neurons from traf6-/- mice, NRIF failed to enter the nucleus in response to p75 activation, and polyubiquitination and nuclear localization were attenuated in traf6-/- brain. Finally, unlike wild-type NRIF, the K19R NRIF failed to reconstitute p75-mediated apoptosis in nrif-/- neurons. These results reveal a unique mechanism of p75 signaling and a novel role for K63-linked ubiquitin chains.

15699036|t|Beta3 tyrosine phosphorylation and alphavbeta3-mediated adhesion are required for Vav1 association and Rho activation in leukocytes.
15699036|t|Integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic cells to vitronectin results in activation of the Rho GTPases. Mutation of beta(3) tyrosine residue 747, previously shown to disrupt cell adhesion, results in sustained activation of Cdc42 and diminished Rac and Rho activity. We investigated the role of the hematopoietically restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 in alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion. We find that Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac and Rho, associates with alpha(v)beta(3) upon cell adhesion to vitronectin and that this association requires beta(3) tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of exogenous Vav1 demonstrates that Y160F, but not wild type or the Vav1Y174F mutant, inhibits Rac and Rho activation during alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin. Cells expressing Vav1Y160F exhibit a sustained Cdc42 activation similar to nonphosphorylatable beta(3) mutants. In addition, cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion are severely suppressed in Vav1Y160F-transfected cells, and Vav1Y160F fails to associate with beta(3) integrins. Furthermore, Vav1 itself is selectively phosphorylated upon tyrosine 160 after alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated adhesion, and the association between Vav1 and beta(3) occurs in specific response to adhesion to substrate. These studies describe a phosphorylation-dependent association between beta(3) integrin and Vav1 which is essential for cell progression to a Rho-dominant phenotype during cell adhesion.

12514174|t|JNK1 physically interacts with WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WOX1) and inhibits WOX1-mediated apoptosis.
12514174|t|Transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) promotes cell survival, whereas persistent JNK activation induces apoptosis. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 activates JNK1 and protects L929 fibroblasts from staurosporine-mediated cell death. PH-20 also induces the expression of a p53-interacting WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WOX1, also known as WWOX or FOR) in these cells. WOX1 enhances the cytotoxic function of tumor necrosis factor and mediates apoptosis synergistically with p53. Thus, the activated JNK1 is likely to counteract WOX1 in mediating apoptosis. Here it is demonstrated that ectopic JNK1 inhibited WOX1-mediated apoptosis of L929 fibroblasts, monocytic U937 cells, and other cell types. Also, JNK1 blocked WOX1 prevention of cell cycle progression. By stimulating cells with anisomycin or UV light, JNK1 became activated, and WOX1 was phosphorylated at Tyr(33). The activated JNK1 physically interacted with the phosphorylated WOX1, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Alteration of Tyr(33) to Arg(33) in WOX1 abrogated its binding interaction with JNK1 and its activity in mediating cell death, indicating that Tyr(33) phosphorylation is needed to activate WOX1. A dominant negative WOX1 was developed and shown to block p53-mediated apoptosis and anisomycin-mediated WOX1 phosphorylation but could not inhibit JNK1 activation. This mutant protein bound p53 but could not interact with JNK1, as determined in yeast two-hybrid analysis. Taken together, phosphorylation of JNK1 and WOX1 is necessary for their physical interaction and functional antagonism.

11882361|t|The lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase Lyp interacts with the adaptor molecule Grb2 and functions as a negative regulator of T-cell activation.
11882361|t|OBJECTIVE: Following activation of T cells, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues occurs through a complex signaling process involving protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, and a variety of adapter molecules including Grb2. We have attempted to identify new signaling molecules that are important for the activation response. METHODS: Using a protein interaction screening protocol based on phage display, T-cell signaling components that associate with the adapter molecule, Grb2, the lymphoid-specific tyrosine phosphatase Lyp was identified. Using transcriptional reporter assays, the role of Lyp in T-cell activation was studied by overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive mutants of Lyp. RESULTS: A GST fusion containing the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 bound to the nucleotide exchange factor Sos or Grb2-associated binder 2 (Gab2). In contrast, the N-terminal SH3-containing fusion bound to the protein tyrosine phosphatase Lyp. Grb2 was co-immunoprecipitated with Lyp in 293T cells overexpressing both proteins. Using Northern blot analysis, Lyp was found to be expressed predominantly in hematopoietic tissue, including spleen, lymph node, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver. Two human T-cell lines, Jurkat and HuT78, expressed both Lyp mRNA and protein. Overexpression of wild-type Lyp or a catalytically inactive, substrate-trapping mutant (D195A) in Jurkat cells inhibited transcriptional activity initiated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. In contrast, two other catalytically inactive mutants (R233M or C227S) had no effect. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a novel interaction between the phosphatase Lyp and the adaptor Grb2 and are consistent with a negative regulatory role for Lyp in T-cell signaling.

25544752|t|Phosphorylation of Tip60 by p38α regulates p53-mediated PUMA induction and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
25544752|t|Tip60 is a multifunctional acetyltransferase involved in multiple cellular functions. Acetylation of p53 at K120 by Tip60 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis after DNA damage. We previous showed that Tip60 activity is induced by phosphorylation at T158 by p38. In this study, we investigated the role of p38-mediated Tip60 phosphorylation in p53-mediated, DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We found that DNA damage induces p38 activation, Tip60-T158 phosphorylation, and p53-K120 acetylation with similar kinetics. p38α is essential for DNA damage-induced Tip60-T158 phosphorylation. In addition, both p38α and Tip60 are essential for p53-K120 acetylation, binding of p53 to PUMA promoter, PUMA expression and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Moreover, DNA damage induces protein kinase activity of p38α towards Tip60-T158, and constitutive activation of p38 in cells leads to increases in Tip60-T158 phosphorylation, p53-K120 acetylation, PUMA expression and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Tip60-T158A mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by p38 fails to mediate p53-K120 acetylation, PUMA induction, and apoptosis following DNA damage. These results establish that Tip60-T158 phosphorylation by p38 plays an essential role in stimulating Tip60 activity required for inducing the p53-PUMA pathway that ultimately leads to apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which provides a mechanistic basis for the tumor-suppressing function of p38 and Tip60.

7682895|t|Phospholipase C-gamma 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase are the downstream mediators of the PDGF receptor's mitogenic signal.
7682895|t|Upon ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) beta subunit associates with PLC-gamma 1, RasGAP, P13K, and a 64 kd protein. To determine the relative role of each of these associated proteins in PDGFR signaling, we constructed a PDGFR mutant (F5) unable to bind any of them and a panel of "add-back" mutants that could bind only one of the receptor-associated proteins. F5 PDGFR failed to activate PLC-gamma 1, P13K, or Ras and was unable to trigger DNA synthesis. Permitting association of F5 PDGFR with either PLC-gamma 1 or P13K restored Ras activation and a mitogenic response. Surprisingly, even though binding of the 64 kd protein almost fully restored Ras activation, it did not rescue the receptor's ability to trigger DNA synthesis. Thus Ras activation is insufficient to trigger PDGF-dependent DNA synthesis, and PLC-gamma 1 and P13K are independent downstream mediators of PDGF's mitogenic signal.

10713059|t|Interaction of von Willebrand factor domain A1 with platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha-(1-289). Slow intrinsic binding kinetics mediate rapid platelet adhesion.
10713059|t|We investigated the crucial hemostatic interaction between von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha. Recombinant VWF A1 domain (residues Glu(497)-Pro(705) of VWF) bound stoichiometrically to a GPIbalpha-calmodulin fusion protein (residues His(1)-Val(289) of GPIbalpha; GPIbalpha-CaM) immobilized on W-7-agarose with a K(d) of 3.3 microM. The variant VWF A1(R545A) bound to GPIbalpha-CaM 20-fold more tightly, mainly because the association rate constant k(on) increased from 1,100 to 8,800 M(-1) s(-1). The GPIbalpha mutations G233V and M239V cause platelet-type pseudo-von Willebrand disease, and VWF A1 bound to GPIbalpha(G233V)-CaM and GPIbalpha(M239V)-CaM with a K(d) of 1.0 and 0.63 microM, respectively. The increased affinity of VWF A1 for GPIbalpha(M239V)-CaM was explained by an increase in k(on) to 4,500 M(-1) s(-1). GPIbalpha-CaM bound with similar affinity to recombinant VWF A1, to multimeric plasma VWF, and to a fragment of dispase-digested plasma VWF (residues Leu(480)/Val(481)-Gly(718)). VWF A1 and A1(R545A) bound to platelets with affinities and rate constants similar to those for binding to GPIbalpha-CaM, and botrocetin had the expected positively cooperative effect on the binding of VWF A1 to GPIbalpha-CaM. Therefore, allosteric regulation by botrocetin of VWF A1 binding to GPIbalpha, and the increased binding affinity caused by mutations in VWF or GPIbalpha, are reproduced by isolated structural domains. The substantial increase in k(on) caused by mutations in either A1 or GPIbalpha suggests that productive interaction requires rate-limiting conformational changes in both binding sites. The exceptionally slow k(on) and k(off) provide important new constraints on models for rapid platelet tethering at high wall shear rates.

10318858|t|The autonomous transactivation domain in helix H3 of the vitamin D receptor is required for transactivation and coactivator interaction.
10318858|t|A ligand-inducible transactivation function (AF-2) exists in the extreme carboxyl terminus of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that is essential for 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3)-activated transcription and p160 coactivator interaction. Crystallographic data of related nuclear receptors suggest that binding of 1, 25-(OH)2D3 by VDR induces conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), the most striking of which is a packing of the AF-2 helix onto the LBD adjacent to helices H3 and H4. In this study, a panel of VDR helix H3 mutants was generated, and residues in helix H3 that are important for ligand-activated transcription by the full-length VDR were identified. In particular, one mutant (VDR (Y236A)) exhibited normal ligand binding and heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) but was transcriptionally inactive. Yeast two-hybrid studies and in vitro protein interaction assays demonstrated that VDR (Y236A) was selectively impaired in interaction with AF-2-interacting coactivator proteins such as SRC-1 and GRIP-1. These data indicate an importance of helix H3 in the mechanism of VDR-mediated transcription, and they support the concept that helix H3 functions in concert with the AF-2 domain to form a transactivation surface for binding the p160 class of nuclear receptor coactivators.

11448951|t|Identification of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) amino acids crucial for binding to the murine p75 TNF receptor and construction of receptor-selective mutants.
11448951|t|The bioactivity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is mediated by two TNF receptors (TNF-Rs), more particularly TNF-RI and TNF-RII. Although human TNF (hTNF) and murine TNF (mTNF) are very homologous, hTNF binds only to mTNF-RI. By measuring the binding of a panel of mTNF/hTNF chimeras to both mTNF-R, we pinpointed the TNF region that mediates the interaction with mTNF-RII. Using site-specific mutagenesis, we identified amino acids 71-73 and 89 as the main interacting residues. Mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73 Delta/T89E interacts with both types of mTNF-R and is active in CT6 cell proliferation assays mediated by mTNF-RII. Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Delta 73H/E89T binds to mTNF-RI only and is no longer active on CT6 cells. However, the L929s cytotoxicity of this mutein (an effect mediated by mTNF-RI triggering) was also 100-fold lower than that of wild-type mTNF due to enhanced dissociation during incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. The additional mutation of amino acid 102, resulting in the mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Delta 73H/E89T/P102Q, restored the trimer stability, which led to an enhanced specific activity on L929s cells. Hence the specific activity of a TNF species is governed not only by its receptor binding characteristics but also by its trimer stability after incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. In conclusion, the mutation of TNF amino acids 71-73, 89, and 102 is sufficient to obtain a mTNF mutein selective for mTNF-RI and a hTNF mutein that, unlike wild-type hTNF, also acts on mTNF-RII.

10672519|t|The interface between MyBP-C and myosin: site-directed mutagenesis of the CX myosin-binding domain of MyBP-C.
10672519|t|Myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C or C-protein) is a ca. 130 kDa protein present in the thick filaments of all vertebrate striated muscle. The protein contains ten domains, each of ca. 90-100 amino acids; seven are members of the IgI family of proteins, three of the fibronectin type III family. The motifs are arranged in the following order (from N- to C-terminus): Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig-Ig-Fn-Fn-Ig-Fn-Ig. The C-terminal Ig motif (domain X or CX) contains its light meromyosin-binding site. A recombinant form of CX, beginning at Met-1027, exhibits saturable binding to myosin with an affinity comparable to the C-terminal 13 kDa chymotryptic fragment of native MyBP-C. To identify the surface in CX involved in its interaction with myosin, nine site-directed mutants (R37E, K43E, N49D, E52R, D56K, R73E, R74E, G80D and R103E) were constructed. Using a new assay for assessing the binding of CX with the light meromyosin (LMM) portion of myosin, we demonstrate that recombinant CX, just as the full-length protein, is able to facilitate LMM polymerization. Moreover, we show that residues Arg-37, Glu-52, Asp-56, Arg-73, and Arg-74 are involved in this interaction with the myosin rod. All of these amino acids interact with negatively charged residues of LMM, since the mutants R37E, R73E and R74E are unable to bind myosin, whereas E52R and D56K bind myosin with higher affinity than wild-type CX. Residues Lys-43 and Arg-103 show a small but significant influence on the binding reaction; residues Asn-49 and Gly-80 seem not to be involved in this interaction. Based on these data, a model is proposed for the interaction between MyBP-C CX and myosin filaments. In this model, CX interacts with four molecules of LMM at four different sites of the binding protein, thus explaining the effects of MyBP-C on the critical concentration of myosin polymerization.

14679215|t|14-3-3beta binds to big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5) and regulates BMK1 function.
14679215|t|Big mitogen-activated kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5) is a member of the MAPK family activated by growth factors that mediates cell growth and survival. Previous data show that BMK1 can be activated by steady laminar flow and is atheroprotective by preventing endothelial cells from undergoing apoptosis. The primary structure of BMK1 is distinct from other MAPK members by virtue of a unique long C-tail, suggesting specific mechanisms of regulation. To characterize regulatory mechanisms for BMK1 function, we identified binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Among these proteins, the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 was identified. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3beta in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-14-3-3beta fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation of BMK1 was most likely required for this interaction. GST-14-3-3beta pull-down assays using truncated constructs of BMK1 and site-directed BMK1 mutants demonstrated that the interaction requires serine 486 within the C terminus of BMK1. BMK1 bound to 14-3-3beta basally, and the interaction was greatly abrogated when BMK1 was activated. The interaction of 14-3-3beta and BMK1 inhibited kinase activities stimulated by constitutively active (CA)-MEK5 and epidermal growth factor. Mutation of serine 486 (BMK1-S486A) prevented the interaction with 14-3-3beta and enhanced BMK1 activity upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. These data demonstrate an inhibitory function for 14-3-3beta binding to BMK1 and show that serine 486 phosphorylation represents a novel regulatory mechanism for BMK1.

Both mutations were found in the compound heterozygous state respectively with c.994+5G>T and c.232T>A (p.W78R). With the two-hybrid assay in the yeast system we found that constructs containing the two mutations fail to interact with the wild-type protein. These findings indicate that both mutations negatively affected the homodimerization properties of the AIRE protein, thereby leading to a defective function.

25703721|t|Differential dimerization of variants linked to enhanced S-cone sensitivity syndrome (ESCS) located in the NR2E3 ligand-binding domain.
25703721|t|NR2E3 encodes the photoreceptor-specific nuclear hormone receptor that acts as a repressor of cone-specific gene expression in rod photoreceptors, and as an activator of several rod-specific genes. Recessive variants located in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of NR2E3 cause enhanced short wavelength sensitive- (S-) cone syndrome (ESCS), a retinal degeneration characterized by an excess of S-cones and non-functional rods. We analyzed the dimerization properties of NR2E3 and the effect of disease-causing LBD missense variants by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET(2) ) protein interaction assays. Homodimerization was not affected in presence of p.A256V, p.R039G, p.R311Q, and p.R334G variants, but abolished in presence of p.L263P, p.L336P, p.L353V, p.R385P, and p.M407K variants. Homology modeling predicted structural changes induced by NR2E3 LBD variants. NR2E3 LBD variants did not affect interaction with CRX, but with NRL and rev-erbα/NR1D1. CRX and NRL heterodimerized more efficiently together, than did either with NR2E3. NR2E3 did not heterodimerize with TLX/NR2E1 and RXRα/NR2C1. The identification of a new compound heterozygous patient with detectable rod function, who expressed solely the p.A256V variant protein, suggests a correlation between LBD variants able to form functional NR2E3 dimers and atypical mild forms of ESCS with residual rod function.

24568842|t|Human biliverdin reductase-based peptides activate and inhibit glucose uptake through direct interaction with the kinase domain of insulin receptor.
24568842|t|Insulin binding changes conformation of the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) domain and initiates glucose uptake through the insulin, IGF-1, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and MAPK pathways; human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is an IRK substrate and pathway effector. This is the first report on hBVR peptide-mediated IRK activation and conformational change. (290)KYCCSRK, which increased IRK V(max) without changing K(m), stimulated glucose uptake and potentiated insulin and IGF-1 stimulation in 4 cell lines. KYCCSRK in native hBVR was necessary for the hBVR and IRK cross-activation. Peptide treatment also activated PI3K downstream effectors, Akt and ERK, phosphorylation, and Elk transcriptional activity. In cells transfected with CMV-regulated EGFP-VP-peptide plasmid, C(292)→A mutant did not stimulate glucose uptake; K(296)→A decreased uptake and kinase activity. KEDQYMKMTV, corresponding to hBVR's SH2-binding domain, was a potent inhibitor of glucose uptake and IRK. The mechanism of action of peptides was examined using cells expressing IRK (aa 988-1263) activated by coexpressed KYCCSRK. Three active cys-mutants of IRK, with fluorophore coupled to cysteines, C(1056), C(1138), or C(1234), were examined for changes in fluorescence emission spectra in the presence of peptides. KYCCSRK and KEDQYMKMTV bound to different sites in IRK. The findings identify novel agents for activating or inhibiting insulin signaling and offer a new approach for treatment of type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia.

Here we report that FGFR3 mutants activate Erk1/2 from the ER through an FRS2-independent pathway: instead, a multimeric complex by directly recruiting PLCgamma, Pyk2 and JAK1 is formed. The Erk1/2 activation from the ER however, is PLCgamma-independent, since preventing the PLCgamma/FGFR3 interaction by the Y754F substitution does not inhibit Erks. Furthermore, Erk1/2 activation is abrogated upon treatment with the Src inhibitor PP2, suggesting a role played by a Src family member in the pathway from the ER. Finally we show that the intrinsic kinase activity by mutant receptors is required to allow signaling from the ER. Overall these results highlight how activated FGFR3 exhibits signaling activity in the early phase of its biosynthesis and how segregation in a sub-cellular compartment can affect the FGFR3 multi-faceted capacity to recruit specific substrates.

12559036|t|CD2AP/CMS regulates endosome morphology and traffic to the degradative pathway through its interaction with Rab4 and c-Cbl.
12559036|t|The small GTPase Rab4 is involved in endocytosis through sorting and recycling early endosomes. To better understand the role of Rab4 in regulation of vesicular trafficking, we searched for effectors that specifically interact with Rab4-Q67L, the GTP-bound form of Rab4. We cloned an ubiquitous 80-kDa protein, identical to CD2-associated protein/Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains (CD2AP/CMS), that interacts with Rab4-Q67L in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. CD2AP/CMS expressed in mammalian cells was localized to punctate structures and along actin filaments. None of the known markers of early endosomes [Early Endosomes Antigen 1 (EEA1), Rab5 and Rab11] colocalized with the CD2AP/CMS-positive vesicles. However, coexpression of Rab4-Q67L with CD2AP/CMS induces a significant enlargement of EEA1-positive early endosomes. Rab4, CD2AP/CMS and Rab7 colocalized in these modified endosomes. Coexpression of c-Cbl and CD2AP/CMS also resulted in an enlargement of early endosomes. Using various truncated forms of CD2AP/CMS, we demonstrate that early endosomes enlargement requires that CD2AP/CMS interacts with both Rab4 and c-Cbl. The expression of a truncated form of CD2AP/CMS that retains the ability to interact with Rab4 but not c-Cbl inhibits ligand-induced PDGF receptor degradation. We propose that CD2AP/CMS, through interactions with Rab4 and c-Cbl, controls early endosome morphology and may play a role in traffic between early and late endosomes, and thus in the degradative pathway.

15855166|t|Identification of a cyclin T-binding domain in Hexim1 and biochemical analysis of its binding competition with HIV-1 Tat.
15855166|t|The active form of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) consists of cyclin T and the kinase Cdk9. P-TEFb stimulates transcription by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. It becomes inactivated when associated in a tetrameric complex with the abundant 7SK small nuclear RNA and the recently identified protein Hexim1. In this study, we identified a stable and soluble C-terminal domain (residues 255-359) in Hexim1 of 12.5-kDa size that binds the cyclin boxes of Cyclin T1. Functional assays in HeLa cells showed that this cyclin T-binding domain (TBD) is required for the binding of Hexim1 to P-TEFb and inhibition of transcriptional activity in vivo. Analytical gel filtration and GST pull-down experiments revealed that both full-length Hexim1 and the TBD are homodimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry yielded a weak multimer for the TBD with a multimerization constant of 1.3 x 10(3) m. The binding affinity between the TBD and cyclin T1 was analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy methods, using a dansyl-based fluorescence label at position G257C. Equilibrium fluorescence titration and stopped flow fast kinetics yield a dissociation constant of 1.2 mum. Finally, we tested the effect of the HIV-1 Tat protein on the cyclin T1-TBD complex formation. GST pull-down experiments and size exclusion chromatography exhibit a mutually exclusive binding of the two effectors to cyclin T1. Our data suggest a model where HIV-1 Tat competes with Hexim1 for cyclin T1 binding, thus releasing P-TEFb from the inactive complex to stimulate the transcription of HIV-1 gene expression.

9891077|t|p73 function is inhibited by tumor-derived p53 mutants in mammalian cells.
9891077|t|The p53 tumor suppressor protein, found mutated in over 50% of all human tumors, is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator. Recent studies have identified a p53 relative, termed p73. We were interested in determining the relative abilities of wild-type and mutant forms of p53 and p73alpha and -beta isoforms to transactivate various p53-responsive promoters. We show that both p73alpha and p73beta activate the transcription of reporters containing a number of p53-responsive promoters in the p53-null cell line H1299. However, a number of significant differences were observed between p53 and p73 and even between p73alpha and p73beta. Additionally, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based reporter assay revealed a broad array of transcriptional transactivation abilities by both p73 isoforms at 37 degreesC. Recent data have shown that p73 can associate with p53 by the yeast two-hybrid assay. When we examined complex formation in transfected mammalian cells, we found that p73alpha coprecipitates with mutant but not wild-type p53. Since many tumor-derived p53 mutants are capable of inhibiting transactivation by wild-type p53, we tested the effects of two representative hot-spot mutants (R175H and R248W) on p73. By cotransfecting p73alpha along with either p53 mutant and a p53-responsive reporter, we found that both R175H and R248W reduces the transcriptional activity of p73alpha. This decrease in transcriptional activity is correlated with the reduced ability of p73alpha to promote apoptosis in the presence of tumor-derived p53 mutants. Our data suggest the possibility that in some tumor cells, an outcome of the expression of mutant p53 protein may be to interfere with the endogenous p73 protein.

14645129|t|rigor mortis encodes a novel nuclear receptor interacting protein required for ecdysone signaling during Drosophila larval development.
14645129|t|Pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone trigger the major developmental transitions in Drosophila, including molting and puparium formation. The ecdysone signal is transduced by the EcR/USP nuclear receptor heterodimer that binds to specific response elements in the genome and directly regulates target gene transcription. We describe a novel nuclear receptor interacting protein encoded by rigor mortis (rig) that is required for ecdysone responses during larval development. rig mutants display defects in molting, delayed larval development, larval lethality, duplicated mouth parts, and defects in puparium formation--phenotypes that resemble those seen in EcR, usp, E75A and betaFTZ-F1 mutants. Although the expression of these nuclear receptor genes is essentially normal in rig mutant larvae, the ecdysone-triggered switch in E74 isoform expression is defective. rig encodes a protein with multiple WD-40 repeats and an LXXLL motif, sequences that act as specific protein-protein interaction domains. Consistent with the presence of these elements and the lethal phenotypes of rig mutants, Rig protein interacts with several Drosophila nuclear receptors in GST pull-down experiments, including EcR, USP, DHR3, SVP and betaFTZ-F1. The ligand binding domain of betaFTZ-F1 is sufficient for this interaction, which can occur in an AF-2-independent manner. Antibody stains reveal that Rig protein is present in the brain and imaginal discs of second and third instar larvae, where it is restricted to the cytoplasm. In larval salivary gland and midgut cells, however, Rig shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a spatially and temporally regulated manner, at times that correlate with the major lethal phase of rig mutants and major switches in ecdysone-regulated gene expression. Taken together, these data indicate that rig exerts essential functions during larval development through gene-specific effects on ecdysone-regulated transcription, most likely as a cofactor for one or more nuclear receptors. Furthermore, the dynamic intracellular redistribution of Rig protein suggests that it may act to refine spatial and temporal responses to ecdysone during development.

15033987|t|N-terminal region of FKBP12 is essential for binding to the skeletal ryanodine receptor.
15033987|t|It is known that the two types of FK506-binding proteins FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 are tightly associated with the skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2), respectively, and their interactions are important for channel functions of the RyR. In the case of cardiac muscle, three amino acid residues (Gln-31, Asn-32, and Phe-59) of FKBP12.6 could be essential for the selective binding to RyR2 (Xin, H. B., Rogers, K., Qi, Y., Kanematsu, T., and Fleischer, S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15315-15319). In this study to identify amino acid residues of FKBP12 that are important for the selective binding to RyR1, we mutated 9 amino acid residues of FKBP12 that differ from the counterparts of FKBP12.6 (Q3E, R18A, E31Q, D32N, M49R, R57A, W59F, H94A, and K105A), and we examined binding properties of these mutants to RyR1 by in vitro binding assay by using glutathione S-transferase-fused proteins of the mutants and Triton X-100-solubilized, FKBP12-depleted rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Among the nine mutants tested, only Q3E and R18A lost their selective binding ability to RyR1. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of RyR1 with 33 various mutants for the 9 positions produced by introducing different size, charge, and hydrophobicity revealed that an integration of the hydrogen bonds by the irreplaceable Gln-3 and the hydrophobic interactions by the residues Arg-18 and Met-49 could be a possible mechanism for the binding of FKBP12 to RyR1. Therefore, these results suggest that the N-terminal regions of FKBP12 (Gln-3 and Arg-18) and Met-49 are essential and unique for binding of FKBP12 to RyR1 in skeletal muscle.

9712735|t|Several noncontiguous domains of CDK4 are involved in binding to the P16 tumor suppressor protein.
9712735|t|Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a key molecule in the regulation of cell cycle progression at the G1-S phase restriction point. Its activity is specifically regulated by p16 (also known as p16/CDKN2A, p16(INK4a), and MTS1), a tumor suppressor frequently altered in human cancers. A specific mutation in CDK4 codon 24 (Arginine to Cysteine) prevents p16 binding and thus inhibition by p16. This mutated CDK4 acts as a dominant oncogene and has been found in both sporadic and familial melanoma. To study the effects of other mutations in CDK4, we generated a panel of 18 CDK4 mutants using Charged-to-Alanine scanning mutagenesis, and investigated the p16-binding capacity of these mutants to identify novel sites involved in p16 binding. The mutant CDK4 proteins were generated by direct coupled transcription-translation in vitro and tested for binding to p16 using a p16-GST fusion protein. Several mutants demonstrated loss of p16 binding. In addition to the previously identified codon 24 mutants, alterations in and around codon 22, 25, 97, and 281 all showed loss of p16 binding capacity. These results indicate that several noncontiguous amino acid sequences on CDK4 are required for binding to p16, which suggests the existence of multiple sites of interaction with p16. Since p16-binding deficient CDK4 has oncogenic potential, these mutations may be present in melanomas or other human neoplasms.

26407691|t|Modulating platelet reactivity through control of RGS18 availability.
26407691|t|Most platelet agonists activate platelets by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. We have shown previously that a critical node in the G-protein signaling network in platelets is formed by a scaffold protein, spinophilin (SPL), the tyrosine phosphatase, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), and the regulator of G-protein signaling family member, RGS18. Here, we asked whether SPL and other RGS18 binding proteins such as 14-3-3γ regulate platelet reactivity by sequestering RGS18 and, if so, how this is accomplished. The results show that, in resting platelets, free RGS18 levels are relatively low, increasing when platelets are activated by thrombin. Free RGS18 levels also rise when platelets are rendered resistant to activation by exposure to prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) or forskolin, both of which increase platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. However, the mechanism for raising free RGS18 is different in these 2 settings. Whereas thrombin activates SHP-1 and causes dephosphorylation of SPL tyrosine residues, PGI2 and forskolin cause phosphorylation of SPL Ser94 without reducing tyrosine phosphorylation. Substituting alanine for Ser94 blocks cAMP-induced dissociation of the SPL/RGS/SHP-1 complex. Replacing Ser94 with aspartate prevents formation of the complex and produces a loss-of-function phenotype when expressed in mouse platelets. Together with the defect in platelet function we previously observed in SPL(-/-) mice, these data show that (1) regulated sequestration and release of RGS18 by intracellular binding proteins provides a mechanism for coordinating activating and inhibitory signaling networks in platelets, and (2) differential phosphorylation of SPL tyrosine and serine residues provides a key to understanding both.

12400015|t|Direct interaction between BRCA1 and the estrogen receptor regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription and secretion in breast cancer cells.
12400015|t|Mutational inactivation of BRCA1 confers increased risk for breast cancer. However, the underlying basis for the breast tissue-restricted, tumor-suppressive properties of BRCA1 remains poorly defined. Here, we show that BRCA1 and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) modulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription and secretion in breast cancer cells. ER-alpha interacted in vitro and in vivo with BRCA1, and this interaction was mediated by the AF-2 domain of ER-alpha and two domains of BRCA1, the amino-acid residues 1-306 and 428-683. Endogenous interaction of ER-alpha with BRCA1 was observed in normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells and in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D), and this interaction was significantly reduced in the presence of estrogen. Furthermore, ER-alpha induced activation of VEGF gene transcription, using human VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. The AF-2 domain of ER-alpha was also shown to induce VEGF gene transcription activation similar to that obtained with the full-length ER-alpha. However, in the presence of BRCA1, VEGF gene transcription activation and VEGF protein secretion were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The BRCA1 domain of 1-683 amino acid residues was required for this inhibition of VEGF gene transcription activation. Three mutated forms of BRCA1 (A1708E, M1775R and Y1853X), that have been identified in familial breast cancers, failed to associate with ER-alpha and to suppress VEGF promoter activity and VEGF protein secretion. Overexpression of wild-type BRCA1 in HCC-1937 breast cancer cells that lack endogenous functional BRCA1 significantly reduced VEGF secretion in these cells. These results demonstrate a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby mutations in BRCA1, via their interaction with ER-alpha, could promote tumorigenesis through the hormonal regulation of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and impaired VEGF function, which may lead to cancer growth and angiogenesis.

11172034|t|p53 associates with and targets Delta Np63 into a protein degradation pathway.
11172034|t|A human p53 homologue, p63 (p40/p51/p73L/CUSP) that maps to the chromosomal region 3q27-29 was found to produce a variety of transcripts that encode DNA-binding proteins with and without a trans-activation domain (TA- or Delta N-, respectively). The p63 gene locus was found to be amplified in squamous cell carcinoma, and overexpression of Delta Np63 (p40) led to increased growth of transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, p63-null mice displayed abnormal epithelial development and germ-line human mutations were found to cause ectodermal dysplasia. We now demonstrate that certain p63 isotypes form complexes with p53. p53 mutations R175H or R248W abolish the association of p53 with p63, whereas V143A or R273H has no effect. Deletion studies suggest that the DNA-binding domains of both p53 and p63 mediate the association. Overexpression of wild type but not mutant (R175H) p53 results in the caspase-dependent degradation of certain Delta Np63 proteins (p40 and Delta Np63 alpha). The association between p53 and Delta Np63 supports a previously unrecognized role for p53 in regulation of Delta Np63 stability. The ability of p53 to mediate Delta Np63 degradation may balance the capacity of Delta Np63 to accelerate tumorigenesis or to induce epithelial proliferation.

9751730|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) binds to VEGF receptor-1 and regulates plasminogen activator activity in endothelial cells.
9751730|t|The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family has recently expanded by the identification and cloning of three additional members, namely VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. In this study we demonstrate that VEGF-B binds selectively to VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1. This binding can be blocked by excess VEGF, indicating that the interaction sites on the receptor are at least partially overlapping. Mutating the putative VEGF receptor-1/Flt-1 binding determinants Asp63, Asp64, and Glu67 to alanine residues in VEGF-B reduced the affinity to VEGF receptor-1 but did not abolish binding. Mutational analysis of conserved cysteines contributing to VEGF-B dimer formation suggest a structural conservation with VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor. Proteolytic processing of the 60-kDa VEGF-B186 dimer results in a 34-kDa dimer containing the receptor-binding epitopes. The binding of VEGF-B to its receptor on endothelial cells leads to increased expression and activity of urokinase type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, suggesting a role for VEGF-B in the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation, cell adhesion, and migration.

7908733|t|Kinase-deficient neu proteins suppress epidermal growth factor receptor function and abolish cell transformation.
7908733|t|p185c-neu and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) associate into an active heterodimer, and overexpression of these two receptors leads to a transformed phenotype. However, the association of EGFR and kinase-deficient Neu proteins (point mutant N757 or cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant N691stop) results in a defective or inactive heterodimeric complex. In this report we explore the biological consequences of heterodimerization between EGFR and wild-type (WT) or kinase-deficient mutant Neu proteins in living cells. We show that co-expression of EGFR and kinase-deficient Neu proteins abolished the synergistic transformation and tumorigenicity. Moreover, the normal responses of EGFR to ligand were significantly suppressed, e.g., loss of EGF-dependent transformation, reduced rate of receptor endocytosis and turnover, diminished DNA synthesis, and decreased EGF binding affinity. These results provide the first evidence that kinase-deficient Neu proteins suppress normal EGFR function and display a dominant negative mutant phenotype. Together with the stimulatory effects observed in cells forming active heterodimers, these studies provide a role for heterodimerization of EGFR and Neu/c-erbB2 in interreceptor activation and synergistic signaling which may be responsible for the transition from normal receptor function into oncogenesis.

11602604|t|RGS16 function is regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.
11602604|t|Galpha(i)-coupled receptor stimulation results in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and MAPK activation. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) inhibit G protein-dependent signal transduction by accelerating Galpha(i) GTP hydrolysis, shortening the duration of G protein effector stimulation. RGS16 contains two conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box, Tyr(168) and Tyr(177), which are predicted sites of phosphorylation. RGS16 underwent phosphorylation in response to m2 muscarinic receptor or EGFR stimulation in HEK 293T or COS-7 cells, which required EGFR kinase activity. Mutational analysis suggested that RGS16 was phosphorylated on both tyrosine residues (Tyr(168) Tyr(177)) after EGF stimulation. RGS16 co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR, and the interaction did not require EGFR activation. Purified EGFR phosphorylated only recombinant RGS16 wild-type or Y177F in vitro, implying that EGFR-mediated phosphorylation depended on residue Tyr(168). Phosphorylated RGS16 demonstrated enhanced GTPase accelerating (GAP) activity on Galpha(i). Mutation of Tyr(168) to phenylalanine resulted in a 30% diminution in RGS16 GAP activity but completely eliminated its ability to regulate G(i)-mediated MAPK activation or adenylyl cyclase inhibition in HEK 293T cells. In contrast, mutation of Tyr(177) to phenylalanine had no effect on RGS16 GAP activity but also abolished its regulation of G(i)-mediated signal transduction in these cells. These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates RGS16 function and that EGFR may potentially inhibit Galpha(i)-dependent MAPK activation in a feedback loop by enhancing RGS16 activity through tyrosine phosphorylation.

11940572|t|ErbB-2 activates Stat3 alpha in a Src- and JAK2-dependent manner.
11940572|t|Stats (signal transducer and activator of transcription) are latent transcription factors that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Constitutive activation of Stat3 alpha by upstream oncoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases has been found in many human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. Constitutively activated Stat3 alpha is often correlated with the activation of ErbB-2, a member of the EGFR family. To explore the involvement of ErbB-2 in the activation of Stat3 and the mechanism underlying this event, an ErbB-2 point mutant was used as a model of constitutively activated receptor. Phenylalanine mutations (Y-->F) were made in the autophosphorylation sites of the receptor, and their ability to activate Stat3 alpha was evaluated. Our results suggest that Stat3 alpha and JAK2 associates with ErbB-2 prior to phosphorylation of the receptor and that full activation of Stat3 alpha by ErbB-2 requires the participation of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Both Src and Jak2 kinases contribute to the activation of Stat3 alpha but Src binds to ErbB-2 only when the receptor is phosphorylated. Our results also suggest that tyrosine 1139 may be important for Src homology 2 domain association because a mutant lacking this tyrosine reduces the ability of the Src homology 2 domain to bind to ErbB-2 and significantly decreases its ability to activate Stat3 alpha.

11162493|t|Involvement of residues 147VYYEIGK153 in binding of lethal factor to protective antigen of Bacillus anthracis.
11162493|t|Anthrax toxin is a complex of protective antigen (PA, 735 aa), lethal factor (LF, 776 aa), and edema factor (EF, 767 aa). PA binds to cell surface receptors and is cleaved by cell surface proteases into PA63, while LF and EF compete for binding to PA63. The PA63-LF/EF complex is internalized into the cytosol and causes different pathogenic responses in animals and cultured cells. 1-300 amino acid residues of LF have been viewed as the region responsible for the high affinity binding of LF to PA. Amino acid analysis of LF and EF revealed a common stretch of 7 amino acids (147VYYEIGK153). In the present study, each amino acid of this stretch was replaced by alanine at a time. Y148A, Y149A, I151A, and K153A mutants were found to be deficient in their ability to lyse J774A.1 cells and their binding ability to PA63 was drastically reduced. We propose that these four amino acids play a crucial role in the process of binding of LF to PA63.

9525869|t|Interactions between the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor or RyR1) and the loop linking domains II and III (II-III loop) of the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR) are critical for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. The DHPR II-III loop was fused to glutathione S-transferase- or His-peptide and used as a protein affinity column for 35S-labeled in vitro translated fragments from the N-terminal three-fourths of RyR1. RyR1 residues Leu922-Asp1112 bound specifically to the DHPR II-III loop column, but the corresponding fragment from the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) did not. The use of chimeras between RyR1 and RyR2 localized the interaction to 37 amino acids, Arg1076-Asp1112, in RyR1. The RyR1 922-1112 fragment did not bind to the cardiac DHPR II-III loop but did bind to the skeletal muscle Na+ channel II-III loop. The skeletal DHPR II-III loop double mutant K677E/K682E lost most of its capacity to interact with RyR1, suggesting that two positively charged residues are important in the interaction between RyR and DHPR.

However, this interaction and its consequence in cancer treatments are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ZBP‑89 is essentially required in HDACi-mediated p21 upregulation in hepetocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of ZBP-89 protein enhanced the lethal effectiveness of Trichostatin A (TSA). p53 mutant p53(G245D), but not p53(R249S), directly bound to ZBP-89 and prevented its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus. Furthermore, p53(G245D) was shown to have a similar pattern of subcellular localization to ZBP-89 in tissues of HCC patients in Hong Kong. Functionally, the cytoplasmic accumulation of ZBP-89 by p53(G245D) significantly abrogated the induction of p21 caused by sodium butyrate (NaB) treatment and protected cells from TSA-induced death. The activations of several apoptotic proteins, such as Bid and PARP, were involved in p53(G245D)-mediated protection. Moreover, the resistance to HDACi in p53(G245D)-expressing cells was reversed by overexpression of ZBP-89. Taken together, these data suggest a potential mechanism via which mutant p53 enables tumor cells to resist chemotherapy and, therefore, establish a plausible link between mutant p53 binding to ZBP-89 and a decreased chemosensitivity of HCC cells.

9506989|t|Grb10 interacts differentially with the insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor I receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor via the Grb10 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and a second novel domain located between the pleckstrin homology and SH2 domains.
9506989|t|The Grb10 protein appears to be an adapter protein of unknown function that has been implicated in insulin receptor (IR) signaling. The interaction of this protein with the IR has been shown to be mediated in part by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Grb10. Here we demonstrate the existence of a second novel domain within Grb10 that interacts with the IR and insulin-like growth factor receptor in a kinase-dependent manner. This domain was localized to a region of approximately 50 amino acids, and we term it the BPS domain to denote its location between the PH and SH2 domains. The BPS domain does not bear any obvious resemblance to other known protein interaction domains but is highly conserved among the Grb10-related proteins Grb7 and Grb14. We show that the BPS domain interaction is dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, interaction of the BPS domain requires the kinase domain of the IR, since mutation of the paired tyrosine residues (Y1150F/Y1151F) within the IR activation loop dramatically reduced the interaction. Last, our data suggest that the presence of two distinct protein interaction domains may help to determine the specificity by which Grb10 interacts with different receptors. Specifically, the IR, which appears to interact most strongly with Grb10, interacts well with both the SH2 and BPS domains. Conversely, the insulin-like growth factor receptor and EGFR, which interact less avidly with Grb10, interact well only with the BPS domain or the SH2 domain, respectively. In summary, our findings demonstrate the existence of a previously unidentified tyrosine kinase activity-dependent binding domain located between the Pleckstrin homology and SH2 domains of Grb10.

19015526|t|ATM-mediated serine 72 phosphorylation stabilizes ribonucleotide reductase small subunit p53R2 protein against MDM2 to DNA damage.
19015526|t|Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit p53R2 was identified as a p53 target gene that provides dNTP for DNA damage repair. However, the slow transcriptional induction of p53R2 in RNA may not be rapid enough for prompt DNA damage repair, which has to occur within a few hours of damage. Here, we demonstrate that p53R2 becomes rapidly phosphorylated at Ser(72) by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) within 30 min after genotoxic stress. p53R2, as well as its heterodimeric partner RRM1, are associated with ATM in vivo. Mutational studies further indicate that ATM-mediated Ser(72) phosphorylation is essential for maintaining p53R2 protein stability and conferring resistance to DNA damage. The mutation of Ser(72) on p53R2 to alanine results in the hyperubiquitination of p53R2 and reduces p53R2 stability. MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, interacts and facilitates ubiquitination of the S72A-p53R2 mutant more efficiently than WT-p53R2 after DNA damage in vivo. Our results strongly suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of p53R2 activity via ATM-mediated phosphorylation at Ser(72) and MDM2-dependent turnover of p53R2 dephosphorylated at the same residue.

10202144|t|Critical role for Ser20 of human p53 in the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2.
10202144|t|In response to environmental stress, the p53 phosphoprotein is stabilized and activated to inhibit cell growth. p53 stability and activity are negatively regulated by the murine double minute (Mdm2) oncoprotein in an autoregulatory feedback loop. The inhibitory effect of Mdm2 on p53 has to be tightly regulated for proper p53 activity. Phosphorylation is an important level of p53 regulation. In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated at several N-terminal serines. In this study we examined the role of Ser20, a potential phosphorylation site in human p53, in the regulation of p53 stability and function. Substitution of Ser20 by Ala (p53-Ala20) significantly increases the susceptibility of human p53 to negative regulation by Mdm2 in vivo, as measured by apoptosis and transcription activation assays. Mutation of Ser20 to Ala renders p53 less stable and more prone to Mdm2-mediated degradation. While the in vitro binding of p53 to Mdm2 is not increased by the Ala20 mutation, the same mutation results in a markedly enhanced binding in vivo. This is consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of Ser20 in vivo attenuates the binding of wild-type p53 to Mdm2. Peptides bearing non-phosphorylated Ser20 or Ala20 compete with p53 for Mdm2 binding, while a similar peptide with phosphorylated Ser20 does not. This implies a critical role for Ser20 in modulating the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2, probably through phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of p53-Mdm2 interaction.

23086950|t|Identification of functionally critical residues in the channel domain of inositol trisphosphate receptors.
23086950|t|We have combined alanine mutagenesis and functional assays to identify amino acid residues in the channel domain that are critical for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) channel function. The residues selected were highly conserved in all three IP(3)R isoforms and were located in the cytosolic end of the S6 pore-lining helix and proximal portion of the C-tail. Two adjacent hydrophobic amino acids (Ile-2588 and Ile-2589) at the putative cytosolic interface of the S6 helix inactivated channel function and could be candidates for the channel gate. Of five negatively charged residues mutated, none completely eliminated channel function. Of five positively charged residues mutated, only one inactivated the channel (Arg-2596). In addition to the previously identified role of a pair of cysteines in the C-tail (Cys-2610 and Cys-2613), a pair of highly conserved histidines (His-2630 and His-2635) were also essential for channel function. Expression of the H2630A and H2635A mutants (but not R2596A) produced receptors with destabilized interactions between the N-terminal fragment and the channel domain. A previously unrecognized association between the cytosolic C-tail and the TM 4,5-loop was demonstrated using GST pulldown assays. However, none of the mutations in the C-tail interfered with this interaction or altered the ability of the C-tail to assemble into dimers. Our present findings and recent information on IP(3)R structure from electron microscopy and crystallography are incorporated into a revised model of channel gating.

9671495|t|Structure-function analysis of Qk1: a lethal point mutation in mouse quaking prevents homodimerization.
9671495|t|Qk1 is a member of the KH domain family of proteins that includes Sam68, GRP33, GLD-1, SF1, and Who/How. These family members are RNA binding proteins that contain an extended KH domain embedded in a larger domain called the GSG (for GRP33-Sam68-GLD-1) domain. An ethylnitrosourea-induced point mutation in the Qk1 GSG domain alters glutamic acid 48 to a glycine and is known to be embryonically lethal in mice. The function of Qk1 and the GSG domain as well as the reason for the lethality are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the Qk1 GSG domain mediates RNA binding and Qk1 self-association. By using in situ chemical cross-linking studies, we showed that the Qk1 proteins exist as homodimers in vivo. The Qk1 self-association region was mapped to amino acids 18 to 57, a region predicted to form coiled coils. Alteration of glutamic acid 48 to glycine (EG) in the Qk1 GSG domain (producing protein Qk1:EG) abolishes self-association but has no effect on the RNA binding activity. The expression of Qk1 or Qk1:EG in NIH 3T3 cells induces cell death by apoptosis. Approximately 90% of the remaining transfected cells are apoptotic 48 h after transfection. Qk1:EG was consistently more potent at inducing apoptosis than was wild-type Qk1. These results suggest that the mouse quaking lethality (EG) occurs due to the absence of Qk1 self-association mediated by the GSG domain.

12137565|t|Translation initiation at non-AUG codons mediated by weakened association of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 subunits.
12137565|t|The heterotrimeric eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 binds the initiator methionyl-tRNA in a GTP-dependent mode and delivers it to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In the present study, we have identified amino acid residues in eIF2beta required for binding to eIF2gamma in yeast. Alteration of six residues in the central region of eIF2beta abolished this interaction, as determined by GST-pull down and two-hybrid assays, and leads to cell lethality. Substitution of (131)Tyr and (132)Ser by alanine residues ((131)YS), although abolishing the binding to eIF2gamma in these assays, resulted in a functional but defective protein in vivo, imparting a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype to cells. A dramatically weakened association of this mutant protein with eIF2gamma in vivo was shown by co-immunoprecipitation. The (131)YS mutation in eIF2beta allows translation to initiate at non-AUG codons, as defined by the ability of cells carrying an initiator codon mutation in the HIS4 mRNA to grow in the absence of histidine. The combination of this mutation with the (264)Ser-->Tyr alteration, a previously isolated suppressor of initiator codon mutations which has been shown to increase the spontaneous GTP hydrolysis in the ternary complex, caused a recessive lethality, suggesting additive defects. Thus the impaired interaction of these two subunits represents a novel type of defect in eIF2 function, providing in vivo evidence that the strength of interaction between eIF2beta and eIF2gamma defines the correct usage of the AUG codon for translation initiation.

19020088|t|Interaction of brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 and kinesin motor protein KIF21A.
19020088|t|Brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (BIG) 1 activates human ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 1 and 3 by accelerating the replacement of ARF-bound GDP with GTP to initiate recruitment of coat proteins for membrane vesicle formation. Liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis of peptides from proteins that co-precipitated with BIG1 antibodies identified "kinesin family member 21A" (KIF21A), a plus-end-directed motor protein that moves cargo on microtubules away from the microtubule-organizing center. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous proteins and microscopically apparent overlap of immunoreactive BIG1 with overexpressed GFP-KIF21A in the perinuclear region were consistent with an interaction of KIF21A-BIG1. Overexpression of full-length KIF21A and BIG1 and their fragments in HEK293 cells followed by reciprocal IP revealed that the C-terminal tail of KIF21A, with seven WD-40 repeats, may interact with structure in the C-terminal region of BIG1. Interfering with cyclic activation and inactivation of ARF1 by overexpressing constitutively active ARF1(Q71L) or dominant inactive ARF1(T31N) altered the distribution of BIG1 as well as its interaction with KIF21A. A requirement for ARF1 was confirmed by its selective depletion with siRNA. Unlike disruption of microtubules with nocodazole, selective inhibition of transport by depletion of KIF21A with specific siRNA altered BIG1 distribution without changing that of intrinsic Golgi membrane proteins. These newly recognized interactions of BIG1 and KIF21A should enable us to understand better the mechanisms through which, acting together, they may integrate local events in membrane trafficking with longer-range transport processes and to relate those processes to the diverse signaling and scaffold functions of BIG1.

26149501|t|Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase γ by Akt regulates its interaction with talin and focal adhesion dynamics.
26149501|t|The type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) family members and their lipid product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are important regulators of actin cytoskeleton. PIP5Kγ 90kDa (PIP5Kγ90), an isoform of PIP5K, localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) and is activated via its interaction with the cytoskeletal protein, talin. Currently, regulatory signaling pathways of talin-PIP5Kγ90 interaction related to FA dynamics and cell motility are not well understood. Considering the presence of Akt consensus motifs in PIP5Kγ90, we examined a potential link of Akt activation to talin-PIP5Kγ90 interaction. We found that Akt phosphorylated PIP5Kγ90 specifically at serine 555 (S555) in vitro and in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependently. EGF treatment suppressed talin-PIP5Kγ90 interaction and PIP2 levels. Similarly, a phosphomimetic mutant (S555D), but not non-phosphorylatable mutant (S555A), of PIP5Kγ90 had reduced talin binding affinity, lowered PIP2 levels, and was dislocated from FAs. The S555D mutant also caused decreases in actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive FAs. Moreover, assembly and disassembly of FAs were enhanced by S555D expression and EGF-induced cell migration was relatively low in S555A-expressing cells compared to wild-type-expressing cells. PIP5Kγ87, a PIP5Kγ splice variant lacking the talin binding motif, was phosphorylated by Akt, which, however, hardly affected PIP2 levels. Taken together, our results suggested that Akt-mediated PIP5Kγ90 S555 phosphorylation is a novel regulatory point for talin binding to control PIP2 level at the FAs, thereby modulating FA dynamics and cell motility.

16519964|t|Evidence for serum-deprivation-induced co-release of FGF-1 and S100A13 from astrocytes.
16519964|t|Since fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 lacks conventional amino-terminal signal peptide essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway, the mode of release of this polypeptide remains to be fully understood. We attempted to characterize the non-classical (non-vesicular) mode of FGF-1 release in the analyses using immunocytochemistry and immunoblot of conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes. FGF-1 was completely released from astrocytes upon serum-deprivation stress in a Brefeldin A-insensitive manner. In the immunoprecipitation study using anti-FGF-1 IgG, S100A13 was identified to be the major protein co-eluted with FGF-1. The interaction between GST-FGF-1 and Strep-tag II-S100A13 was found to be Ca(2+)-sensitive, and to require the C-terminal 11 amino acid peptide sequence of S100A13. The overexpression of Delta88-98 mutant of S100A13 selectively inhibited the serum-deprivation stress-induced release of FGF-1, but not the release of S100A13 mutant from C6 glioma cells. However, amlexanox, anti-allergic drug whose target is S100A13, completely inhibited the stress-induced release of FGF-1 as well as S100A13. The stress-induced release of both proteins was also abolished by BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agent. The serum-deprivation caused Ca(2+) spikes in omega-conotoxin GVIA and thapsigargin-sensitive manner. All these results suggest that S100A13 is a cargo molecule for the serum-deprivation stress-induced non-classical release of FGF-1, and that its driving force of protein-protein interaction and release is possibly mediated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) coupled to N-type Ca(2+) channel activity.

9099695|t|Identification of the autophosphorylation sites of the Xenopus laevis Pim-1 proto-oncogene-encoded protein kinase.
9099695|t|Pim-1 is an oncogene-encoded serine/threonine kinase expressed primarily in cells of the hematopoietic and germ line lineages. Previously identified only in mammals, pim-1 cDNA was cloned and sequenced from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. The coding region of Xenopus pim-1 encoded a protein of 324 residues, which exhibited 64% amino acid identity with the full-length human cognate. Xenopus Pim-1 was expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and in COS cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that recombinant Pim-1 autophosphorylated on serine and threonine and to a more limited extent on tyrosine. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy was undertaken to locate these phosphorylation sites, and the primary autophosphorylation site of GST-Pim-1 was identified as Ser-190 with Thr-205 and Ser-4 being minor sites. Ser-190, which immediately follows the high conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif in catalytic subdomain VII, is also featured in more than 20 other protein kinases. To evaluate the importance of the Ser-190 site on the phosphotransferase activity of Pim-1, Ser-190 was mutated to either alanine or glutamic acid, and the constructs were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and in COS cells. These mutants confirmed that Ser-190 is a major autophosphorylation site of Pim-1 and indicated that phosphorylation of Pim-1 on the Ser-190 residue may serve to activate this kinase.

20029648|t|Trimethylamine N-oxide alleviates the severe aggregation and ER stress caused by G98R alphaA-crystallin.
20029648|t|PURPOSE: Crystallins are major functional and structural proteins in mammalian lens. Their expression, distribution, and protein-protein interaction affect lens development and fiber cell differentiation. Mutated crystallins lead to structural and functional changes of lens structure and could lead to opacity formation and cataract development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological effects of the cataract-causing G98R mutation on the alphaA-crystallin (CRYAA) protein and to test the capability of chemical chaperone trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to reverse such effects. METHODS: Myc/His-tagged, human, full-length, wild-type (WT) or G98R CRYAA was expressed in human lens epithelial B3 cells and treated or not treated with TMAO. Triton X-100 (Tx) solubility and cellular localization of CRYAA were examined by western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence, respectively. Ubiquitin proteasome-associated degradation was assayed by MG132 treatment. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response, and apoptosis were analyzed by the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER-kinase, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP/GADD153), and caspase-3 and immunocytochemistry. Changes in heat shock and stress signaling were investigated. RESULTS: When transfected in lens epithelial B3 cells, unlike WT CRYAA located in the cytoplasm, the G98R CRYAA mutant formed aggregates inside the ER and the protein was predominantly Tx-insoluble. ER stress was induced by G98R CRYAA expression, and cells underwent apoptosis, as shown by a more frequent appearance of fragmented nuclei. Treatment with TMAO reduced Tx-insoluble mutant protein in time- and dose-dependent manners. Other chemical chaperones, 4-phenylbutyric acid, dimethysulfoxide, and glycerol, were much less effective than TMAO. ER-associated aggregates were reduced after TMAO treatment, and the protein was degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This alleviated ER stress and resulted in less apoptosis. Moreover, TMAO treatment induced a moderate upregulation of heat shock protein 70, indicating its effect on heat-shock response to modulate protein folding and assembly. No change was found for nontransfected cells after TMAO treatment. CONCLUSION: The natural osmolyte and chemical chaperone TMAO reduced the aggregation of G98R CRYAA. This alleviated ER stress and rescued the affected cells from apoptosis. Our results showed that the chemical chaperone reduces mutant CRYAA aggregates in lens cells. We suggest a potential chemical-based strategy to reduce lens opacity formation.

17939682|t|Design, synthesis, and evaluation of linear and cyclic peptide ligands for PDZ10 of the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1.
17939682|t|PDZ10 is the 10th of 13 PDZ domains found within MUPP1, a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein first identified as an endogenous binding partner of serotonin receptor type 2c (5HT2c). This association, as with those of several other interacting proteins that have subsequently been identified, is mediated through the C-terminal tail of the PDZ domain partner. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we measured the thermodynamic binding parameters [changes in Gibbs free energy (DeltaG), enthalpy (DeltaH) and entropy (TDeltaS)] of the isolated PDZ10 domain for variable-length N-acetylated peptides from the 5HT2c serotonin receptor C-terminal sequence, as well as for octapeptides of eight other putative partner proteins of PDZ10 (5HT2a, hc-kit, hTapp1, mTapp2, TARP, NG2, claudin-1, and HPV-18 E6). In length dependence studies of the 5HT2c sequence, the maximal affinity of the peptides leveled off rapidly and further elongation did not significantly improve the dissociation constant (Kd) of 11 microM observed with the pentapeptide. Among the native partners of PDZ10, octapeptides derived from the hc-kit and 5HT2c proteins were the strongest binders, with Kd values of 5.2 and 8.5 microM, respectively. The heat capacity change (DeltaCp) for the 5HT2c octapeptide was determined to be -94 cal/mol, and a calculated estimate indicates burial of polar and apolar surface areas in equal measure upon ligand binding. Peptides with phosphoserine at either the P-1 or P-2 position experienced decreased affinity, which is in accord with the hypothesis that reversible phosphorylation is a possible mechanism for regulating PDZ domain-mediated interactions. Additionally, two conformationally constrained side chain-bridged cyclic peptide ligands were also designed, prepared, evaluated by ITC, and shown to bind PDZ10 primarily through a favorable change in entropy.

14676211|t|Catalytic activity of human ADAM33.
14676211|t|ADAM33 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) is an asthma susceptibility gene recently identified through a genetic study of asthmatic families (van Eerdewegh et al. (2002) Nature 418, 426-430). In order to characterize the catalytic properties of ADAM33, the metalloproteinase domain of human ADAM33 was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells and purified. The N-terminal sequence of the purified metalloproteinase was exclusively (204)EARR, indicating utilization of one of three furin recognition sites. Of many synthetic peptides tested as potential substrates, four peptides derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Kit-ligand-1 (KL-1), tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine, and insulin B chain were cleaved by ADAM33; mutation at the catalytic site, E346A, inactivated catalytic activity. Cleavage of APP occurred at His(14)/Gln(15), not at the alpha-secretase site and was inefficient (k(cat)/K(m) (1.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(2) m(-1) s(-1)). Cleavage of a juxtamembrane KL-1 peptide occurred at a site used physiologically with a similar efficiency. Mutagenesis of KL-1 peptide substrate indicated that the P3, P2, P1, and P3' residues were critical for activity. In a transfected cell-based sheddase assay, ADAM33 functioned as a negative regulator of APP shedding and mediated some constitutive shedding of KL-1, which was not regulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation. ADAM33 activity was sensitive to several hydroxamate inhibitors (IK682, K(i) = 23 +/- 7 nm) and to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs). Activity was inhibited moderately by TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 and weakly inhibited by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1, a profile distinct from other ADAMs. The identification of ADAM33 peptide substrates, cellular activity, and a distinct inhibitor profile provide the basis for further functional studies of ADAM33.

9326658|t|Binding of high-risk human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins to the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein.
9326658|t|In the majority of cervical cancers, DNAs of high-risk mucosotpropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as type 16, are maintained so as to express two viral proteins, E6 and E7, suggesting an essential importance to carcinogenesis. The high-risk HPV E6 proteins are known to inactivate p53 tumor suppressor protein but appear to have an additional, molecularly unknown function(s). In this study, we demonstrate that these E6 proteins can bind to the second PDZ domain of the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDLG) through their C-terminal XS/TXV/L (where X represents any amino acid, S/T serine or threonine, and V/L valine or leucine) motif. This finding is similar to the interaction between the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product and hDLG. E6 mutants losing the ability to bind to hDLG are no longer able to induce E6-dependent transformation of rodent cells. These results suggest an intriguing possibility that interaction between the E6 protein and hDLG or other PDZ domain-containing proteins could be an underlying mechanism in the development of HPV-associated cancers.

26164367|t|Distinctive malfunctions of calmodulin mutations associated with heart RyR2-mediated arrhythmic disease.
26164367|t|Calmodulin (CaM) is a cytoplasmic calcium sensor that interacts with the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), a large Ca(2+) channel complex that mediates Ca(2+) efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to activate cardiac muscle contraction. Direct CaM association with RyR2 is an important physiological regulator of cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling and defective CaM-RyR2 protein interaction has been reported in cases of heart failure. Recent genetic studies have identified CaM missense mutations in patients with a history of severe cardiac arrhythmogenic disorders that present divergent clinical features, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT syndrome (LQTS) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). Herein, we describe how two CPVT- (N54I & N98S) and three LQTS-associated (D96V, D130G & F142L) CaM mutations result in alteration of their biochemical and biophysical properties. Ca(2+)-binding studies indicate that the CPVT-associated CaM mutations, N54I & N98S, exhibit the same or a 3-fold reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity, respectively, versus wild-type CaM, whereas the LQTS-associated CaM mutants, D96V, D130G & F142L, display more profoundly reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity. In contrast, all five CaM mutations confer a disparate RyR2 interaction and modulation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding to RyR2, regardless of CPVT or LQTS association. Our findings suggest that the clinical presentation of CPVT or LQTS associated with these five CaM mutations may involve both altered intrinsic Ca(2+)-binding as well as defective interaction with RyR2.

10986290|t|An antiestrogen-responsive estrogen receptor-alpha mutant (D351Y) shows weak AF-2 activity in the presence of tamoxifen.
10986290|t|Antiestrogens, including tamoxifen and raloxifene, block estrogen receptor (ER) action by blocking the interactions of an estrogen-dependent activation function (AF-2) with p160 coactivators. Although tamoxifen does show some agonist activity in the presence of ERalpha, this stems from a distinct constitutive activation function (AF-1) that lies within the ERalpha N terminus. Previous studies identified a naturally occurring mutation (D351Y) that allows ERalpha to perceive tamoxifen and raloxifene as estrogens. Here, we examine the contributions of ERalpha activation functions to the D351Y phenotype. We find that the AF-2 function of ERalpha D351Y lacks detectable tamoxifen-dependent activity when tested in isolation but does synergize with AF-1 to allow enhanced tamoxifen response. Weak tamoxifen-dependent interactions between the ERalpha D351Y AF-2 function and GRIP1, a representative p160, can be detected in glutathione S-transferase binding assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity can be detected in the presence of ERalpha D351Y and high levels of overexpressed GRIP1. We therefore propose that the D351Y mutation allows weak tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity but that this activity is only detectable when AF-1 is strong, and AF-1 and AF-2 synergize, or when p160s are overexpressed. We discuss the possible structural basis of this effect.

19048033|t|Rational optimization of a bispecific ligand trap targeting EGF receptor family ligands.
19048033|t|The human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (HER) family members cooperate in malignancy. Of this family, HER2 does not bind growth factors and HER3 does not encode an active tyrosine kinase. This diversity creates difficulty in creating pan-specific therapeutic HER family inhibitors. We have identified single amino acid changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER3 which create high affinity sequestration of the cognate ligands, and may be used as receptor decoys to downregulate aberrant HER family activity. In silico modeling and high throughput mutagenesis were utilized to identify receptor mutants with very high ligand binding activity. A single mutation (T15S; EGFR subdomain I) enhanced affinity for EGF (two-fold), TGF-alpha (twenty-six-fold), and heparin-binding (HB)-EGF (six-fold). This indicates that T15 is an important, previously undescribed, negative regulatory amino acid for EGFR ligand binding. Another mutation (Y246A; HER 3 subdomain II) enhanced neuregulin (NRG)1-beta binding eight-fold, probably by interfering with subdomain II-IV interactions. Further work revealed that the HER3 subunit of an EGFR:HER3 heterodimer suppresses EGFR ligand binding. Optimization required reversing this suppression by mutation of the EGFR tether domain (G564A; subdomain IV). This mutation resulted in enhanced ligand binding (EGF, ten-fold; TGF-alpha, thirty-four-fold; HB-EGF, seventeen-fold; NRG1-beta, thirty-one-fold). This increased ligand binding was reflected in improved inhibition of in vitro tumor cell proliferation and tumor suppression in a human non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model. In conclusion, amino acid substitutions were identified in the EGFR and HER3 ECDs that enhance ligand affinity, potentially enabling a pan-specific therapeutic approach for downregulating the HER family in cancer.

12589802|t|Activation of Rac and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytokine receptors induced by cross-linking of integrin alpha4beta1 and cell adhesion in hematopoietic cells.
12589802|t|Adhesion of hematopoietic cells, mainly through alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrins, to the bone marrow microenvironment may play important roles in regulation of hematopoiesis. However, the mechanisms for signaling, outside-in signaling, have largely remained to be established. We demonstrate here that cross-linking of alpha4beta1 by anti-alpha4 antibody induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, Shc, and Cbl as well as binding of the adaptor protein CrkL with Cbl in a murine hematopoietic cell line, 32D/EpoR-Wt. Furthermore, cross-linking of alpha4beta1 induced activation of the Rho family small GTPase Rac, which was enhanced by induced overexpression of CrkL and was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3(')-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. In addition, adhesion of 32D/EpoR-Wt cells to immobilized H-296, a recombinant fibronectin peptide specific for alpha4beta1, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and the IL-3 receptor beta subunit as well as Pyk2, Shc, and Cbl. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and EpoR was also induced in a human leukemic cell line, UT-7, by adhesion to immobilized H-296. However, adhesion of 32D/EpoR-PM4 cells, expressing the W282R mutant EpoR defective in coupling with Jak2, to immobilized H-296 failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant EpoR. These results implicate CrkL in PI3K-dependent activation of Rac by outside-in signaling from alpha4beta1 and suggest that adhesion through alpha4beta1 further activates cytokine receptor-associated Jak2 to induce phosphorylation of these receptors.

15910284|t|Identification of calcium-regulated heat-stable protein of 24 kDa (CRHSP24) as a physiological substrate for PKB and RSK using KESTREL.
15910284|t|A substrate for PKBalpha (protein kinase Balpha) was detected in liver extracts, and was purified and identified as CRHSP24 (calcium-regulated heat-stable protein of apparent molecular mass 24 kDa). PKBalpha, as well as SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1) and RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase), phosphorylated CRHSP24 stoichiometrically at Ser52 in vitro and its brain-specific isoform PIPPin at the equivalent residue (Ser58). CRHSP24 became phosphorylated at Ser52 when HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were stimulated with IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) and this was prevented by inhibitors of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), but not by rapamycin [an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)] or PD 184352, an inhibitor of the classical MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade and hence the activation of RSK. IGF-1 induced a similar phosphorylation of CRHSP24 in ES (embryonic stem) cells from wild-type mice or mice that express the PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) mutant (PDK1[L155E]) that activates PKBalpha normally, but cannot activate SGK. CRHSP24 also became phosphorylated at Ser52 in response to EGF (epidermal growth factor) and this was prevented by blocking activation of both the classical MAPK cascade and the activation of PKBalpha, but not if just one of these pathways was inhibited. DYRK2 (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated protein kinase 2) phosphorylated CRHSP24 at Ser30, Ser32 and Ser41 in vitro, and Ser41 was identified as a site phosphorylated in cells. These and other results demonstrate that CRHSP24 is phosphorylated at Ser52 by PKBalpha in response to IGF-1, at Ser52 by PKBalpha and RSK in response to EGF, and at Ser41 in the absence of IGF-1/EGF by a DYRK isoform or another proline-directed protein kinase(s).

9188101|t|Identification of the binding site in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 for its receptor, leukocyte function-associated antigen 1.
9188101|t|Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is a member of the Ig superfamily and is a counterreceptor for the beta 2 integrins: lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18), complement receptor 1 (MAC-1, CD11b/CD18), and p150,95 (CD11c/CD18). Binding of ICAM-1 to these receptors mediates leukocyte-adhesive functions in immune and inflammatory responses. In this report, we describe a cell-free assay using purified recombinant extracellular domains of LFA-1 and a dimeric immunoadhesin of ICAM-1. The binding of recombinant secreted LFA-1 to ICAM-1 is divalent cation dependent (Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote binding) and sensitive to inhibition by antibodies that block LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion, indicating that its conformation mimics that of LFA-1 on activated lymphocytes. We describe six novel anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies, two of which are function blocking. Thirty-five point mutants of the ICAM-1 immunoadhesin were generated and residues important for binding of monoclonal antibodies and purified LFA-1 were identified. Nineteen of these mutants bind recombinant LFA-1 equivalently to wild type. Sixteen mutants show a 66-2500-fold decrease in LFA-1 binding yet, with few exceptions, retain binding to the monoclonal antibodies. These mutants, along with modeling studies, define the LFA-1 binding site on ICAM-1 as residues E34, K39, M64, Y66, N68, and Q73, that are predicted to lie on the CDFG beta-sheet of the Ig fold. The mutant G32A also abrogates binding to LFA-1 while retaining binding to all of the antibodies, possibly indicating a direct interaction of this residue with LFA-1. These data have allowed the generation of a highly refined model of the LFA-1 binding site of ICAM-1.

14517323|t|The retrieval function of the KDEL receptor requires PKA phosphorylation of its C-terminus.
14517323|t|The KDEL receptor is a Golgi/intermediate compartment-located integral membrane protein that carries out the retrieval of escaped ER proteins bearing a C-terminal KDEL sequence. This occurs throughout retrograde traffic mediated by COPI-coated transport carriers. The role of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the KDEL receptor in this process has been investigated. Deletion of this domain did not affect receptor subcellular localization although cells expressing this truncated form of the receptor failed to retain KDEL ligands intracellularly. Permeabilized cells incubated with ATP and GTP exhibited tubular processes-mediated redistribution from the Golgi area to the ER of the wild-type receptor, whereas the truncated form lacking the C-terminal domain remained concentrated in the Golgi. As revealed with a peptide-binding assay, this domain did not interact with both coatomer and ARF-GAP unless serine 209 was mutated to aspartic acid. In contrast, alanine replacement of serine 209 inhibited coatomer/ARF-GAP recruitment, receptor redistribution into the ER, and intracellular retention of KDEL ligands. Serine 209 was phosphorylated by both cytosolic and recombinant protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit. Inhibition of endogenous PKA activity with H89 blocked Golgi-ER transport of the native receptor but did not affect redistribution to the ER of a mutated form bearing aspartic acid at position 209. We conclude that PKA phosphorylation of serine 209 is required for the retrograde transport of the KDEL receptor from the Golgi complex to the ER from which the retrieval of proteins bearing the KDEL signal depends.

10772864|t|Crystal structure of cancer chemopreventive Bowman-Birk inhibitor in ternary complex with bovine trypsin at 2.3 A resolution. Structural basis of Janus-faced serine protease inhibitor specificity.
10772864|t|Understanding molecular recognition on a structural basis is an objective with broad academic and applied significance. In the complexes of serine proteases and their proteinaceous inhibitors, recognition is governed mainly by residue P1 in accord with primary serine protease specificity. The bifunctional soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor (sBBI) should, therefore, interact at LysI16 (subdomain 1) with trypsin and at LeuI43 (subdomain 2) with chymotrypsin. In contrast with this prediction, a 2:1 assembly with trypsin was observed in solution and in the crystal structure of sBBI in complex with trypsin, determined at 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement. Strikingly, P1LeuI43 of sBBI was fully embedded into the S(1) pocket of trypsin in contrast to primary specificity. The triple-stranded beta-hairpin unique to the BBI-family and the surface loops surrounding the active site of the enzyme formed a protein-protein-interface far extended beyond the primary contact region. Polar residues, hydrophilic bridges and weak hydrophobic contacts were predominant in subdomain 1, interacting specifically with trypsin. However, close hydrophobic contacts across the interface were characteristic of subdomain 2 reacting with both trypsin and chymotrypsin. A Met27Ile replacement shifted the ratio with trypsin to the predicted 1:1 ratio. Thus, the buried salt-bridge responsible for trypsin specificity was stabilised in a polar, and destabilized in a hydrophobic, environment. This may be used for adjusting the specificity of protease inhibitors for applications such as insecticides and cancer chemopreventive agents.

27906179|t|PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of PINK1 and Parkin is essential for mitochondrial quality control.
27906179|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis of a large number of inherited diseases in humans, including Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. The Parkinson's disease genes pink1 and parkin, which encode a mitochondrially targeted protein kinase, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively, participate in a key mitochondrial quality-control pathway that eliminates damaged mitochondria. In the current study, we established an in vivo PINK1/Parkin-induced photoreceptor neuron degeneration model in Drosophila with the aim of dissecting the PINK1/Parkin pathway in detail. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified Serine 346 as the sole autophosphorylation site of Drosophila PINK1 and found that substitution of Serine 346 to Alanine completely abolished the PINK1 autophosphorylation. Disruption of either PINK1 or Parkin phosphorylation impaired the PINK1/Parkin pathway, and the degeneration phenotype of photoreceptor neurons was obviously alleviated. Phosphorylation of PINK1 is not only required for the PINK1-mediated mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin but also induces its kinase activity toward Parkin. In contrast, phosphorylation of Parkin by PINK1 is dispensable for its translocation but required for its activation. Moreover, substitution with autophosphorylation-deficient PINK1 failed to rescue pink1 null mutant phenotypes. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophosphorylation of PINK1 is essential for the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin and for subsequent phosphorylation and activation of Parkin.

11821392|t|alpha-Synuclein interacts with phospholipase D isozymes and inhibits pervanadate-induced phospholipase D activation in human embryonic kidney-293 cells.
11821392|t|alpha-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Although the function of alpha-synuclein remains largely unknown, recent studies have demonstrated that this protein can interact with phospholipids. To address the role of alpha-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease, we have investigated whether it binds phospholipase D (PLD) and affects PLD activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing wild type alpha-synuclein or the mutant forms of alpha-synuclein (A53T, A30P) associated with Parkinson's disease. Tyrosine phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein appears to play a modulatory role in the inhibition of PLD, because mutation of Tyr(125) to Phe slightly increases inhibitory effect of alpha-synuclein on PLD activity. Treatment with pervanadate or phorbol myristate acetate inhibits PLD more in HEK 293 cells overexpressing alpha-synuclein than in control cells. Binding of alpha-synuclein to PLD requires phox and pleckstrin homology domain of PLD and the amphipathic repeat region and non-Abeta component of alpha-synuclein. Although biologically important, co-transfection studies indicate that the interaction of alpha-synuclein with PLD does not influence the tendency of alpha-synuclein to form pathological inclusions. These results suggest that the association of alpha-synuclein with PLD, and modulation of PLD activity, is biologically important, but PLD does not appear to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of alpha-synuclein.

14512552|t|Interacting domains of the HN and F proteins of newcastle disease virus.
14512552|t|The activation of most paramyxovirus fusion proteins (F proteins) requires not only cleavage of F(0) to F(1) and F(2) but also coexpression of the homologous attachment protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or hemagglutinin (H). The type specificity requirement for HN or H protein coexpression strongly suggests that an interaction between HN and F proteins is required for fusion, and studies of chimeric HN proteins have implicated the membrane-proximal ectodomain in this interaction. Using biotin-labeled peptides with sequences of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F protein heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain, we detected a specific interaction with amino acids 124 to 152 from the NDV HN protein. Biotin-labeled HR2 peptides bound to glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing these HN protein sequences but not to GST or to GST containing HN protein sequences corresponding to amino acids 49 to 118. To verify the functional significance of the interaction, two point mutations in the HN protein gene, I133L and L140A, were made individually by site-specific mutagenesis to produce two mutant proteins. These mutations inhibited the fusion promotion activities of the proteins without significantly affecting their surface expression, attachment activities, or neuraminidase activities. Furthermore, these changes in the sequence of amino acids 124 to 152 in the GST-HN fusion protein that bound HR2 peptides affected the binding of the peptides. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that HN protein binds to the F protein HR2 domain, an interaction important for the fusion promotion activity of the HN protein.
