20638386|t|Crystal structure of tubulin folding cofactor A from Arabidopsis thaliana and its beta-tubulin binding characterization.
20638386|t|Microtubules are composed of polymerized alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimers. Biogenesis of assembly-competent tubulin dimers is a complex multistep process that requires sequential actions of distinct molecular chaperones and cofactors. Tubulin folding cofactor A (TFCA), which captures beta-tubulin during the folding pathway, has been identified in many organisms. Here, we report the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana TFC A (KIESEL, KIS), which forms a monomeric three-helix bundle. The functional binding analysis demonstrated that KIS interacts with beta-tubulin in plant. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies indicated that the alpha-helical regions of KIS participate in beta-tubulin binding. Unlike the budding yeast TFC A, the two loop regions of KIS are not required for this interaction suggesting a distinct binding mechanism of TFC A to beta-tubulin in plants.

21775823|t|p53 inhibits autophagy by interacting with the human ortholog of yeast Atg17, RB1CC1/FIP200.
21775823|t|The tumor suppressor protein p53 tonically suppresses autophagy when it is present in the cytoplasm. This effect is phylogenetically conserved from mammals to nematodes, and human p53 can inhibit autophagy in yeast, as we show here. Bioinformatic investigations of the p53 interactome in relationship to the autophagy-relevant protein network underscored the possible relevance of a direct molecular interaction between p53 and the mammalian ortholog of the essential yeast autophagy protein Atg17, namely RB1-inducible coiled-coil protein 1 (RB1CC1), also called FAK family kinase-interacting protein of 200 KDa (FIP200). Mutational analyses revealed that a single point mutation in p53 (K382R) abolished its capacity to inhibit autophagy upon transfection into p53-deficient human colon cancer or yeast cells. In conditions in which wild-type p53 co-immunoprecipitated with RB1CC1/FIP200, p53 (K382R) failed to do so, underscoring the importance of the physical interaction between these proteins for the control of autophagy. In conclusion, p53 regulates autophagy through a direct molecular interaction with RB1CC1/FIP200, a protein that is essential for the very apical step of autophagy initiation.

18725399|t|A direct interaction between the Utp6 half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat domain and a specific peptide in Utp21 is essential for efficient pre-rRNA processing.
18725399|t|The small subunit (SSU) processome is a ribosome biogenesis intermediate that assembles from its subcomplexes onto the pre-18S rRNA with yet unknown order and structure. Here, we investigate the architecture of the UtpB subcomplex of the SSU processome, focusing on the interaction between the half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat (HAT) domain of Utp6 and a specific peptide in Utp21. We present a comprehensive map of the interactions within the UtpB subcomplex and further show that the N-terminal domain of Utp6 interacts with Utp18 while the HAT domain interacts with Utp21. Using a panel of point and deletion mutants of Utp6, we show that an intact HAT domain is essential for efficient pre-rRNA processing and cell growth. Further investigation of the Utp6-Utp21 interaction using both genetic and biophysical methods shows that the HAT domain binds a specific peptide ligand in Utp21, the first example of a HAT domain peptide ligand, with a dissociation constant of 10 muM.

21569203|t|The A domain of fibronectin-binding protein B of Staphylococcus aureus contains a novel fibronectin binding site.
21569203|t|The fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB are multifunctional adhesins than can also bind to fibrinogen and elastin. In this study, the N2N3 subdomains of region A of FnBPB were shown to bind fibrinogen with a similar affinity to those of FnBPA (2  M). The binding site for FnBPB in fibrinogen was localized to the C-terminus of the y-chain. Like clumping factor A, region A of FnBPB bound to the y-chain of fibrinogen in a Ca(2+)-inhibitable manner. The deletion of 17 residues from the C-terminus of domain N3 and the substitution of two residues in equivalent positions for crucial residues for fibrinogen binding in clumping factor A and FnBPA eliminated fibrinogen binding by FnBPB. This indicates that FnBPB binds fibrinogen by the dock-lock-latch mechanism. In contrast, the A domain of FnBPB bound fibronectin with K(D) = 2.5  M despite lacking any of the known fibronectin-binding tandem repeats. A truncate lacking the C-terminal 17 residues (latching peptide) bound fibronectin with the same affinity, suggesting that the FnBPB A domain binds fibronectin by a novel mechanism. The substitution of the two residues required for fibrinogen binding also resulted in a loss of fibronectin binding. This, combined with the observation that purified subdomain N3 bound fibronectin with a measurable, but reduced, K(D) of 20  M, indicates that the type I modules of fibronectin bind to both the N2 and N3 subdomains. The fibronectin-binding ability of the FnBPB A domain was also functional when the protein was expressed on and anchored to the surface of staphylococcal cells, showing that it is not an artifact of recombinant protein expression.

10604475|t|Binding of paxillin to alpha4 integrins modifies integrin-dependent biological responses.
10604475|t|The alpha4 integrins are indispensable for embryogenesis, haematopoiesis and immune responses, possibly because alpha4 regulates cellular functions differently from other integrins through its cytoplasmic tail. We used novel mimics of the alpha4 tail to identify molecules that could account for alpha4-specific signalling. Here we report that the alpha4 tail, but not several other alpha-subunit tails, binds tightly to the signalling adaptor paxillin. Paxillin physically associated with alpha4 integrins in Jurkat T cells at high stoichiometry, and joining the alpha4 tail to alphaIIb resulted in a complex of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 with paxillin. This association markedly enhanced the rates of alphaIIbbeta3-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and cell migration. It also reduced cell spreading, focal adhesion and stress fibre formation. A point mutation within the alpha4 tail that disrupts paxillin binding reversed all of these effects. Furthermore, alpha4beta1-dependent adhesion to VCAM-1 led to spreading of mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from paxillin-null but not from wild-type mice. Thus, the tight association of paxillin with the alpha4 tail leads to distinct biochemical and biological responses to integrin-mediated cell adhesion.

20618438|t|N-glycosylation is important for the correct intracellular localization of HFE and its ability to decrease cell surface transferrin binding.
20618438|t|HFE is a type 1 transmembrane protein that becomes N-glycosylated during transport to the cell membrane. It influences cellular iron concentrations through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of transferrin binding to transferrin receptors. The importance of glycosylation in HFE localization and function has not yet been studied. Here we employed bioinformatics to identify putative N-glycosylation sites at residues N110, N130 and N234 of the human HFE protein, and used site-directed mutagenesis to create combinations of single, double or triple mutants. Compared with the wild-type protein, which co-localizes with the type 1 transferrin receptor in the endosomal recycling compartment and on distributed punctae, the triple mutant co-localized with BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was similar to the localization pattern described previously for the misfolding HFE-C282Y mutant that causes type 1 hereditary haemachromatosis. We also observed that the triple mutant was functionally deficient in beta2-microglobulin interactions and incapable of regulating transferrin binding, once again, reminiscent of the HFE-C282Y variant. Single and double mutants that undergo limited glycosylation appeared to have a mixed phenotype, with characteristics primarily of the wild-type, but also some from the glycosylation-deficient protein. Therefore, although they displayed an endosomal recycling compartment/punctate localization like the wild-type protein, many cells simultaneously displayed additional reticular localization. Furthermore, although the majority of cells expressing these single and double mutants showed decreased surface binding of transferrin, a number appeared to have lost this ability. We conclude that glycosylation is important for the normal intracellular trafficking and functional activity of HFE.

12819209|t|Threonine 391 phosphorylation of the human prolactin receptor mediates a novel interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.
12819209|t|The prolactin receptor (PrlR) is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily that lacks an intrinsic kinase domain and relies on the cytoplasmic Jak tyrosine kinases to transduce signals. Prolactin-induced Jak2 activation and consequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and downstream signaling molecules have been studied, but phosphorylation of the PrlR on serine or threonine residues has not been reported. Here we describe a novel interaction between the PrlR and the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14-3-3 proteins. This association is mediated by the KCST391WP motif, which occurs in the major functional isoform of the human receptor and is conserved among a wide variety of species. Mutagenesis of threonine 391 to alanine significantly impaired 14-3-3 binding to the PrlR in both glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In breast carcinoma and mouse mammary epithelial cell lines, the endogenous receptor was found to associate with glutathione S-transferase-14-3-3 proteins independent of prolactin stimulation. A phospho-specific peptide antibody was generated and used to demonstrate phosphorylation of Thr391 in vivo. Phosphorylation of this site was found to be sensitive to okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases. Interestingly, the T391A PrlR mutant exhibited increased basal and prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation compared with the wild-type receptor. This was accompanied by a ligand-induced increase in protein kinase B and Erk activation but not that of Stat5a. Phosphorylation of the receptor on Thr391 may therefore provide a new mechanism by which prolactin signaling is attenuated.

21600204|t|Essential residues in the H-NS binding site of Hha, a co-regulator of horizontally acquired genes in Enterobacteria.
21600204|t|Proteins of the Hha/YmoA family co-regulate with H-NS the expression of horizontally acquired genes in Enterobacteria. Systematic mutations of conserved acidic residues in Hha have allowed the identification of D48 as an essential residue for H-NS binding and the involvement of E25. Mutations of these residues resulted in deregulation of sensitive genes in vivo. D48 is only partially solvent accessible, yet it defines the functional binding interface between Hha and H-NS confirming that Hha has to undergo a conformational change to bind H-NS. Exposed acidic residues, such as E25, may electrostatically facilitate and direct the approach of Hha to the positively charged region of H-NS enabling the formation of the final complex when D48 becomes accessible by a conformational change of Hha.

10206957|t|Many type I signal peptidases from eubacterial cells appear to contain a serine/lysine catalytic dyad.

9571151|t|Identification and characterization of a novel SH3-domain binding protein, Sab, which preferentially associates with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BtK).
9571151|t|Protein interaction cloning method was used to identify a novel molecule, Sab, which binds to the SH3 domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), the deficient cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia and murine X-linked immunodeficiency. Immunoprecipitation using the anti-Sab antibody identified the protein product of the gene as a 70 kDa molecule. While Sab does not have a proline-rich sequence, it was shown to bind to Btk through the commonly conserved structure among SH3 domains. Remarkably, Sab exhibited a high preference for binding to Btk rather than to other cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which suggests a unique role of Sab in the Btk signal transduction pathway.

16236155|t|An Arabidopsis GRIP domain protein locates to the trans-Golgi and binds the small GTPase ARL1.
16236155|t|GRIP domain proteins are a class of golgins that have been described in yeast and animals. They locate to the trans-Golgi network and are thought to play a role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking. The Arabidopsis GRIP domain protein, AtGRIP, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), locates to Golgi stacks but does not exactly co-locate with the Golgi marker sialyl transferase (ST)-mRFP, nor with the t-SNAREs Memb11, SYP31 and BS14a. We conclude that the location of AtGRIP is further to the trans side of the stack than STtmd-mRFP. The 185-aa C-terminus of AtGRIP containing the GRIP domain targeted GFP to the Golgi, although a proportion of the fusion protein was still found in the cytosol. Mutation of a conserved tyrosine (Y717) to alanine in the GRIP domain disrupted Golgi localization. ARL1 is a small GTPase required for Golgi targeting of GRIP domain proteins in other systems. An Arabidopsis ARL1 homologue was isolated and shown to target to Golgi stacks. The GDP-restricted mutant of ARL1, AtARL1-T31N, was observed to locate partially to the cytosol, whereas the GTP-restricted mutant AtARL1-Q71L labelled the Golgi and a population of small structures. Increasing the levels of AtARL1 in epidermal cells increased the proportion of GRIP-GFP fusion protein on Golgi stacks. We show, moreover, that AtARL1 interacted with the GRIP domain in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro in affinity chromatography and in the yeast two-hybrid system. This indicates that AtGRIP and AtARL1 interact directly. We conclude that the pathway involving ARL1 and GRIP domain golgins is conserved in plants.

25117763|t|Structure and mechanism of the unique C2 domain of Aida.
25117763|t|Axin interactor, dorsalization-associated (Aida) was identified as a regulatory factor that utilizes its C-terminal region to interact with axis formation inhibitor (Axin). Aida abrogates the Axin-mediated Jun N-terminal kinase activation required for proper dorsalization during zebrafish embryonic development, and thus functions as a proventralization factor. Here, we report the structure of Aida C-terminal fragments, which adopt a conventional C2 domain topology. We also demonstrate that Aida can specifically bind to phosphoinositides in a Ca(2+) -independent manner, and is able to associate with the cell membrane via a novel positively charged surface, namely a basic loop. Mutation of the positively charged patch on the basic loop leads to destabilization of the Aida-membrane association or disruption of the Aida-Axin interaction, resulting in impaired Jun N-terminal kinase inhibition. Together, our findings provide a molecular basis for C2 domain-mediated Aida-membrane and Aida-Axin associations.

20849418|t|Autolytic activity of human calpain 7 is enhanced by ESCRT-III-related protein IST1 through MIT-MIM interaction.
20849418|t|Calpain 7, a mammalian ortholog of yeast Cpl1/Rim13 and fungal PalB, is an atypical calpain that lacks a penta-EF-hand domain. Previously, we reported that a region containing a tandem repeat of microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domains in calpain 7 interacts with a subset of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III-related proteins, suggesting involvement of calpain 7 in the ESCRT system. Although yeast and fungal calpains are thought to be involved in alkaline adaptation via limited proteolysis of specific transcription factors, proteolytic activity of calpain 7 has not been demonstrated yet. In this study, we investigated the interaction between calpain 7 and a newly reported ESCRT-III family member, increased sodium tolerance-1 (IST1), which possesses two different types of MIT-interacting motifs (MIM1 and MIM2). We found that glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fused tandem MIT domains of calpain 7 (calpain 7MIT) pulled down FLAG-tagged IST1 expressed in HEK293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation assays with various deletion or point mutants of epitope-tagged calpain 7 and IST1 revealed that both repetitive MIT domains and MIMs are required for efficient interaction. Direct MIT-MIM binding was confirmed by a pulldown experiment with GST-fused IST1 MIM and purified recombinant calpain 7MIT. Furthermore, we found that the GST-MIM protein enhances the autolysis of purified Strep-tagged monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP)-fused calpain 7 (mGFP-calpain 7-Strep). The autolysis was almost completely abolished by 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide but only partially inhibited by 1 mm leupeptin or E-64. The putative catalytic Cys290-substituted mutant (mGFP-calpain 7(C290S)-Strep) showed no autolytic activity. These results demonstrate for the first time that human calpain 7 is proteolytically active, and imply that calpain 7 is activated in the ESCRT system.

11359905|t|The corepressor mSin3a interacts with the proline-rich domain of p53 and protects p53 from proteasome-mediated degradation.
11359905|t|While the transactivation function of the tumor suppressor p53 is well understood, less is known about the transrepression functions of this protein. We have previously shown that p53 interacts with the corepressor protein mSin3a (hereafter designated Sin3) in vivo and that this interaction is critical for the ability of p53 to repress gene expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that expression of Sin3 results in posttranslational stabilization of both exogenous and endogenous p53, due to an inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of this protein. Stabilization of p53 by Sin3 requires the Sin3-binding domain, determined here to map to the proline-rich region of p53, from amino acids 61 to 75. The correlation between Sin3 binding and stabilization supports the hypothesis that this domain of p53 may normally be subject to a destabilizing influence. The finding that a synthetic mutant of p53 lacking the Sin3-binding domain has an increased half-life in cells, compared to wild-type p53, supports this premise. Interestingly, unlike retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, MDMX, and p14(ARF), Sin3 stabilizes p53 in an MDM2-independent manner. The ability of Sin3 to stabilize p53 is consistent with the model whereby these two proteins must exist on a promoter for extended periods, in order for repression to be an effective mechanism of gene regulation. This model is consistent with our data indicating that, unlike the p300-p53 complex, the p53-Sin3 complex is immunologically detectable for prolonged periods following exposure of cells to agents of DNA damage.

19372599|t|Human disease-causing mutations disrupt an N-C-terminal interaction and channel function of bestrophin 1.
19372599|t|Mutations in the human bestrophin 1 (hBest1) chloride channel cause Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. Although mutations in its transmembrane domains were found to alter biophysical properties of the channel, the mechanism for disease-causing mutations in its N and C termini remains elusive. We hypothesized that these mutations lead to channel dysfunction through disruption of an N-C-terminal interaction. Here, we present data demonstrating that hBest1 N and C termini indeed interact both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, using a spectrum-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer method, we showed that functional hBest1 channels in the plasma membrane were multimers. Disease-causing mutations in the N terminus (R19C, R25C, and K30C) and the C terminus (G299E, D301N, and D312N) caused channel dysfunction and disruption of the N-C interaction. Consistent with the functional and biochemical results, mutants D301N and D312N clearly reduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal, indicating that the N-C interaction was indeed perturbed. These results suggest that hBest1 functions as a multimer in the plasma membrane, and disruption of the N-C interaction by mutations leads to hBest1 channel dysfunction.

21057547|t|AXIN is an essential co-activator for the promyelocytic leukemia protein in p53 activation.
21057547|t|The PML protein is best known for its role as a tumor suppressor for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Both PML and the key Wnt signaling regulator AXIN regulate p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage. However, how the two major tumor suppressors coordinate with each other is unknown, and the molecular components orchestrating the PML-induced apoptosis remain enigmatic. Here we show that AXIN interacts with PML in vivo, and further that AXIN, PML and p53 form a ternary complex. Exposure to genotoxic signals including UV and doxorubicin induces AXIN to enter into the nucleus where it colocalizes with PML in the nuclear bodies. Domain-mapping experiments revealed that the C-terminal region (aa 597-832) of AXIN is responsible for its interaction with PML. AXIN fails to activate p53 in PML(-/-) cells, and conversely, PML is unable to activate p53 in AXIN-null SNU475 cells. Consistently, knockdown with respective siRNAs revealed that AXIN and PML depend on each other to elevate p53-Ser-46 phosphorylation and to induce apoptosis after treatment with genotoxins. Moreover, we found that dominant-negative mutants of PML blocked AXIN-induced p53 activation, and that AXIN promotes PML sumoylation, a modification necessary for PML functions. Our finding has thus provided a new avenue for understanding the mechanism by which PML activates p53 and exerts its role as a tumor suppressor.

22529269|t|Artemis C-terminal region facilitates V(D)J recombination through its interactions with DNA Ligase IV and DNA-PKcs.
22529269|t|Artemis is an endonuclease that opens coding hairpin ends during V(D)J recombination and has critical roles in postirradiation cell survival. A direct role for the C-terminal region of Artemis in V(D)J recombination has not been defined, despite the presence of immunodeficiency and lymphoma development in patients with deletions in this region. Here, we report that the Artemis C-terminal region directly interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Ligase IV, a DNA Ligase which plays essential roles in DNA repair and V(D)J recombination. The Artemis-Ligase IV interaction is specific and occurs independently of the presence of DNA and DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), another protein known to interact with the Artemis C-terminal region. Point mutations in Artemis that disrupt its interaction with Ligase IV or DNA-PKcs reduce V(D)J recombination, and Artemis mutations that affect interactions with Ligase IV and DNA-PKcs show additive detrimental effects on coding joint formation. Signal joint formation remains unaffected. Our data reveal that the C-terminal region of Artemis influences V(D)J recombination through its interaction with both Ligase IV and DNA-PKcs.

18583960|t|TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is of central importance for the induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in response to pathogens. We identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX3X as an interaction partner of TBK1. TBK1 and DDX3X acted synergistically in their ability to stimulate the IFN promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated reduction of DDX3X expression led to an impairment of IFN production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that DDX3X is recruited to the IFN promoter upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism of action. DDX3X was found to be a TBK1 substrate in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants of DDX3X failed to synergize with TBK1 in their ability to stimulate the IFN promoter. Overall, our data imply that DDX3X is a critical effector of TBK1 that is necessary for type I IFN induction.

19207211|t|The targeting of the oxysterol-binding protein ORP3a to the endoplasmic reticulum relies on the plant VAP33 homolog PVA12.
19207211|t|In plants, sterols play fundamental roles as membrane constituents in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, and act as precursors for cell wall deposition. Sterols are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but mainly accumulate in the plasma membrane. How sterols are trafficked in plant cells is largely unknown. In non-plant systems, oxysterol-binding proteins have been involved in sterol trafficking and homeostasis. There are at least twelve homologs of oxysterol-binding proteins in the Arabidopsis genome, but the biology of these proteins remains for the most part obscure. Here, we report our analysis of the targeting requirements and the sterol-binding properties of a small Arabidopsis oxysterol-binding protein, ORP3a. We have determined that ORP3a is a bona fide sterol-binding protein with sitosterol-binding properties. Live-cell imaging analyses revealed that ORP3a is localized at the ER, and that binding to this organelle depends on a direct interaction with PVA12, a member of the largely uncharacterized VAP33 family of plant proteins. Molecular modeling analyses and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of a novel protein domain that is responsible for the PVA12-ORP3a interaction. Disruption of the integrity of this domain caused redistribution of ORP3a to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that ORP3a may cycle between the ER and the Golgi. These results represent new insights into the biology of sterol-binding proteins in plant cells, and elucidate a hitherto unknown relationship between members of oxysterol-binding protein and VAP33 families of plant proteins in the early plant secretory pathway.

18570893|t|Interaction with the IQ3 motif of myosin-10 is required for calmodulin-like protein-dependent filopodial extension.
18570893|t|Calmodulin-like protein (CLP) is a specific light chain of unconventional myosin-10 (Myo10) and enhances Myo10-dependent filopodial extension. Here we show that phenylalanine-795 in the third IQ domain (IQ3) of Myo10 is critical for CLP binding. Remarkably, mutation of F795 to alanine had little effect on calmodulin binding to IQ3. Fluorescence microscopy and time-lapse video microscopy showed that HeLa cells expressing CLP and transiently transfected with GFP-Myo10-F795A exhibited significantly shorter filopodia and decreased intrafilopodial motility compared to wildtype GFP-Myo10-transfected cells. Thus, F795 represents a unique anchor for CLP and is essential for CLP-mediated Myo10 function in filopodial extension and motility.

Alpha(13) binds to a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain in p115-RhoGEF, but the mechanism of alpha(13) activation of p115-RhoGEF is poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate in cell-based assays that the acidic-rich N-terminus, adjacent to the RGS domain, is required for binding to activated alpha(13), and refine the importance of this region by showing that mutation of glutamic acids 27 and 29 in full-length p115-RhoGEF is sufficient to prevent interaction with activated alpha(13). However, alpha(13)-interacting deficient N-terminal mutants of p115-RhoGEF retain alpha(13)-dependent plasma membrane recruitment. Overall, these findings demonstrate a critical role for the N-terminal extension of p115-RhoGEF in mediating binding to alpha(13) and dissociate two activities of p115-RhoGEF: binding to activated alpha(13) and translocation to the PM in response to activated alpha(13).

14594800|t|Calmodulin binding to the Fas death domain. Regulation by Fas activation.
14594800|t|Fas (APO-1/CD95) is a cell surface receptor that initiates apoptotic pathways, and its cytoplasmic domain interacts with various molecules suggesting that Fas signaling is complex and regulated by multiple proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is an intracellular Ca(2+)-binding protein, and it mediates many of the effects of Ca2+. Here, we demonstrate that CaM binds to Fas directly and identify the CaM-binding site on the cytoplasmic death domain (DD) of Fas. Fas binds to CaM-Sepharose and is co-immunoprecipitated with CaM. Other death receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor, DR4, and DR5 do not bind to CaM. The interaction between Fas and CaM is Ca(2+)-dependent. Deletion mapping analysis with various GST-fused Fas cytoplasmic domain fragments revealed that the fragment containing helices 1, 2, and 3 of the Fas DD has the CaM-binding ability. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted a potential CaM-binding site in helix 2 and connected loops. A valine 254 to asparagine mutation in this region, which is analogous to the identified mutant allele of Fas in lpr mice that have a deficiency in Fas-mediated apoptosis, showed reduced CaM binding. Computer modeling of the interaction between CaM and helix 2 of the Fas DD predicted that amino acids, which are important for Fas-CaM binding, and point mutations of these amino acids caused reduced Fas-CaM binding. The interaction between Fas and CaM is increased approximately 2-fold early upon Fas activation (at 30 min) and is decreased to approximately 50% of control at 2 h. These findings suggest a novel function of CaM in Fas-mediated apoptosis.

17289029|t|The Kr  ppel-like zinc finger protein Glis2 functions as a negative modulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
17289029|t|To gain insight into the mechanism by which Gli-similar 2 (Glis2) regulates transcription, we performed yeast-two hybrid cDNA library screening using Glis2 as bait. This screening identified beta-catenin as a potential Glis2-interacting protein. Mammalian two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and GST-pulldown analyses supported the interaction between Glis2 and beta-catenin. Pulldown analyses with several Glis2 deletion mutants indicated that the 1st zinc finger motif of Glis2 is critical for its interaction with beta-catenin, while the armadillo repeats of beta-catenin are important in its interaction with Glis2. Reporter analyses showed that Glis2 represses T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcriptional activation. In addition, Glis2 represses the expression of the TCF target gene cyclin D1. Our results indicate that Glis2 interacts with beta-catenin and suggest that Glis2 functions as a negative modulator of beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription.

21239581|t|The sporulation protein SirA inhibits the binding of DnaA to the origin of replication by contacting a patch of clustered amino acids.
21239581|t|Bacteria regulate the frequency and timing of DNA replication initiation by controlling the activity of the replication initiator protein DnaA. SirA is a recently discovered regulator of DnaA in Bacillus subtilis whose synthesis is turned on at the start of sporulation. Here, we demonstrate that SirA contacts DnaA at a patch of 3 residues located on the surface of domain I of the replication initiator protein, corresponding to the binding site used by two unrelated regulators of DnaA found in other bacteria. We show that the interaction of SirA with domain I inhibits the ability of DnaA to bind to the origin of replication. DnaA mutants containing amino acid substitutions of the 3 residues are functional in replication initiation but are immune to inhibition by SirA.

19559006|t|A major mutation of KIF21A associated with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1) enhances translocation of Kank1 to the membrane.
19559006|t|Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1) is associated with heterozygous mutations in the KIF21A gene, including a major (R954W) and a minor (M947T) mutation. Kank1, which regulates actin polymerization, cell migration and neurite outgrowth, interacted with the third and fourth coiled-coil domains of KIF21A protein at its ankyrin-repeat domain. While both KIF21A(R954W) and KIF21A(M947T) enhanced the formation of a heterodimer with the wild type, KIF21A(WT), these mutants also enhanced the interaction with Kank1. Knockdown of KIF21A resulted in Kank1 predominantly occurring in the cytosolic fraction, while KIF21A(WT) slightly enhanced the translocation of Kank1 to the membrane fraction. Moreover, KIF21A(R954W) significantly enhanced the translocation of Kank1 to the membrane fraction. These results suggest that KIF21A regulates the distribution of Kank1 and that KIF21A mutations associated with CFEOM1 enhanced the accumulation of Kank1 in the membrane fraction. This might cause an abrogation of neuronal development in cases of CFEOM1 through over-regulation of actin polymerization by Kank1.

22817896|t|The RIP1/RIP3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid signaling complex required for programmed necrosis.
22817896|t|RIP1 and RIP3 kinases are central players in TNF-induced programmed necrosis. Here, we report that  the RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) of RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the assembly of heterodimeric filamentous structures. The fibrils exhibit classical characteristics of b-amyloids, as shown by Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) binding, circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR. Structured amyloid cores are mapped in RIP1 and RIP3 that are flanked  by regions of mobility. The endogenous RIP1/RIP3 complex isolated from necrotic cells binds ThT, is ultrastable, and has a fibrillar core structure, whereas necrosis is partially inhibited by ThT, CR, and another amyloid dye, HBX. Mutations in the RHIMs of RIP1 and RIP3 that are defective in the interaction compromise cluster formation, kinase activation, and programmed necrosis in  vivo. The current study provides insight into the structural changes that occur when RIP kinases are triggered to execute different signaling outcomes and expands the realm of amyloids to complex formation and signaling.

15805487|t|N-terminal domain-mediated homodimerization is required for photoreceptor activity of Arabidopsis CRYPTOCHROME 1.
15805487|t|Cryptochromes (CRY) are blue light receptors that share sequence similarity with photolyases, flavoproteins that catalyze the repair of UV light-damaged DNA. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings expressing the C-terminal domains of the Arabidopsis CRY fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) display a constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype, indicating that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis CRY is mediated through the C-terminal domain. The role of the Arabidopsis CRY N-terminal photolyase-like domain in CRY action remains poorly understood. Here, we report the essential role of the Arabidopsis CRY1 N-terminal domain (CNT1) in the light activation of CRY1 photoreceptor activity. Yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro binding, in vivo chemical cross-linking, gel filtration, and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that CRY1 homodimerizes in a light-independent manner. Mutagenesis and transgenic studies demonstrate that CNT1-mediated dimerization is required for light activation of the C-terminal domain of CRY1 (CCT1). Transgenic data and native gel electrophoresis studies suggest that multimerization of GUS is both responsible and required for mediating a COP phenotype on fusion to CCT1. These results indicate that the properties of the GUS multimer are analogous to those of the light-modified CNT1 dimer. Irradiation with blue light modifies the properties of the CNT1 dimer, resulting in a change in CCT1, activating CCT1, and eventually triggering the CRY1 signaling pathway.

20494986|t|Cochaperone interactions in export of the type III needle component PscF of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
20494986|t|Type III secretion (T3S) systems allow the export and translocation of bacterial effectors into the host cell cytoplasm. Secretion is accomplished by an 80-nm-long needle-like structure composed, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, of the polymerized form of a 7-kDa protein, PscF. Two proteins, PscG and PscE, stabilize PscF within the bacterial cell before its export and polymerization. In this work we screened the 1,320-A(2) interface between the two chaperones, PscE and PscG, by site-directed mutagenesis and determined hot spot regions that are important for T3S function in vivo and complex formation in vitro. Three amino acids in PscE and five amino acids in PscG, found to be relevant for complex formation, map to the central part of the interacting surface. Stability assays on selected mutants performed both in vitro on purified PscE-PscG complexes and in vivo on P. aeruginosa revealed that PscE is a cochaperone that is essential for the stability of the main chaperone, PscG. Notably, when overexpressed from a bicistronic construct, PscG and PscF compensate for the absence of PscE in cytotoxic P. aeruginosa. These results show that all of the information needed for needle protein stabilization and folding, its presentation to the T3 secreton, and its export is present within the sequence of the PscG chaperone.

8417317|t|Interactions among the subunits of the G protein involved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating.
8417317|t|The SCG1 (GPA1), STE4, and STE18 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode mating-pathway components whose amino acid sequences are similar to those of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, respectively, of mammalian G proteins. Genetic evidence suggests that the STE4 and STE18 gene products interact. The mating defects of a set of ste4 mutants were partially suppressed by the overexpression of STE18, and, moreover, a combination of partially defective ste4 and ste18 alleles created a totally sterile phenotype, whereas such synthetic sterility was not observed when the ste18 allele was combined with a weakly sterile ste11 allele. Others have provided genetic evidence consistent with an interaction between the SCG1 (GPA1) and STE4 gene products. We have examined the physical interactions of these subunits by using an in vivo protein association assay. The STE4 and STE18 gene products associated with each other, and this association was disrupted by a mutation in the STE4 gene product whose phenotype was partially suppressed by overexpression of STE18. The STE4 and SCG1 (GPA1) gene products also interacted in the assay, whereas we detected no association of the SCG1 (GPA1) and STE18 gene products.

8940099|t|Site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha negatively regulates its inducible phosphorylation and degradation.
8940099|t|The transcription factor NF-kappaB is retained in the cytoplasm by its interaction with the inhibitory subunit known as IkappaB. Signal-induced serine phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha target it for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Recently, pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, was shown to block the degradation of IkappaBalpha, thus inhibiting NF-kappaB activation. We investigated the mechanism by which pervanadate inhibits the degradation of IkappaBalpha. Western blot analysis of IkappaBalpha from tumor necrosis factor-treated cells revealed a slower migrating IkappaBalpha species that was subsequently degraded. However, pervanadate-treated cells also revealed a slower migrating species of IkappaBalpha that appeared in a time- and dose-dependent manner and was not degraded by tumor necrosis factor. The slower migrating species of IkappaBalpha from pervanadate-treated cells was tyrosine-phosphorylated as revealed by cross-reactivity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, by the ability of the specific tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B to dephosphorylate it, and by phosphoamino acid analysis of IkappaBalpha immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled cells. By site-specific mutagenesis and deletion analysis, we identified Tyr-42 on IkappaBalpha as the phosphoacceptor site. Furthermore, in an in vitro reconstitution system, tyrosine-phosphorylated IkappaBalpha was protected from degradation. Our results demonstrate that inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr-42, thus preventing NF-kappaB activation.

10921886|t|The RET proto-oncogene induces apoptosis: a novel mechanism for Hirschsprung disease.
10921886|t|The RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), an inherited cancer syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental defect of enteric neurons. We report here that the expression of RET receptor induces apoptosis. This pro-apoptotic effect of RET is inhibited in the presence of its ligand glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Furthermore, we present evidence that RET induces apoptosis via its own cleavage by caspases, a phenomenon allowing the liberation/exposure of a pro-apoptotic domain of RET. In addition, we report that Hirschsprung-associated RET mutations impair GDNF control of RET pro-apoptotic activity. These results indicate that HSCR may result from apoptosis of RET-expressing enteric neuroblasts.

19242489|t|Structural basis of the interaction between integrin alpha6beta4 and plectin at the hemidesmosomes.
19242489|t|The interaction between the integrin alpha6beta4 and plectin is essential for the assembly and stability of hemidesmosomes, which are junctional adhesion complexes that anchor epithelial cells to the basement membrane. We describe the crystal structure at 2.75 A resolution of the primary alpha6beta4-plectin complex, formed by the first pair of fibronectin type III domains and the N-terminal region of the connecting segment of beta4 and the actin-binding domain of plectin. Two missense mutations in beta4 (R1225H and R1281W) linked to nonlethal forms of epidermolysis bullosa prevent essential intermolecular contacts. We also present two structures at 1.75 and 2.05 A resolution of the beta4 moiety in the absence of plectin, which reveal a major rearrangement of the connecting segment of beta4 on binding to plectin. This conformational switch is correlated with the way alpha6beta4 promotes stable adhesion or cell migration and suggests an allosteric control of the integrin.

21642453|t|Identification of an anchor residue for CheA-CheY interactions in the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli.
21642453|t|Transfer of a phosphoryl group from autophosphorylated CheA (P-CheA) to CheY is an important step in the bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction pathway. This reaction involves CheY (i) binding to the P2 domain of P-CheA and then (ii) acquiring the phosphoryl group from the P1 domain. Crystal structures indicated numerous side chain interactions at the CheY-P2 binding interface. To investigate the individual contributions of the P2 side chains involved in these contacts, we analyzed the effects of eight alanine substitution mutations on CheA-CheY binding interactions. An F214A substitution in P2 caused    1,000-fold reduction in CheA-CheY binding affinity, while Ala substitutions at other P2 positions had small effects (E171A, E178A, and I216A) or no detectable effects (H181A, D202A, D207A, and C213A) on binding affinity. These results are discussed in relation to previous in silico predictions of hot-spot and anchor positions at the CheA-CheY interface. We also investigated the consequences of these mutations for chemotaxis signal transduction in living cells. CheA(F214A) was defective in mediating localization of CheY-YFP to the large clusters of signaling proteins that form at the poles of Escherichia coli cells, while the other CheA variants did not differ from wild-type (wt) CheA (CheA(wt)) in this regard. In our set of mutants, only CheA(F214A) exhibited a markedly diminished ability to support chemotaxis in motility agar assays. Surprisingly, however, in FRET assays that monitored receptor-regulated production of phospho-CheY, CheA(F214A) (and each of the other Ala substitution mutants) performed just as well as CheA(wt). Overall, our findings indicate that F214 serves as an anchor residue at the CheA-CheY interface and makes an important contribution to the binding energy in vitro and in vivo; however, loss of this contribution does not have a large negative effect on the overall ability of the signaling pathway to modulate P-CheY levels in response to chemoattractants.

15350535|t|Wrch1 is a GTPase-deficient Cdc42-like protein with unusual binding characteristics and cellular effects.
15350535|t|The Rho family of small GTPases controls many biological processes, including cytoskeletal regulation, membrane trafficking, cell adhesion, cell polarization, transcriptional activity, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. Wrch1, which belongs to the Cdc42 subfamily, is one of the least characterized family member. Despite its homology to other Cdc42-like proteins, we found that Wrch1 has unique characteristics. Biochemical experiments showed that Wrch1 has no detectable GTPase activity in vitro and that its intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate is very high in comparison to Cdc42. Furthermore, NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with Wrch1 showed an up-rounded, retracted phenotype. In addition, Wrch1 was shown to be more efficient than Cdc42 in triggering the formation of filopodia. Serum stimulation of cells expressing Wrch1 induces vigorous membrane blebbing, a phenomenon dependent on the activity of ROCK. In a search for proteins interacting with Wrch1, PAK1 and NCKbeta were identified as binding partners. Interestingly, the interaction to NCKbeta was shown to be mediated via PxxP motifs present in an N-terminal extension of Wrch1 to the second and third SH3 domains of NCKbeta.

26342861|t|Wnts grasp the WIF domain of Wnt Inhibitory Factor 1 at two distinct binding sites.
26342861|t|UNASSIGNED: Wnts have a structure resembling a hand with "thumb" and "index" fingers that grasp the cysteine rich domains of Frizzled receptors at two distinct binding sites. In the present work we show that the WIF domain of Wnt Inhibitory Factor 1 is also bound by Wnts at two sites. Using C-terminal domains of Wnt5a and Wnt7a and arginine-scanning mutagenesis of the WIF domain we demonstrate that, whereas the N-terminal, lipid-modified "thumb" of Wnts interacts with the alkyl-binding site of the WIF domain, the C-terminal domain of Wnts (Wnt-CTD) binds to a surface on the opposite side of the WIF domain.

16254079|t|The ErbB3 binding protein Ebp1 interacts with Sin3A to repress E2F1 and AR-mediated transcription.
16254079|t|Ectopic expression of ebp1, a member of the PA2G4 family, inhibits the proliferation and induces the differentiation of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Ebp1 inhibits transcription of E2F1 and androgen receptor regulated genes such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) through its interactions with histone deacetylases (HDACs). To further understand Ebp1's interactions with other components of the transcriptional repression machinery, we examined the association of Ebp1 with the corepressor Sin3A. Ebp1 interacted with Sin3A both in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis. The C-terminal domain of Ebp1, responsible for its ability to repress transcription and arrest cell growth, was necessary and sufficient for binding Sin3A. The C-terminal domain of Sin3A, containing the paired amphipathic domain 4 and the HDAC interacting domain, bound Ebp1. Recombinant Sin3A bound Ebp1 directly, but recombinant HDAC2 failed to bind Ebp1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA affinity precipitation analysis demonstrated that Ebp1 and Sin3A associate at the PSA and E2F1 promoters. Functionally, Sin3A enhanced the ability of Ebp1 to repress transcription of androgen receptor (AR) and E2F1 regulated genes. These results demonstrate that Ebp1 participates in transcriptional regulation via its interaction with the Sin3-HDAC.

17699755|t|Independent and interdependent functions of LAF1 and HFR1 in phytochrome A signaling.
17699755|t|Several positive regulators of phytochrome A signaling--e.g., LAF1, HFR1, and HY5--operate downstream from the photoreceptor, but their relative sites of action in the transduction pathway are unknown. Here, we show that HFR1RNAi/laf1 or hfr1-201/LAF1RNAi generated by RNA interference (RNAi) has an additive phenotype under FR light compared with the single mutants, hfr1-201 or laf1. This result indicates that LAF1 and HFR1 function in largely independent pathways. LAF1, an R2R3-MYB factor, interacts with HFR1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, and this interaction is abolished by the R97A mutation in the LAF1 R2R3 domain. Polyubiquitinations of LAF1 and HFR1 by the COP1 E3 ligase in vitro are inhibited by LAF1/HFR1 association. Consistent with this result, endogenous HFR1 is less stable in laf1 compared with wild type, and similarly, LAF1-3HA expressed from a transgene is also less stable in hfr1-201 than wild type. In transgenic plants, HFR1 levels are significantly elevated upon induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A). Moreover, induced expression of LAF1 but not LAF1(R97A) delays post-translational HFR1 degradation in FR light. Constitutive coexpression of HFR1 and LAF1 but not HFR1 and LAF1 (R97A) confers FR hypersensitivity in double transgenic plants. Our results show that in addition to their independent functions in phyA signaling, LAF1 and HFR1 also cooperate post-translationally to stabilize each other through inhibition of ubiquitination by COP1, thereby enhancing phyA photoresponses.

15709751|t|Novel rab GAP-like protein, CIP85, interacts with connexin43 and induces its degradation.
15709751|t|Gap junctions play critical roles in tissue function and homeostasis. Connexin43 (Cx43) is a major gap junction protein expressed in the mammalian heart and other tissues and may be regulated by its interaction with other cellular proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel Cx43-interacting protein of 85-kDa, CIP85, which contains a single TBC, SH3, and RUN domain, in addition to a short coiled coil region. Homologues containing this unique combination of domains were found in human, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans. CIP85 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in mouse and human tissues. In vitro interaction assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of endogenous CIP85 with Cx43. In vitro interaction experiments using CIP85 mutants with in-frame deletions of the TBC, SH3, and RUN domains indicated that the SH3 domain of CIP85 is involved in its interaction with Cx43. Conversely, analysis of Cx43 mutants with proline to alanine substitutions in the two proline-rich regions of Cx43 revealed that the P(253)LSP(256) motif is an important determinant of the ability of Cx43 to interact with CIP85. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy showed that CIP85 colocalized with Cx43 at the cell periphery, particularly in areas reminiscent of gap junction plaques. The functional importance of the interaction between CIP85 and Cx43 was suggested by the observation that CIP85 appears to induce the turnover of Cx43 through the lysosomal pathway.

16137687|t|SNX9 as an adaptor for linking synaptojanin-1 to the Cdc42 effector ACK1.
16137687|t|Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9, also referred to as SH3PX1) is a binding partner for the non-receptor and Cdc42-associated kinase (ACK) in Drosophila and mammals. ACK1 is known to bind clathrin and influence EGF receptor endocytosis. SNX9 comprises an N-terminal Src homology domain 3 (SH3), a central PHOX homology (PX) domain, and a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil region. In order to investigate SNX9 further we have made use of a novel in vivo biotinylation system to label various GST-SH3 domains and perform blot overlays, thereby identifying synaptojanin-1 as a partner for SNX9. Biotinylated SH3 domains were also used for specific identification of target proline-rich sequences in synaptojanin and ACK1 on synthetic peptides arrays. Direct assessment of SH3 binding efficiencies at different positions within the extensive proline-rich regions of these proteins were thus determined. While SNX9 targets a number of sequences within the proline-rich regions of synaptojanin, a single site was identified in human ACK1. By testing the association of various truncations of ACK1 with SNX9 we confirmed the dominant SNX9 binding domain in human ACK1 (residues 920-955). In the presence of SNX9 we find that synaptojanin is able to colocalize with distinct ACK1 containing vesicles, indicating that this tyrosine kinase is linked to many components involved in vesicle dynamics including clathrin, AP2 and synaptojanin-1.

17986188|t|Dimerization or oligomerization of the actin-like FtsA protein enhances the integrity of the cytokinetic Z ring.
17986188|t|In bacteria, the actin-like FtsA protein interacts with the tubulin-like FtsZ protein, helping to assemble the cytokinetic Z ring, anchor it to the cytoplasmic membrane and recruit other essential divisome proteins. FtsA also interacts with itself, but it is not clear whether this self-interaction is required for its full functionality. Here we describe new dominant negative missense mutations in Escherichia coli ftsA that specifically inhibit FtsA homodimerization and simultaneously cause disruption of Z rings. The negative effects of one mutation, M71A, were suppressed by altering levels of certain division proteins or by additional mutations in ftsA that promote increased integrity of the Z ring. Remarkably, when FtsA, FtsA-M71A, and other mutants of FtsA that compromise self-interaction were connected in a tandem repeat, they were at least partially functional and suppressed defects of an ftsZ84(ts) mutation. This gain of function by FtsA tandems further suggested that FtsA monomers cause deleterious interactions with FtsZ and that increased dimerization or oligomerization of FtsA enhances its ability to promote Z-ring integrity. Therefore, we propose that FtsZ assembly is regulated by the extent of FtsA oligomerization.

15864306|t|A functional SNP in CILP, encoding cartilage intermediate layer protein, is associated with susceptibility to lumbar disc disease.
15864306|t|Lumbar disc disease (LDD) is caused by degeneration of intervertebral discs of the lumbar spine. One of the most common musculoskeletal disorders, LDD has strong genetic determinants. Using a case-control association study, we identified a functional SNP (1184T --> C, resulting in the amino acid substitution I395T) in CILP, which encodes the cartilage intermediate layer protein, that acts as a modulator of LDD susceptibility. CILP was expressed abundantly in intervertebral discs, and its expression increased as disc degeneration progressed. CILP colocalized with TGF-beta1 in clustering chondrocytes and their territorial matrices in intervertebral discs. CILP inhibited TGF-beta1-mediated induction of cartilage matrix genes through direct interaction with TGF-beta1 and inhibition of TGF-beta1 signaling. The susceptibility-associated 1184C allele showed increased binding and inhibition of TGF-beta1. Therefore, we conclude that the extracellular matrix protein CILP regulates TGF-beta signaling and that this regulation has a crucial role in the etiology and pathogenesis of LDD. Our study also adds to the list of connective tissue diseases that are associated with TGF-beta.

10206962|t|Dibromopropanone cross-linking of the phosphopantetheine and active-site cysteine thiols of the animal fatty acid synthase can occur both inter- and intrasubunit. Reevaluation of the side-by-side, antiparallel subunit model.
10206962|t|The objective of this study was to test a new model for the homodimeric animal FAS which implies that the condensation reaction can be catalyzed by the amino-terminal beta-ketoacyl synthase domain in cooperation with the penultimate carboxyl-terminal acyl carrier protein domain of either subunit. Treatment of animal fatty acid synthase dimers with dibromopropanone generates three new molecular species with decreased electrophoretic mobilities; none of these species are formed by fatty acid synthase mutant dimers lacking either the active-site cysteine of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain (C161A) or the phosphopantetheine thiol of the acyl carrier protein domain (S2151A). A double affinity-labeling strategy was used to isolate dimers that carried one or both mutations on one or both subunits; the heterodimers were treated with dibromopropanone and analyzed by a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, gel filtration, and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Thus the two slowest moving of these species, which accounted for 45 and 15% of the total, were identified as doubly and singly cross-linked dimers, respectively, whereas the fastest moving species, which accounted for 35% of the total, was identified as originating from internally cross-linked subunits. These results show that the two polypeptides of the fatty acid synthase are oriented such that head-to-tail contacts are formed both between and within subunits, and provide the first structural evidence in support of the new model.

20691684|t|p47, a p97-binding protein, functions in Golgi membrane fusion together with p97 and VCIP135, another p97-binding protein. We have succeeded in creating p47 with a point mutation, F253S, which lacks p97-binding affinity. p47 mapping experiments revealed that p47 had two p97-binding regions and the F253S mutation occurred in the first p97-binding site. p47(F253S) could not form a complex with p97 and did not caused any cisternal regrowth in an in vitro Golgi reassembly assay. In addition, mutation corresponding to the p47 F253S mutation in p37 and ufd1 also abolished their binding ability to p97.

9467941|t|Association of Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 E6 oncoprotein with the focal adhesion protein paxillin through a conserved protein interaction motif.
9467941|t|We have found that the E6 oncoprotein of Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 (BE6) as well as the E6 protein of the cancer associated HPV-16 (16E6) interact with the focal adhesion protein paxillin. Mutational analysis of paxillin revealed that BE6 binds paxillin through small protein interaction motifs called LD motifs that have been previously identified as important in regulating association of paxillin with vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and that BE6 can interact with at least two separate binding sites on paxillin. The LD motifs of paxillin that bind BE6 share homology with the E6 binding site of E6-AP, a ubiquitin ligase that together with 16E6 targets the degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor. Paxillin binding to BE6 excludes simultaneous binding to E6-AP. Mutational analysis of BE6 can distinguish the interaction of BE6 with E6-AP compared to paxillin and revealed that the interaction of BE6 with paxillin may be necessary for the induction of anchorage independent growth of cells by BE6.

20493856|t|The scaffold protein JIP3 functions as a downstream effector of the small GTPase ARF6 to regulate neurite morphogenesis of cortical neurons.
20493856|t|The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) plays crucial roles in a wide variety of cell functions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of ARF6-mediated signaling and cellular functions, we sought new ARF6-binding proteins in the mouse brain. We identified the signaling scaffold protein JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), which is exclusively expressed in neurons, as a downstream effector of ARF6. Overexpression of a unique dominant negative mutant of ARF6, which was unable to interact with JIP3, and knockdown of JIP3 in mouse cortical neurons stimulated the elongation and branching of neurites. These results provide evidence that ARF6/JIP3 signaling regulates neurite morphogenesis.

9047334|t|Mapping of functional interactions between domains of the animal fatty acid synthase by mutant complementation in vitro.
9047334|t|Polypeptides of the animal fatty acid synthase (FAS) consist of three amino-terminal catalytic domains, beta-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransacylase, and dehydrase, separated by a 600-residue structural core from four carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase. In the active dimeric form of the protein the two identical multifunctional polypeptides are oriented head-to-tail such that two sites for palmitate synthesis are formed at the subunit interface. In order to map the functional interactions between domains of the two subunits that contribute to the two sites of synthesis, we have utilized a strategy based on complementation analysis in vitro of modified FASs carrying mutations in specific catalytic domains. Homodimeric mutant FASs lacking functional beta-ketoacyl synthase (KS-), dehydrase (DH-), acyl carrier protein (ACP-), or thioesterase (TE-) domains, as well as heterodimers formed between ACP- and TE- subunits, between ACP- and DH- subunits, and between DH- and TE- subunits, were unable to synthesize fatty acids. However, heterodimers formed between KS- and either DH-, ACP-, or TE- subunits regained partial FAS activity. These data indicate that the dehydrase domain, although located in the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide, should be assigned to the complementation group located in the carboxy-terminal half that includes the acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains. Thus, the current model for the animal FAS must be revised to reflect the finding that the two constituent polypeptides are not simply positioned side-by-side in a fully extended conformation but are coiled in a manner that allows the dehydrase domain to access the beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP located more than 1100 residues distant on the same subunit.

10357812|t|Recruitment of an alternatively spliced form of synaptojanin 2 to mitochondria by the interaction with the PDZ domain of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein.
10357812|t|Synaptojanin 1 is an inositol 5'-phosphatase highly enriched in nerve terminals with a putative role in recycling of synaptic vesicles. We have previously described synaptojanin 2, which is more broadly expressed as multiple alternatively spliced forms. Here we have identified and characterized a novel mitochondrial outer membrane protein, OMP25, with a single PDZ domain that specifically binds to a unique motif in the C-terminus of synaptojanin 2A. This motif is encoded by the exon sequence specific to synaptojanin 2A. OMP25 mRNA is widely expressed in rat tissues. OMP25 is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane via the C-terminal transmembrane region, with the PDZ domain facing the cytoplasm. Overexpression of OMP25 results in perinuclear clustering of mitochondria in transfected cells. This effect is mimicked by enforced expression of synaptojanin 2A on the mitochondrial outer membrane, but not by the synaptojanin 2A mutants lacking the inositol 5'-phosphatase domain. Our findings provide evidence that OMP25 mediates recruitment of synaptojanin 2A to mitochondria and that modulation of inositol phospholipids by synaptojanin 2A may play a role in maintenance of the intracellular distribution of mitochondria.

10067897|t|Structure of a DNA-bound Ultrabithorax-Extradenticle homeodomain complex.
10067897|t|During the development of multicellular organisms, gene expression must be tightly regulated, both spatially and temporally. One set of transcription factors that are important in animal development is encoded by the homeotic (Hox) genes, which govern the choice between alternative developmental pathways along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins, such as Drosophila Ultrabithorax, have low DNA-binding specificity by themselves but gain affinity and specificity when they bind together with the homeoprotein Extradenticle (or Pbxl in mammals). To understand the structural basis of Hox-Extradenticle pairing, we determine here the crystal structure of an Ultrabithorax-Extradenticle-DNA complex at 2.4 A resolution, using the minimal polypeptides that form a cooperative heterodimer. The Ultrabithorax and Extradenticle homeodomains bind opposite faces of the DNA, with their DNA-recognition helices almost touching each other. However, most of the cooperative interactions arise from the YPWM amino-acid motif of Ultrabithorax-located amino-terminally to its homeodomain-which forms a reverse turn and inserts into a hydrophobic pocket on the Extradenticle homeodomain surface. Together, these protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions define the general principles by which homeotic proteins interact with Extradenticle (or Pbx1) to affect development along the anterior-posterior axis of animals.

19749176|t|Distinct subsets of Sit4 holophosphatases are required for inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth by rapamycin and zymocin.
19749176|t|Protein phosphatase Sit4 is required for growth inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the antifungals rapamycin and zymocin. Here, we show that the rapamycin effector Tap42, which interacts with Sit4, is dispensable for zymocin action. Although Tap42 binding-deficient sit4 mutants are resistant to zymocin, these mutations also block interaction between Sit4 and the Sit4-associating proteins Sap185 and Sap190, previously shown to mediate zymocin toxicity. Among the four different SAP genes, we found that SAP190 deletions specifically induce rapamycin resistance but that this phenotype is reversed in the additional absence of SAP155. Similarly, the rapamycin resistance of an rrd1Delta mutant lacking the Sit4 interactor Rrd1 specifically requires the Sit4/Sap190 complex. Thus, Sit4/Sap190 and Sit4/Sap155 holophosphatases apparently play opposing roles following rapamycin treatment, although rapamycin inhibition is operational in the absence of all Sap family members or Sit4. We further identified a Sit4-interacting region on Sap185 in sap190Delta cells that mediates Sit4/Sap185 complex formation and is essential for dephosphorylation of Elp1, a subunit of the Elongator complex. This suggests that Sit4/Sap185 and Sit4/Sap190 holophosphatases promote Elongator functions, a notion supported by data showing that their inactivation eliminates Elongator-dependent processes, including tRNA suppression by SUP4 and tRNA cleavage by zymocin.

18093972|t|Ubiquitination and degradation of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 by WD40 repeat/SOCS box protein WSB-1.
18093972|t|Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a member of the nuclear protein kinase family, which induces both p53- and CtBP-mediated apoptosis. Levels of HIPK2 were increased by UV irradiation and cisplatin treatment, thereby implying the degradation of HIPK2 in cells under normal conditions. Here, we indicate that HIPK2 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the WD40-repeat/SOCS box protein WSB-1, a process that is blocked under DNA damage conditions. Yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted to identify the proteins that interact with HIPK2. WSB-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was characterized as an HIPK2-interacting protein. The coexpression of WSB-1 resulted in the degradation of HIPK2 via its C-terminal region. Domain analysis of WSB-1 showed that WD40-repeats and the SOCS box were required for its interaction with and degradation of HIPK2, respectively. In support of the degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1, HIPK2 was polyubiquitinated by WSB-1 in vitro and in vivo. The knockdown of endogenous WSB-1 with the expression of short hairpin RNA against WSB-1 increases the stability of endogenous HIPK2 and resulted in the accumulation of HIPK2. The ubiquitination and degradation of HIPK2 by WSB-1 was inhibited completely via the administration of DNA damage reagents, including Adriamycin and cisplatin. These findings effectively illustrate the regulatory mechanisms by which HIPK2 is maintained at a low level, by WSB-1 in cells under normal conditions, and stabilized by genotoxic stresses.

20547845|t|A critical cysteine is required for HMGB1 binding to Toll-like receptor 4 and activation of macrophage cytokine release.
20547845|t|During infection, vertebrates develop "sickness syndrome," characterized by fever, anorexia, behavioral withdrawal, acute-phase protein responses, and inflammation. These pathophysiological responses are mediated by cytokines, including TNF and IL-1, released during the innate immune response to invasion. Even in the absence of infection, qualitatively similar physiological syndromes occur following sterile injury, ischemia reperfusion, crush injury, and autoimmune-mediated tissue damage. Recent advances implicate high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear protein with inflammatory cytokine activities, in stimulating cytokine release. HMGB1 is passively released during cell injury and necrosis, or actively secreted during immune cell activation, positioning it at the intersection of sterile and infection-associated inflammation. To date, eight candidate receptors have been implicated in mediating the biological responses to HMGB1, but the mechanism of HMGB1-dependent cytokine release is unknown. Here we show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pivotal receptor for activation of innate immunity and cytokine release, is required for HMGB1-dependent activation of macrophage TNF release. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicate that HMGB1 binds specifically to TLR4, and that this binding requires a cysteine in position 106. A wholly synthetic 20-mer peptide containing cysteine 106 from within the cytokine-stimulating B box mediates TLR4-dependent activation of macrophage TNF release. Inhibition of TLR4 binding with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAb or by mutating cysteine 106 prevents HMGB1 activation of cytokine release. These results have implications for rationale, design, and development of experimental therapeutics for use in sterile and infectious inflammation.

11069292|t|Phytochrome B binds with greater apparent affinity than phytochrome A to the basic helix-loop-helix factor PIF3 in a reaction requiring the PAS domain of PIF3.
11069292|t|The signaling pathways by which the phytochrome (phy) family of photoreceptors transmits sensory information to light-regulated genes remain to be fully defined. Evidence for a relatively direct pathway has been provided by the binding of one member of the family, phyB, to a promoter-element-bound, basic helix-loop-helix protein, PIF3, specifically upon light-induced conversion of the photoreceptor molecule to its biologically active conformer (Pfr). Here, we show that phyA also binds selectively and reversibly to PIF3 upon photoconversion to Pfr, but that the apparent affinity of PIF3 for phyA is 10-fold lower than for phyB. This result is consistent with previous in vivo data from PIF3-deficient Arabidopsis, indicating that PIF3 has a major role in phyB signaling, but a more minor role in phyA signaling. We also show that phyB binds stoichiometrically to PIF3 at an equimolar ratio, suggesting that the resultant complex is the unit active in transcriptional regulation at target promoters. Deletion mapping suggests that a 37-aa segment present at the N terminus of phyB, but absent from phyA, contributes strongly to the high binding affinity of phyB for PIF3. Conversely, deletion mapping and point mutation analysis of PIF3 for determinants involved in recognition of phyB indicates that the PAS domain of PIF3 is a major contributor to this interaction, but that a second determinant in the C-terminal domain is also necessary.

23957209|t|Phosphorylation of Noxo1 at threonine 341 regulates its interaction with Noxa1 and the superoxide-producing activity of Nox1.
23957209|t|Superoxide production by Nox1, a member of the Nox family NAPDH oxidases, requires expression of its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and Noxa1 (Nox activator 1) and is markedly enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC). The mechanism underlying PMA-induced enhancement of Nox1 activity, however, remains to be elucidated. Here we show that, in response to PMA, Noxo1 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, which is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Among them, Thr341 in Noxo1 is directly phosphorylated by PKC in  vitro, and alanine substitution for this residue reduces not only PMA-induced Noxo1 phosphorylation but also PMA-dependent enhancement of Nox1-catalyzed superoxide production. Phosphorylation of Thr341 allows Noxo1 to sufficiently interact with Noxa1, an interaction that participates in Nox1 activation. Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 appears to play a crucial role in PMA-elicited activation of Nox1, providing a molecular link between PKC-mediated signal transduction and Nox1-catalyzed superoxide production. Furthermore, Ser154 in Noxo1 is phosphorylated in both resting and PMA-stimulated cells, and the phosphorylation probably participates in a PMA-independent constitutive activity of Nox1. Ser154 may also be involved in protein kinase A (PKA) mediated regulation of Nox1; this serine is the major residue that is phosphorylated by PKA in  vitro. Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 and at Ser154 appears to regulate Nox1 activity in different manners.

20890284|t|The structural basis for intramembrane assembly of an activating immunoreceptor complex.
20890284|t|Many receptors that activate cells of the immune system are multisubunit membrane protein complexes in which ligand recognition and signaling functions are contributed by separate protein modules. Receptors and signaling subunits assemble through contacts among basic and acidic residues in their transmembrane domains to form the functional complexes. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the membrane-embedded, heterotrimeric assembly formed by association of the DAP12 signaling module with the natural killer (NK) cell-activating receptor NKG2C. The main intramembrane contact site is formed by a complex electrostatic network involving five hydrophilic transmembrane residues. Functional mutagenesis demonstrated that similar polar intramembrane motifs are also important for assembly of the NK cell-activating NKG2D-DAP10 complex and the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-invariant signaling protein CD3 complex. This structural motif therefore lies at the core of the molecular organization of many activating immunoreceptors.

9194564|t|Synergistic activation of transcription by CBP and p53.
9194564|t|The tumour suppressor p53 is a transcriptional regulator whose ability to inhibit cell growth is dependent upon its transactivation function. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CBP, which is also implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation, acts as a p53 coactivator and potentiates its transcriptional activity. The amino-terminal activation domain of p53 interacts with the carboxy-terminal portion of the CBP protein both in vitro and in vivo. In transfected SaoS-2 cells, CBP potentiates activation of the mdm-2 gene by p53 and, reciprocally, p53 potentiates activation of a Gal4-responsive target gene by a Gal4(1-147)-CBP(1678-2441) fusion protein. A double point mutation that destroys the transactivation function of p53 also abolishes its binding to CBP and its synergistic function with CBP. The ability of p53 to interact physically and functionally with a coactivator (CBP) that has histone acetyltransferase activity and with components (TAFs) of the general transcription machinery indicates that it may have different functions in a multistep activation pathway.

18974936|t|Stress induced and nuclear localized HIPP26 from Arabidopsis thaliana interacts via its heavy metal associated domain with the drought stress related zinc finger transcription factor ATHB29.
18974936|t|HIPP26 from Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to a novel class of plant proteins, characterized by a heavy metal associated domain and an additional isoprenylation motif. It is induced during cold, salt and drought stress. The nuclear localization of HIPP26, predicted by a NLS motif, could be confirmed in onion epidermal cells overexpressing GFP-HIPP26. Experiments with modified HIPP26 indicate that the isoprenylation plays a role in the spatial distribution in the nucleus. Using promoter-GUS constructs, a tissue specific expression pattern of HIPP26 could be shown, with high expression in the vascular tissue. By a yeast-two-hybrid approach a strong interaction of HIPP26 with the zinc finger homeodomain transcription factor ATHB29, which is known to play a role in dehydration stress response could be detected. This was confirmed by GST pull-down assays. When using a modified HIPP26 lacking the two central cysteines of the heavy metal associated domain, ATHB29 was not bound in the GST pull-down assay, indicating that this structure is necessary for the interaction. Further yeast-two-hybrid analyses testing interaction of different members of the HIPP family with related zinc finger transcription factors revealed a specific interaction of ATHB29 with several HIPP proteins. A functional relationship between HIPP26 and ATHB29 is also indicated by experiments with mutants of HIPP26 showing altered expression levels of such genes known to be regulated by ATHB29.

9414278|t|Factor VII deficiency caused by a structural variant N57D of the first epidermal growth factor domain.
9414278|t|We have previously described a kindred with factor VII (FVII) deficiency whose members exhibited reduced procoagulant activity relative to FVII antigen concentration. In this report, the molecular genetic basis of the FVII defect has been determined to be a heterozygous substitution of Asp for Asn at position 57 in the first epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. Recombinant FVII (N57D) cDNA was created by site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed in human 293 cells. The transfected cells synthesized an immunoprecipitable protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50 kD. Quantitation of expression by FVII enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that mutant protein yields were consistently low, typically 10% to 30% of wild-type FVII. FVII (N57D) protein did not accumulate intracellularly, and Northern blot analysis indicated equivalent FVII mRNA levels in 293 cells expressing either wild-type FVII or FVII (N57D). Secreted FVII (N57D) protein did not bind tissue factor, exhibited no procoagulant activity, and failed to bind a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody specific for the first EGF domain of FVII. Molecular modeling of the first EGF domain of FVII predicted that the N57D amino acid substitution would disrupt tertiary bonding structure. We conclude that the N57D mutation affects folding of the first EGF domain of FVII resulting in decreased cellular secretion of a mutant FVII molecule, which is unable to bind tissue factor and is therefore biologically inactive.

10675337|t|The novel coactivator C1 (HCF) coordinates multiprotein enhancer formation and mediates transcription activation by GABP.
10675337|t|Transcription of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early (IE) genes is determined by multiprotein enhancer complexes. The core enhancer assembly requires the interactions of the POU-homeodomain protein Oct-1, the viral transactivator alphaTIF and the cellular factor C1 (HCF). In this context, the C1 factor interacts with each protein to assemble the stable enhancer complex. In addition, the IE enhancer cores contain adjacent binding sites for other cellular transcription factors such as Sp1 and GA-binding protein (GABP). In this study, a direct interaction of the C1 factor with GABP is demonstrated, defining the C1 factor as the critical coordinator of the enhancer complex assembly. In addition, mutations that reduce the GABP transactivation potential also impair the C1-GABP interaction, indicating that the C1 factor functions as a novel coactivator of GABP-mediated transcription. The interaction and coordinated assembly of the enhancer proteins by the C1 factor may be critical for the regulation of the HSV lytic-latent cycle.

19682074|t|A single intersubunit salt bridge affects oligomerization and catalytic activity in a bacterial quinone reductase.
19682074|t|YhdA, a thermostable NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase from Bacillus subtilis, reduces quinones via a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with a pronounced preference for NADPH. The enzyme occurs as a stable tetramer in solution. The two extended dimer surfaces are packed against each other by a 90 rotation of one dimer with respect to the other. This assembly is stabilized by the formation of four salt bridges between K109 and D137 of the neighbouring protomers. To investigate the importance of the ion pair contacts, the K109L and D137L single replacement variants, as well as the K109L/D137L and K109D/D137K double replacement variants, were generated, expressed, purified, crystallized and biochemically characterized. The K109L and D137L variants form dimers instead of tetramers, whereas the K109L/D137L and K109D/D137K variants appear to exist in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium in solution. The crystal structures of the K109L and D137L variants confirm the dimeric state, with the K109L/D137L and K109D/D137K variants adopting a tetrameric assembly. Interestingly, all protein variants show a drastically reduced quinone reductase activity in steady-state kinetics. Detailed analysis of the two half reactions revealed that the oxidative half reaction is not affected, whereas reduction of the bound FMN cofactor by NADPH is virtually abolished. Inspection of the crystal structures indicates that the side chain of K109 plays a dual role by forming a salt bridge to D137, as well as stabilizing a glycine-rich loop in the vicinity of the FMN cofactor. In all protein variants, this glycine-rich loop exhibits a much higher mobility, compared to the wild-type. This appears to be incompatible with NADPH binding and thus leads to abrogation of flavin reduction.

20453063|t|CHD8 interacts with CHD7, a protein which is mutated in CHARGE syndrome.
20453063|t|CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused in about two-third of cases by mutations in the CHD7 gene. For other genetic diseases e.g. hereditary spastic paraplegia, it was shown that interacting partners are involved in the underlying cause of the disease. These data encouraged us to search for CHD7 binding partners by a yeast two-hybrid library screen and CHD8 was identified as an interacting partner. The result was confirmed by a direct yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation studies and by a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. To investigate the function of CHD7 missense mutations in the CHD7-CHD8 interacting area on the binding capacity of both proteins, we included three known missense mutations (p.His2096Arg, p.Val2102Ile and p.Gly2108Arg) and one newly identified missense mutation (p.Trp2091Arg) in the CHD7 gene and performed both direct yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies. In the direct yeast two-hybrid system, the CHD7-CHD8 interaction was disrupted by the missense mutations p.Trp2091Arg, p.His2096Arg and p.Gly2108Arg, whereas in the co-immunoprecipitation studies disruption of the CHD7-CHD8 interaction by the mutations could not be observed. The results lead to the hypothesis that CHD7 and CHD8 proteins are interacting directly and indirectly via additional linker proteins. Disruption of the direct CHD7-CHD8 interaction might change the conformation of a putative large CHD7-CHD8 complex and could be a disease mechanism in CHARGE syndrome.

11423549|t|Analysis of the alpha-actinin/zyxin interaction.
11423549|t|The yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for interaction partners of human zyxin. Screening of two different cDNA libraries, one prepared from human placenta, the other from human heart, yielded several positive clones that occurred in both searches, including clones coding for cyclophilin, nebulette, and alpha-actinin. The zyxin/alpha-actinin interaction was analyzed in detail. By site-directed mutagenesis, a linear motif of 6 amino acids (Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Val-Ala) present at the N terminus of zyxin was found to play a critical role. Replacement of a single amino acid within this motif abolished binding to alpha-actinin in blot overlays as well as in living cells. On the other hand, the interaction site in alpha-actinin was mapped to a conformational determinant present in the center of the protein as demonstrated by a fragment deletion analysis. This binding site involved a tandem array of two complete spectrin-like domains. Only fragments that were able to dimerize in yeast also bound to zyxin, suggesting that dimerization of alpha-actinin is essential for zyxin binding.

17012600|t|NDR1 interaction with RIN4 mediates the differential activation of multiple disease resistance pathways in Arabidopsis.
17012600|t|Recognition of pathogens by plants involves the coordinated efforts of molecular chaperones, disease resistance (R) proteins, and components of disease resistance signaling pathways. Characterization of events associated with pathogen perception in Arabidopsis thaliana has advanced understanding of molecular genetic mechanisms associated with disease resistance and protein interactions critical for the activation of resistance signaling. Regulation of R protein-mediated signaling in response to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis involves the physical association of at least two R proteins with the negative regulator RPM1 INTERACTING PROTEIN4 (RIN4). While the RIN4-RPS2 (for RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE2) and RIN4-RPM1 (for RESISTANCE TO P. SYRINGAE PV MACULICOLA1) signaling pathways exhibit differential mechanisms of activation in terms of effector action, the requirement for NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1) is shared. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, followed by a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that the RIN4-NDR1 interaction occurs on the cytoplasmically localized N-terminal portion of NDR1 and that this interaction is required for the activation of resistance signaling following infection by P. syringae expressing the Cys protease Type III effector protein AvrRpt2. We demonstrate that like RPS2 and RPM1, NDR1 also associates with RIN4 in planta. We suggest that this interaction serves to further regulate activation of disease resistance signaling following recognition of P. syringae DC3000-AvrRpt2 by Arabidopsis.

17280616|t|Involvement of maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) in mammary carcinogenesis through interaction with Bcl-G, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family.
17280616|t|INTRODUCTION: Cancer therapies directed at specific molecular targets in signaling pathways of cancer cells, such as tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab, have proven useful for treatment of advanced breast cancers. However, increased risk of endometrial cancer with long-term tamoxifen administration and of bone fracture due to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy are recognized side effects. These side effects as well as drug resistance make it necessary to search for novel molecular targets for drugs on the basis of well-characterized mechanisms of action. METHODS: Using accurate genome-wide expression profiles of breast cancers, we found maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) to be significantly overexpressed in the great majority of breast cancer cells. To assess whether MELK has a role in mammary carcinogenesis, we knocked down the expression of endogenous MELK in breast cancer cell lines using mammalian vector-based RNA interference. Furthermore, we identified a long isoform of Bcl-G (Bcl-GL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a possible substrate for MELK by pull-down assay with recombinant wild-type and kinase-dead MELK. Finally, we performed TUNEL assays and FACS analysis, measuring proportions of apoptotic cells, to investigate whether MELK is involved in the apoptosis cascade through the Bcl-GL-related pathway. RESULTS: Northern blot analyses on multiple human tissues and cancer cell lines demonstrated that MELK was overexpressed at a significantly high level in a great majority of breast cancers and cell lines, but was not expressed in normal vital organs (heart, liver, lung and kidney). Suppression of MELK expression by small interfering RNA significantly inhibited growth of human breast cancer cells. We also found that MELK physically interacted with Bcl-GL through its amino-terminal region. Immunocomplex kinase assay showed that Bcl-GL was specifically phosphorylated by MELK in vitro. TUNEL assays and FACS analysis revealed that overexpression of wild-type MELK suppressed Bcl-GL-induced apoptosis, while that of D150A-MELK did not. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the kinase activity of MELK is likely to affect mammary carcinogenesis through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bcl-GL. The kinase activity of MELK could be a promising molecular target for development of therapy for patients with breast cancers.

15067009|t|Dimerization of the transmembrane domain of Integrin alphaIIb subunit in cell membranes.
15067009|t|Homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions between the transmembrane (TM) helices of integrin alpha and beta subunits may play an important role in integrin activation and clustering. As a first step to understanding these interactions, we used the TOXCAT assay to measure oligomerization of the wild-type alpha(IIb) TM helix and single-site TM domain mutants. TOXCAT measures the oligomerization of a chimeric protein containing a TM helix in the Escherichia coli inner membrane via the transcriptional activation of the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. We found the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase induced by the wild-type alpha(IIb) TM helix was approximately half that induced by the strongly dimerizing TM helix of glycophorin A, confirming that the alpha(IIb) TM domain oligomerizes in biological membranes. Mutating each of the alpha(IIb) TM domain residues to either Ala, Leu, Ile, or Val revealed that a GXXXG motif mediates oligomerization. Further, we found that the residue preceding each glycine contributed to the oligomerization interface, as did the residue at position i + 4 after the second Gly of GXXXG. Thus, the sequence XXVGXXGGXXXLXX is critical for oligomerization of alpha(IIb) TM helix. These data were used to generate an atomic model of the alpha(IIb) homodimer, revealing a family of structures with right-handed crossing angles of 40 degrees to 60 degrees, consistent with a 4.0-residue periodicity, and with an interface rotated by 50 degrees relative to glycophorin A. Thus, although the alpha(IIb) TM helix makes use of the GXXXG framework, neighboring residues have evolved to engineer its dimerization interface, enabling it to subserve specific and specialized functions.

12351681|t|A heterotrimeric death domain complex in Toll signaling.
12351681|t|Signaling from the transmembrane receptor Toll to Rel-related transcription factors regulates dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo, as well as larval and adult immunity. To identify additional pathway components, we have used double-stranded RNA interference to investigate Drosophila counterparts of genes that regulate the mammalian Rel family member NF-kappaB. Experiments in cultured cells reveal that the fly orthologue of the adaptor protein MyD88 is essential for signal transduction from Toll to a second adaptor protein, Tube. By using coimmunoprecipitation studies, we find a heterotrimeric association of the death domains of MyD88, Tube, and the protein kinase Pelle. Site-directed mutational analyses of interaction sites defined by crystallographic studies demonstrate that Tube recruits MyD88 and Pelle into the heterotrimer by two distinct binding surfaces on the Tube death domain. Furthermore, functional assays confirm that the formation of this heterotrimer is critical for signal transduction by the Toll pathway.

16247757|t|Thymopoietin (lamina-associated polypeptide 2) gene mutation associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.
16247757|t|Thymopoietin or TMPO (indicated by its alternative gene symbol, LAP2, in this work) has been proposed as a candidate disease gene for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), since a LAP2 product associates with nucleoplasmic lamins A/C, which are encoded by the DCM gene LMNA. We developed a study to screen for genetic mutations in LAP2 in a large collection of DCM patients and families. A total of 113 subjects from 88 families (56 with familial DCM (FDC) and 32 with sporadic DCM) were screened for LAP2 mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis. We found a single putative mutation affecting the LAP2alpha isoform in one FDC pedigree. The mutation predicts an Arg690Cys substitution (c.2068C>T; p.R690C) located in the C-terminal domain of the LAP2alpha protein, a region that is known to interact with lamin A/C. RT-PCR, Western blot analyses, and immunolocalization revealed low-level LAP2alpha expression in adult cardiac muscle, and localization to a subset of nuclei. Mutated Arg690Cys LAP2alpha expressed in HeLa cells localized to the nucleoplasm like wild-type LAP2alpha, with no effect on peripheral and nucleoplasmic lamin A distribution. However, the in vitro interaction of mutated LAP2alpha with the pre-lamin A C-terminus was significantly compromised compared to the wild-type protein. LAP2 mutations may represent a rare cause of DCM. The Arg690Cys mutation altered the observed LAP2alpha interaction with A-type lamins. Our finding implicates a novel nuclear lamina-associated protein in the pathogenesis of genetic forms of dilated cardiomyopathy.

20181956|t|Poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) is involved in multiple aspects of mRNA processing and translation. It is a component of RNA stress granules and binds the RNA-induced silencing complex to promote degradation of silenced mRNAs. Here, we report the crystal structures of the C-terminal Mlle (or PABC) domain in complex with peptides from GW182 (TNRC6C) and Ataxin-2. The structures reveal overlapping binding sites but with unexpected diversity in the peptide conformation and residues involved in binding. The mutagenesis and binding studies show low to submicromolar binding affinity with overlapping but distinct specificity determinants. These results rationalize the role of the Mlle domain of PABPC1 in microRNA-mediated mRNA deadenylation and suggest a more general function in the assembly of cytoplasmic RNA granules.

23164639|t|Functional interaction of glutathione S-transferase pi and peroxiredoxin 6 in intact cells.
23164639|t|Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is a 1-Cys member of the peroxiredoxin superfamily that plays an important role in antioxidant defense. Glutathionylation of recombinant Prdx6 mediated by    glutathione S-transferase (GST) is required for reduction of the oxidized Cys and completion of the peroxidatic catalytic cycle in vitro. This study investigated the requirement for   GST in intact cells. Transfection with a plasmid construct expressing   GST into MCF7, a cell line that lacks endogenous   GST, significantly increased phospholipid peroxidase activity as measured in cell lysates and protected intact cells against a peroxidative stress. siRNA knockdown indicated that this increased peroxidase activity was Prdx6 dependent. Interaction between   GST and Prdx6, evaluated by the Duolink Proximity Ligation Assay, was minimal under basal conditions but increased dramatically following treatment of cells with the oxidant, tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Interaction was abolished by mutation of C47, the active site for Prdx6 peroxidase activity. Depletion of cellular GSH by treatment of cells with buthionine sulfoximine had no effect on the interaction of Prdx6 and   GST. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in Prdx6 is required for its interaction with   GST and that the interaction plays an important role in regenerating the peroxidase activity of Prdx6.

9038200|t|TOUSLED is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that requires a coiled-coil region for oligomerization and catalytic activity.
9038200|t|The TOUSLED (TSL) gene is essential for the proper morphogenesis of leaves and flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana. Protein sequence analysis predicts TSL is composed of a carboxyl-terminal protein kinase catalytic domain and a large amino-terminal regulatory domain. TSL fusion proteins, expressed in and purified from yeast, were used to demonstrate TSL protein kinase activity in vitro. TSL trans-autophosphorylates on serine and threonine residues, and phosphorylates exogenous substrates. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, TSL was found to oligomerize via its NH2-terminal domain. A deletion series indicates that a region containing two alpha-helical segments predicted to participate in a coiled-coil structure is essential for oligomerization. TSL localizes to the nucleus in plant cells through an essential NH2-terminal nuclear localization signal; however, this signal is not necessary for protein kinase activity. Finally, deletion mutants demonstrate a strict correlation between catalytic activity and the ability to oligomerize, arguing that activation of the protein kinase requires interaction between TSL molecules.

23357641|t|Nephronectin binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans via its MAM domain.
23357641|t|Nephronectin is a basement membrane protein comprising five N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a central linker segment containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif and a C-terminal meprin-A5 protein-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase   (MAM) domain. Nephronectin has been shown to interact with a8b1 integrin through the central linker segment, but its interactions with other molecules remain to be elucidated. Here, we examined the binding of nephronectin to a panel of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Nephronectin bound strongly to heparin and chondroitin sulfate (CS)-E and moderately to heparan sulfate (HS), but failed to bind to CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, dermatan sulfate and hyaluronic acid. Deletion of the MAM domain severely impaired the binding of nephronectin to heparin but not CS-E, whereas deletion of the EGF-like repeats reduced its binding to CS-E but not heparin, suggesting that nephronectin interacts with CS-E and heparin through the EGF-like repeats and MAM domain, respectively. Consistent with these results, nephronectin bound to agrin and perlecan, which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in basement membranes, in HS-dependent manners. Site-directed mutagenesis of the MAM domain revealed that multiple basic amino acid residues in the putative loop regions were involved in the binding of the MAM domain to agrin. The binding of nephronectin to basement membrane HSPGs was further confirmed by in situ nephronectin overlay assays using mouse frozen tissue sections. Taken together, these findings indicate that nephronectin is capable of binding to HSPGs in basement membranes via the MAM domain, and thereby raise the possibility that interactions with basement membrane HSPGs may be involved in the deposition of nephronectin onto basement membranes.

15965644|t|The Q283P amino-acid change in HFE leads to structural and functional consequences similar to those described for the mutated 282Y HFE protein.
15965644|t|In Caucasians, 4-35% of hemochromatosis patients carry at least one chromosome without a common HFE mutation (i.e. C282Y, H63D and S65C). Several studies have now shown that iron overload phenotypes in such patients can be associated with uncommon HFE mutations. We previously supported implication of the C282Y/Q283P compound heterozygous genotype in hemochromatosis phenotypes and, based on molecular dynamics simulations, proposed that the Q283P substitution prevents normal folding of the HFE alpha3-domain. In the current work, we have used HeLa cells carrying wild-type or Q283P-mutant HFE cDNA under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter to functionally characterise the Q283P mutation. Experiments using cells over-expressing wild-type HFE confirm the existence of beta2microglobulin(beta2m)/HFE and HFE/transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) interactions, as well as the capacity of HFE to reduce transferrin-mediated iron uptake. In contrast, neither beta2m/HFE nor HFE/TfR1 complex formation was detected in cells over-expressing the mutated form of HFE. Moreover, the 283P HFE protein was found to have a very limited effect on the major cellular iron uptake pathway. Combined, our results indicate that the Q283P mutation leads to structural and functional consequences similar to those described for the main hereditary hemochromatosis mutation. As a consequence, our study has implications for the screening of hemochromatosis patients that have one or two copies of HFE which lack the main mutations. It also highlights that protein structure prediction methods could be more generally used to better interpret relationships between rare genotypes and molecular diagnosis of a human inherited disorder.

23901104|t|Structural basis of Vps33A recruitment to the human HOPS complex by Vps16.
23901104|t|The multisubunit homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) membrane-tethering complex is required for late endosome-lysosome and autophagosome-lysosome fusion in mammals. We have determined the crystal structure of the human HOPS subunit Vps33A, confirming its identity as a Sec1/Munc18 family member. We show that HOPS subunit Vps16 recruits Vps33A to the human HOPS complex and that residues 642-736 are necessary and sufficient for this interaction, and we present the crystal structure of Vps33A in complex with Vps16(642-736). Mutations at the binding interface disrupt the Vps33A-Vps16 interaction both in vitro and in cells, preventing recruitment of Vps33A to the HOPS complex. The Vps33A-Vps16 complex provides a structural framework for studying the association between Sec1/Munc18 proteins and tethering complexes.

16443932|t|Apolipoprotein A-I activates Cdc42 signaling through the ABCA1 transporter.
16443932|t|It has been suggested that the signal transduction initiated by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) activates key proteins involved in cholesterol efflux. ABCA1 serves as a binding partner for apoA-I, but its participation in apoA-I-induced signaling remains uncertain. We show that the exposure of human fibroblasts to ABCA1 ligands (apolipoproteins and amphipathic helical peptides) results in the generation of intracellular signals, including activation of the small G-protein Cdc42, protein kinases (PAK-1 and p54JNK), and actin polymerization. ApoA-I-induced signaling was abrogated by glyburide, an inhibitor of the ABC transporter family, and in fibroblasts from patients with Tangier disease, which do not express ABCA1. Conversely, induction of ABCA1 expression with the liver X receptor agonist, T0901317, and the retinoid X receptor agonist, R0264456, potentiated apoA-I-induced signaling. Similar effects were observed in HEK293 cells overexpressing ABCA1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, but not ABCA1-GFP (K939M), which fails to hydrolyze ATP, or a nonfunctional ABCA1-GFP with a truncated C terminus. We further found that Cdc42 coimmunoprecipitates with ABCA1 in ABCA1-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells exposed to apoA-I but not in cells expressing ABCA1 mutants. We conclude that ABCA1 transduces signals from apoA-I by complexing and activating Cdc42 and downstream kinases and, therefore, acts as a full apoA-I receptor.

21242966|t|Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SCF(Fbx4) dimerization and activity involves a novel component, 14-3-3  .
21242966|t|Fbx4 is an F-box constituent of Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases that directs ubiquitylation of cyclin D1. Ubiquitylation of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation of both cyclin D1 and Fbx4 by GSK3b. GSK3b-mediated phosphorylation of Fbx4 Ser12 during the G1/S transition regulates Fbx4 dimerization, which in turn governs Fbx4-driven E3 ligase activity. In esophageal carcinomas that overexpress cyclin D1, Fbx4 is subject to inactivating mutations that specifically disrupt dimerization, highlighting the biological significance of this regulatory mechanism. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate dimerization, we sought to identify proteins that differentially bind to wild-type Fbx4 versus a cancer-derived dimerization-deficient mutant. We provide evidence that phosphorylation of Ser12 generates a docking site for 14-3-3  . 14-3-3   binds to endogenous Fbx4 and this association is impaired by mutations that target either Ser8 or Ser12 in Fbx4, suggesting that this N-terminal motif in Fbx4 directs its interaction with 14-3-3  . Knockdown of 14-3-3   inhibited Fbx4 dimerization, reduced SCF(Fbx4) E3 ligase activity and stabilized cyclin D1. Collectively, the current results suggest a model wherein 14-3-3   binds to Ser12-phosphorylated Fbx4 to mediate dimerization and function.

11454208|t|The negative regulator Opi1 of phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast contacts the pleiotropic repressor Sin3 and the transcriptional activator Ino2.
11454208|t|Structural genes of phospholipid biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are transcriptionally co-regulated by ICRE (inositol/choline-responsive element) promoter motifs. Gene activation by an ICRE is mediated by binding of the Ino2/Ino4 transcription factor, whereas repression in the presence of high concentrations of inositol and choline (IC) requires an intact Opi1 repressor. However, the mechanism of specific repression and the functional interplay among these regulators remained unclear from previous work. Using in vivo as well as in vitro interaction assays, we show binding of the pleiotropic repressor Sin3 to the pathway-specific regulator Opi1. The paired amphipathic helix 1 (PAH1) within Sin3 and OSID (Opi1-Sin3 interaction domain) in the N-terminus of Opi1 were mapped as contact sites. The regulatory significance of the Opi1-Sin3 interaction was shown by the obvious deregulation of an ICRE-dependent reporter gene in a sin3 mutant. Opi1 also interacts with a newly identified functional domain of the transcriptional activator Ino2 (RID, repressor interaction domain). These results define the molecular composition of the transcription complex mediating control of ICRE-dependent genes and allow a hypothesis on the flow of regulatory information in response to phospholipid precursors.

18647389|t|The central proline rich region of POB1/REPS2 plays a regulatory role in epidermal growth factor receptor endocytosis by binding to 14-3-3 and SH3 domain-containing proteins.
18647389|t|BACKGROUND: The human POB1/REPS2 (Partner of RalBP1) protein is highly conserved in mammals where it has been suggested to function as a molecular scaffold recruiting proteins involved in vesicular traffic and linking them to the actin cytoskeleton remodeling machinery. More recently POB1/REPS2 was found highly expressed in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines, while one of its isoforms (isoform 2) is down regulated during prostate cancer progression. RESULTS: In this report we characterize the central proline rich domain of POB1/REPS2 and we describe for the first time its functional role in receptor endocytosis. We show that the ectopic expression of this domain has a dominant negative effect on the endocytosis of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while leaving transferrin receptor endocytosis unaffected. By a combination of different approaches (phage display, bioinformatics predictions, peptide arrays, mutagenic analysis, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation), we have identified two closely spaced binding motifs for 14-3-3 and for the SH3 of the proteins Amphiphysin II and Grb2. Differently from wild type, proline rich domains that are altered in these motifs do not inhibit EGFR endocytosis, suggesting that these binding motifs play a functional role in this process. CONCLUSION: Our findings are relevant to the characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of POB1/REPS2, SH3 and 14-3-3 proteins in receptor endocytosis, suggesting that 14-3-3 could work by bridging the EGF receptor and the scaffold protein POB1/REPS2.

11777938|t|Polo boxes and Cut23 (Apc8) mediate an interaction between polo kinase and the anaphase-promoting complex for fission yeast mitosis.
11777938|t|The fission yeast plo1(+) gene encodes a polo-like kinase, a member of a conserved family of kinases which play multiple roles during the cell cycle. We show that Plo1 kinase physically interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)/cyclosome through the noncatalytic domain of Plo1 and the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of the subunit, Cut23. A new cut23 mutation, which specifically disrupts the interaction with Plo1, results in a metaphase arrest. This arrest can be rescued by high expression of Plo1 kinase. We suggest that this physical interaction is crucial for mitotic progression by targeting polo kinase activity toward the APC.

21681199|t|The osmoregulated betaine transporter BetP is a stable trimer. Structural studies have shown that individual protomers can adopt distinct transport conformations, implying a functional role for the trimeric state in transport, although the role of trimerization in regulation is not yet understood. We designed putative monomeric mutants by molecular-dynamics simulations and in silico alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Several mutants including BetP-W101A/T351A were monomeric in detergent as well as in the membrane, as shown by blue native gel electrophoresis, crosslinking and electron microscopy. This monomeric form retains the ability to accumulate betaine, but is no longer regulated by hyperosmotic shock.

18273061|t|Structural basis for a novel intrapeptidyl H-bond and reverse binding of c-Cbl-TKB domain substrates.
18273061|t|The c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding domain (Cbl-TKB), essentially an 'embedded' SH2 domain, has a critical role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination. To address how this domain can bind to disparate recognition mofits and to determine whether this results in variations in substrate-binding affinity, we compared crystal structures of the Cbl-TKB domain complexed with phosphorylated peptides of Sprouty2, Sprouty4, epidermal growth factor receptor, Syk, and c-Met receptors and validated the binding with point-mutational analyses using full-length proteins. An obligatory, intrapeptidyl H-bond between the phosphotyrosine and the conserved asparagine or adjacent arginine is essential for binding and orients the peptide into a positively charged pocket on c-Cbl. Surprisingly, c-Met bound to Cbl in the reverse direction, which is unprecedented for SH2 domain binding. The necessity of this intrapeptidyl H-bond was confirmed with isothermal titration calorimetry experiments that also showed Sprouty2 to have the highest binding affinity to c-Cbl; this may enable the selective sequestration of c-Cbl from other target proteins.

17881003|t|Characterization of human cardiac calsequestrin and its deleterious mutants.
17881003|t|Mutations of conserved residues of human cardiac calsequestrin (hCSQ2), a high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+-binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, have been associated with catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). In order to understand the molecular mechanism and pathophysiological link between these CPVT-related missense mutations of hCSQ2 and the resulting arrhythmias, we generated three CPVT-causing mutants of hCSQ2 (R33Q, L167H, and D307H) and two non-pathological mutants (T66A and V76M) and investigated the effect of these mutations. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of the corresponding wild-type hCSQ2 to gain insight into the structural effects of those mutations. Our data show clearly that all three CPVT-related mutations lead to significant reduction in Ca2+-binding capacity in spite of the similarity of their secondary structures to that of the wild-type hCSQ2. Light-scattering experiments indicate that the Ca2+-dependent monomer-polymer transitions of the mutants are quite different, confirming that the linear polymerization behavior of CSQ is linked directly to its high-capacity Ca2+ binding. R33Q and D307H mutations result in a monomer that appears to be unable to form a properly oriented dimer. On the other hand, the L167H mutant has a disrupted hydrophobic core in domain II, resulting in high molecular aggregates, which cannot respond to Ca2+. Although one of the non-pathological mutants, T66A, shares characteristics with the wild-type, the other null mutant, V76M, shows significantly altered Ca2+-binding and polymerization behaviors, calling for careful reconsideration of its status.

20972459|t|WW domain-mediated interaction with Wbp2 is important for the oncogenic property of TAZ.
20972459|t|The transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ are downstream targets inhibited by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. YAP and TAZ both possess WW domains, which are important protein-protein interaction modules that mediate interaction with proline-rich motifs, most commonly PPXY. The WW domains of YAP have complex regulatory roles as exemplified by recent reports showing that they can positively or negatively influence YAP activity in a cell and context-specific manner. In this study, we show that the WW domain of TAZ is important for it to transform both MCF10A and NIH3T3 cells and to activate transcription of ITGB2 but not CTGF, as introducing point mutations into the WW domain of TAZ (WWm) abolished its transforming and transcription-promoting ability. Using a proteomic approach, we discovered potential regulatory proteins that interact with TAZ WW domain and identified Wbp2. The interaction of Wbp2 with TAZ is dependent on the WW domain of TAZ and the PPXY-containing C-terminal region of Wbp2. Knockdown of endogenous Wbp2 suppresses, whereas overexpression of Wbp2 enhances, TAZ-driven transformation. Forced interaction of WWm with Wbp2 by direct C-terminal fusion of full-length Wbp2 or its TAZ-interacting C-terminal domain restored the transforming and transcription-promoting ability of TAZ. These results suggest that the WW domain-mediated interaction with Wbp2 promotes the transforming ability of TAZ.

17932487|t|Interaction of tau protein with the dynactin complex.
17932487|t|Tau is an axonal microtubule-associated protein involved in microtubule assembly and stabilization. Mutations in Tau cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and tau aggregates are present in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. The mechanisms leading from tau dysfunction to neurodegeneration are still debated. The dynein-activator complex dynactin has an essential role in axonal transport and mutations in its gene are associated with lower motor neuron disease. We show here for the first time that the N-terminal projection domain of tau binds to the C-terminus of the p150 subunit of the dynactin complex. Tau and dynactin show extensive colocalization, and the attachment of the dynactin complex to microtubules is enhanced by tau. Mutations of a conserved arginine residue in the N-terminus of tau, found in patients with FTDP-17, affect its binding to dynactin, which is abnormally distributed in the retinal ganglion cell axons of transgenic mice expressing human tau with a mutation in the microtubule-binding domain. These findings, which suggest a direct involvement of tau in axonal transport, have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of tauopathies.

16511572|t|14-3-3gamma binds to MDMX that is phosphorylated by UV-activated Chk1, resulting in p53 activation.
16511572|t|It has been shown that MDMX inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 by primarily cooperating with the p53 feedback regulator MDM2. Here, our study shows that this inhibition can be overcome by 14-3-3gamma and Chk1. 14-3-3gamma was identified as an MDMX-associated protein via an immuno-affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, 14-3-3gamma directly interacted with MDMX in vitro, and this interaction was stimulated by MDMX phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, Chk1 phosphorylated MDMX at serine 367, enhanced the 14-3-3gamma-MDMX binding and the cytoplasmic retaining of MDMX. The Chk1 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these effects. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3gamma, but not its mutant K50E, which did not bind to MDMX, suppressed MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination, leading to p53 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of 14-3-3gamma by siRNA reduced UV-induced p53 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate 14-3-3gamma and Chk1 as two novel regulators of MDMX in response to UV irradiation.

15546359|t|The IAA1 protein is encoded by AXR5 and is a substrate of SCF(TIR1).
15546359|t|Recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins: the auxin (Aux) response factors (ARFs), the Aux/IAAs, and the F-box protein TIR1. The ARF proteins bind DNA and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the Aux/IAA proteins repress ARF function. TIR1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of Aux/IAA proteins. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of Arabidopsis called axr5-1. Mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin-related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms. Further, the axr5-1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin-regulated transcription. The molecular cloning of AXR5 revealed that the gene encodes the IAA1 protein, a member of the Aux/IAA family of proteins. AXR5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype. The axr5-1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain II of the protein, similar to gain-of-function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family. Biochemical studies show that IAA1/AXR5 interacts with TIR1 in an auxin-dependent manner. The mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of IAA1/AXR5. Our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the Aux/IAA family are targeted for degradation by SCFTIR1 in response to auxin.

10629049|t|Mutations in host cell factor 1 separate its role in cell proliferation from recruitment of VP16 and LZIP.
10629049|t|Host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) is a nuclear protein required for progression through G(1) phase of the cell cycle and, via its association with VP16, transcriptional activation of the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes. Both functions require a six-bladed beta-propeller domain encoded by residues 1 to 380 of HCF-1 as well as an additional amino-terminal region. The beta-propeller domain is well conserved in HCF homologues, consistent with a critical cellular function. To date, the only known cellular target of the beta-propeller is a bZIP transcription factor known as LZIP or Luman. Whether the interaction between HCF-1 and LZIP is required for cell proliferation remains to be determined. In this study, we used directed mutations to show that all six blades of the HCF-1 beta-propeller contribute to VP16-induced complex assembly, association with LZIP, and cell cycle progression. Although LZIP and VP16 share a common tetrapeptide HCF-binding motif, our results reveal profound differences in their interaction with HCF-1. Importantly, with several of the mutants we observe a poor correlation between the ability to associate with LZIP and promote cell proliferation in the context of the full HCF-1 amino terminus, arguing that the HCF-1 beta-propeller domain must target other cellular transcription factors in order to contribute to G(1) progression.

15805117|t|Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) may function as a double homotrimer complex in the mammalian cell.
15805117|t|The diverse function of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) may be regulated by interactions with different protein partners. Interestingly, the binding sites for all known PCNA-associating proteins are on the outer surface or the C termini ("front") sides of the PCNA trimer. Using cell extracts and purified human PCNA protein, we show here that two PCNA homotrimers form a back-to-back doublet. Mutation analysis suggests that the Arg-5 and Lys-110 residues on the PCNA back side are the contact points of the two homotrimers in the doublet. Furthermore, short synthetic peptides encompassing either Arg-5 or Lys-110 inhibit double trimer formation. We also found that a PCNA double trimer, but not a homotrimer alone, can simultaneously accommodate chromatin assembly factor-1 and polymerase delta. Together, our data supports a model that chromatin remodeling by chromatin assembly factor-1 (and, possibly, many other cellular activities) are tightly coupled with DNA replication (and repair) through a PCNA double trimer complex.

17644582|t|Structure-function analysis of the C-terminal domain of LcrV from Yersinia pestis.
17644582|t|LcrV, a multifunctional protein, acts as a positive regulator of effector protein secretion for the type III secretion system (T3SS) in Yersinia pestis by interaction with the negative regulator LcrG. In this study, LcrV was analyzed to identify regions required for LcrG interaction. Random-linker insertion mutagenesis, deletion analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis of hydrophobic amino acids between residues 290 and 311 allowed the isolation of an LcrV mutant (LcrV L291R F308R) defective for LcrG interaction. The new residues identified in LcrG interaction lie in helix 12 of LcrV; residues in helix 7 of LcrV are known to be involved in LcrG interaction. Helix 7 and helix 12 of LcrV interact to form an intramolecular coiled coil; these new results suggest that the intramolecular coiled coil in LcrV is required for LcrG interaction and activation of the T3SS.

15632183|t|A unique sequence motif in the 54-kDa subunit of the chloroplast signal recognition particle mediates binding to the 43-kDa subunit.
15632183|t|Chloroplasts contain a novel type of signal recognition particle (cpSRP) that consists of two proteins, cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. cpSRP is involved in the post-translational targeting of the nuclear encoded light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins (LHCPs) to the thylakoid membrane by forming a soluble cpSRP.LHCP transit complex in the stroma. Despite high sequence homology between chloroplast and cytosolic SRP54 proteins, the 54-kDa subunit of cpSRP is unique in its ability to bind cpSRP43. In this report, we identified a 10-amino acid long segment of cpSRP54 that forms the cpSRP43-binding site. This segment is located at position 530-539 close to the C terminus of cpSRP54. In addition, we demonstrate that arginine at position 537 is essential for binding cpSRP43 and that mutation of arginine 536 drastically reduced cpSRP43 binding. Mutations within the cpSRP43-binding site of cpSRP54 that reduced or completely abolished cpSRP complex formation also did inhibit transit complex formation and integration of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane, reflecting the importance of these residues for LHCP targeting. Alignment studies revealed that the cpSRP43-binding site is conserved in chloroplast SRP54 proteins and is not present in any SRP54 subunit of cytosolic SRPs.

14504388|t|A novel domain in the protein kinase SOS2 mediates interaction with the protein phosphatase 2C ABI2.
14504388|t|SOS2 (salt overly sensitive 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase required for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we identified the protein phosphatase 2C ABI2 (abscisic acid-insensitive 2) as a SOS2-interacting protein. Deletion analysis led to the discovery of a novel protein domain of 37 amino acid residues, designated as the protein phosphatase interaction (PPI) motif, of SOS2 that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with ABI2. The PPI motif is conserved in protein kinases of the SOS2 family (i.e., protein kinase S, PKS) and in the DNA damage repair and replication block checkpoint kinase, Chk1, from various organisms including humans. Mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the PPI motif abolish the interaction of SOS2 with ABI2. We also identified a protein kinase interaction domain in ABI2 and examined the interaction specificity between PKS and the ABI phosphatases. We found that some PKSs interact strongly with ABI2 whereas others interact preferentially with ABI1. The interaction between SOS2 and ABI2 was disrupted by the abi2-1 mutation, which causes increased tolerance to salt shock and abscisic acid insensitivity in plants. Our results establish the PPI motif and the protein kinase interaction domain as novel protein interaction domains that mediate the binding between the SOS2 family of protein kinases and the ABI1/2 family of protein phosphatases.

19878303|t|Deletion of Phe508 in the first nucleotide-binding domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator increases its affinity for the heat shock cognate 70 chaperone.
19878303|t|The primary cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), the most frequent fatal genetic disease in Caucasians, is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), located in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. F508del-CFTR is recognized by the endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC), which targets it for proteasomal degradation, preventing this misfolded but partially functional Cl(-) channel from reaching the cell membrane. We recently proposed that the ERQC proceeds along several checkpoints, the first of which, utilizing the chaperone heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), is the major one directing F508del-CFTR for proteolysis. Therefore, a detailed characterization of the interaction occurring between F508del-CFTR and Hsc70 is critical to clarify the mechanism that senses misfolded F508del-CFTR in vivo. Here, we determined by surface plasmon resonance that: (a) F508del-murine (m)NBD1 binds Hsc70 with higher affinity (K(D), 2.6 nm) than wild-type (wt) mNBD1 (13.9 nm); (b) ATP and ADP dramatically reduce NBD1-Hsc70 binding; (c) the F508del mutation increases by approximately six-fold the ATP concentration required to inhibit the NBD1-Hsc70 interaction (IC(50); wt-mNBD1, 19.7 microm ATP); and (d) the small molecule CFTR corrector 4a (C4a), but not VRT-325 (V325; both rescuing F508del-CFTR traffic), significantly reduces F508del-mNBD1 binding to Hsc70, by approximately 30%. Altogether, these results provide a novel, robust quantitative characterization of Hsc70-NBD1 binding, bringing detailed insights into the molecular basis of CF. Moreover, we show how this surface plasmon resonance assay helps to elucidate the mechanism of action of small corrective molecules, demonstrating its potential to validate additional therapeutic compounds for CF.

16834334|t|Andersen's syndrome mutation effects on the structure and assembly of the cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1.
16834334|t|Kir2.1 channels play a key role in maintaining the correct resting potential in eukaryotic cells. Recently, specific amino acid mutations in the Kir2.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channel have been found to cause Andersen's Syndrome in humans. Here, we have characterized individual Andersen's Syndrome mutants R218Q, G300V, E303K, and delta314-315 and have found multiple effects on the ability of the cytoplasmic domains in Kir2.1 channels to form proper tetrameric assemblies. For the R218Q mutation, we identified a second site mutation (T309K) that restored tetrameric assembly but not function. We successfully crystallized and solved the structure (at 2.0 A) of the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1-R218Q/T309K(S). This new structure revealed multiple conformations of the G-loop and CD loop, providing an explanation for channels that assemble but do not conduct ions. Interestingly, Glu303 forms both intra- and intersubunit salt bridges, depending on the conformation of the G-loop, suggesting that the E303K mutant stabilizes both closed and open G-loop conformations. In the Kir2.1-R218Q/T309K(S) structure, we discovered that the DE loop forms a hydrophobic pocket that binds 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, which is located near the putative G(betagamma)-activation site of Kir3 channels. Finally, we observed a potassium ion bound to the cytoplasmic domain for this class of K+ channels.

12813041|t|A negatively charged amino acid in Skp2 is required for Skp2-Cks1 interaction and ubiquitination of p27Kip1.
12813041|t|Proteolysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 occurs predominantly in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle through a ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. Ubiquitination of p27 requires the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and Skp2 F-box binding protein Cks1. The mechanisms by which Skp2 recognizes Cks1 to ubiquitylate p27 remain obscure. Here we show that Asp-331 in the carboxyl terminus of Skp2 is required for its association with Cks1 and ubiquitination of p27. Mutation of Asp-331 to Ala disrupts the interaction between Skp2 and Cks1. Although Asp-331 mutation negates the ability of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) complex to ubiquitylate p27, such a mutation has no effect on Skp2 self-ubiquitination. A conservative change from Asp to Glu at position 331 of Skp2 does not affect Skp2-Cks1 interaction. Our results revealed a unique requirement for a negatively charged residue in the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 in recognition of Cks1 and ubiquitination of p27.

20553494|t|An autoinhibitory effect of the homothorax domain of Meis2.
20553494|t|Myeloid ecotropic insertion site (Meis)2 is a homeodomain protein containing a conserved homothorax (Hth) domain that is present in all Meis and Prep family proteins and in the Drosophila Hth protein. The Hth domain mediates interaction with Pbx homeodomain proteins, allowing for efficient DNA binding. Here we show that, like Meis1, Meis2 has a strong C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, which is required for full activation of transcription by homeodomain protein complexes composed of Meis2 and Pbx1. We also show that the activity of the activation domain is inhibited by the Hth domain, and that this autoinhibition can be partially relieved by the interaction of Pbx1 with the Hth domain of Meis2. Targeting of the Hth domain to DNA suggests that it is not a portable trans-acting repression domain. However, the Hth domain can inhibit a linked activation domain, and this inhibition is not limited to the Meis2 activation domain. Database searching reveals that the Meis3.2 splice variant, which is found in several vertebrate species, disrupts the Hth domain by removing 17 codons from the 5'-end of exon 6. We show that the equivalent deletion in Meis2 derepresses the C-terminal activation domain and weakens interaction with Pbx1. This work suggests that the transcriptional activity of all members of the Meis/Prep Hth protein family is subject to autoinhibition by their Hth domains, and that the Meis3.2 splice variant encodes a protein that bypasses this autoinhibitory effect.

18165306|t|Analysis of YfgL and YaeT interactions through bioinformatics, mutagenesis, and biochemistry.
18165306|t|In Escherichia coli, YaeT, together with four lipoproteins, YfgL, YfiO, NlpB, and SmpA, forms a complex that is essential for beta-barrel outer membrane protein biogenesis. Data suggest that YfgL and YfiO make direct but independent physical contacts with YaeT. Whereas the YaeT-YfiO interaction needs NlpB and SmpA for complex stabilization, the YaeT-YfgL interaction does not. Using bioinformatics, genetics, and biochemical approaches, we have identified three residues, L173, L175, and R176, in the mature YfgL protein that are critical for both function and interactions with YaeT. A single substitution at any of these sites produces no phenotypic defect, but two or three simultaneous alterations produce mild or yfgL-null phenotypes, respectively. Interestingly, biochemical data show that all YfgL variants, including those with single substitutions, have weakened in vivo YaeT-YfgL interaction. These defects are not due to mislocalization or low steady-state levels of YfgL. Cysteine-directed cross-linking data show that the region encompassing L173, L175, and R176 makes direct contact with YaeT. Using the same genetic and biochemical strategies, it was found that altering residues D227 and D229 in another region of YfgL from E221 to D229 resulted in defective YaeT bindings. In contrast, mutational analysis of conserved residues V319 to H328 of YfgL shows that they are important for YfgL biogenesis but not YfgL-YaeT interactions. The five YfgL mutants defective in YaeT associations and the yfgL background were used to show that SurA binds to YaeT (or another complex member) without going through YfgL.

10814541|t|A possible interaction of thioredoxin with VDUP1 in HeLa cells detected in a yeast two-hybrid system.
10814541|t|Human thioredoxin (hTrx), a small ubiquitous protein with strong reducing potential, has multiple biological functions, including signal transduction and regulation of the activity of transcription factors. hTrx expression is enhanced in HPV-transformed cancer cells; however, the role of hTrx in the malignant cells is not fully understood. We employed a yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that bind to hTrx in HeLa cells, a type of HPV-transformed human cervical cancer cell. In a screen of 1.62 x 10(6) yeast cotransformed with a HeLa cDNA library and an hTrx vector, 13 clones were identified as candidates for hTrx-binding proteins. Among them, 3 clones were found to code in frame for the carboxyl-terminal portion of VDUP1 protein, lacking at most the first 155 residues from the start codon. A reconstructed clone carrying the full-length VDUP1 coding sequence also showed the ability to bind to an hTrx fusion protein. Loss of interaction between VDUP1 and hTrx was observed either when two cysteines (Cys 32 and 35) in hTrx were substituted by serines or when the deletion in VDUP1 was extended from amino acid position 155 to 225 or beyond. The 71-mer peptide fragment (position 155-225) of VDUP-1 alone did not bind to hTrx.

16127465|t|Activating and deactivating mutations in the receptor interaction site of GDF5 cause symphalangism or brachydactyly type A2.
16127465|t|Here we describe 2 mutations in growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) that alter receptor-binding affinities. They cause brachydactyly type A2 (L441P) and symphalangism (R438L), conditions previously associated with mutations in the GDF5 receptor bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1b (BMPR1B) and the BMP antagonist NOGGIN, respectively. We expressed the mutant proteins in limb bud micromass culture and treated ATDC5 and C2C12 cells with recombinant GDF5. Our results indicated that the L441P mutant is almost inactive. The R438L mutant, in contrast, showed increased biological activity when compared with WT GDF5. Biosensor interaction analyses revealed loss of binding to BMPR1A and BMPR1B ectodomains for the L441P mutant, whereas the R438L mutant showed normal binding to BMPR1B but increased binding to BMPR1A, the receptor normally activated by BMP2. The binding to NOGGIN was normal for both mutants. Thus, the brachydactyly type A2 phenotype (L441P) is caused by inhibition of the ligand-receptor interaction, whereas the symphalangism phenotype (R438L) is caused by a loss of receptor-binding specificity, resulting in a gain of function by the acquisition of BMP2-like properties. The presented experiments have identified some of the main determinants of GDF5 receptor-binding specificity in vivo and open new prospects for generating antagonists and superagonists of GDF5.

21239585|t|Effects of metal on the biochemical properties of Helicobacter pylori HypB, a maturation factor of [NiFe]-hydrogenase and urease.
21239585|t|The biosyntheses of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase and urease enzymes in Helicobacter pylori require several accessory proteins for proper construction of the nickel-containing metallocenters. The hydrogenase accessory proteins HypA and HypB, a GTPase, have been implicated in the nickel delivery steps of both enzymes. In this study, the metal-binding properties of H. pylori HypB were characterized, and the effects of metal binding on the biochemical behavior of the protein were examined. The protein can bind stoichiometric amounts of Zn(II) or Ni(II), each with nanomolar affinity. Mutation of Cys106 and His107, which are located between two major GTPase motifs, results in undetectable Ni(II) binding, and the Zn(II) affinity is weakened by 2 orders of magnitude. These two residues are also required for the metal-dependent dimerization observed in the presence of Ni(II) but not Zn(II). The addition of metals to the protein has distinct impacts on GTPase activity, with zinc significantly reducing GTP hydrolysis to below detectable levels and nickel only slightly altering the k(cat) and K(m) of the reaction. The regulation of HypB activities by metal binding may contribute to the maturation of the nickel-containing enzymes.

15247908|t|PH domain of ELMO functions in trans to regulate Rac activation via Dock180.
15247908|t|The members of the Dock180 superfamily of proteins are novel guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) for Rho family GTPases and are linked to multiple biological processes from worms to mammals. ELMO is a critical regulator of Dock180, and the Dock180-ELMO complex functions as a bipartite GEF for Rac. We identified a mechanism wherein the PH domain of ELMO, by binding the Dock180-Rac complex in trans, stabilizes Rac in the nucleotide-free transition state. Mutagenesis studies reveal that this ELMO PH domain-dependent regulation is essential for the Dock180-ELMO complex to function in phagocytosis and cell migration. Genetic rescue studies in Caenorhabditis elegans using ELMO and its homolog CED-12 support the above observations in vivo. These data reveal a new mode of action of PH domains and a novel, evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which a bipartite GEF can activate Rac.

24835508|t|Activity of the upstream TATA-less promoter of the p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene depends on transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) in addition to TFIIA-reactive TBP-like protein.
24835508|t|TATA-binding protein-like protein (TLP) binds to transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) with high affinity, although the significance of this binding is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of TFIIA in transcriptional regulation of the p21(Waf1/Cip1) (p21) gene. It has been shown that TLP is indispensable for p53-activated transcription from an upstream TATA-less promoter of the p21 gene. We found that mutant TLPs having decreased TFIIA-binding ability exhibited weakened transcriptional activation function for the upstream promoter. Activity of the upstream promoter was enhanced considerably by an increased amount of TFIIA in a p53-dependent manner, whereas activity of the TATA-containing downstream promoter was enhanced only slightly. TFIIA potentiated the upstream promoter additively with TLP. Although TFIIA is recruited to both promoters, activity of the upstream promoter was much more dependent on TFIIA. Recruitment of TFIIA and TLP to the upstream promoter was augmented in etoposide-treated cells, in which the amount of TFIIA-TLP complex is increased, and TFIIA-reactive TLP was required for the recruitment of both factors. It was confirmed that etoposide-stimulated transcription depends on TLP. We also found that TFIIA-reactive TLP acts to decrease cell growth rate, which can be explained by interaction of the p21 promoter with the transcription factors that we examined. The results of the present study suggest that the upstream TATA-less promoter of p21 needs TFIIA and TFIIA-reactive TLP for p53-dependent transcriptional enhancement.

22978324|t|Phosphorylation on threonine 11 of b-dystrobrevin alters its interaction with kinesin heavy chain.
22978324|t|Dystrobrevin family members (a and b) are cytoplasmic components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, a multimeric protein complex first isolated from skeletal muscle, which links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. Dystrobrevin shares high homology with the cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains of dystrophin and a common domain organization. The b-dystrobrevin isoform is restricted to nonmuscle tissues, serves as a scaffold for signaling complexes, and may participate in intracellular transport through its interaction with kinesin heavy chain. We have previously characterized the molecular determinants affecting the b-dystrobrevin-kinesin heavy chain interaction, among which is cAMP-dependent protein kinase [protein kinase A (PKA)] phosphorylation of b-dystrobrevin. In this study, we have identified b-dystrobrevin residues phosphorylated in vitro by PKA with pull-down assays, surface plasmon resonance measurements, and MS analysis. Among the identified phosphorylated residues, we demonstrated, by site-directed mutagenesis, that Thr11 is the regulatory site for the b-dystrobrevin-kinesin interaction. As dystrobrevin may function as a signaling scaffold for kinases/phosphatases, we also investigated whether b-dystrobrevin is phosphorylated in vitro by kinases other than PKA. Thr11 was phosphorylated by protein kinase C, suggesting that this represents a key residue modified by the activation of different signaling pathways.

23871208|t|The autoimmunity-associated gene PTPN22 potentiates toll-like receptor-driven, type 1 interferon-dependent immunity.
23871208|t|Immune cells sense microbial products through Toll-like receptors (TLR), which trigger host defense responses including type 1 interferons (IFNs) secretion. A coding polymorphism in the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene is a susceptibility allele for human autoimmune and infectious disease. We report that Ptpn22 selectively regulated type 1 IFN production after TLR engagement in myeloid cells. Ptpn22 promoted host antiviral responses and was critical for TLR agonist-induced, type 1 IFN-dependent suppression of inflammation in colitis and arthritis. PTPN22 directly associated with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and promotes TRAF3 lysine 63-linked ubiquitination. The disease-associated PTPN22W variant failed to promote TRAF3 ubiquitination, type 1 IFN upregulation, and type 1 IFN-dependent suppression of arthritis. The findings establish a candidate innate immune mechanism of action for a human autoimmunity "risk" gene in the regulation of host defense and inflammation.

22579287|t|Oncogenic mutations counteract intrinsic disorder in the EGFR kinase and promote receptor dimerization.
22579287|t|The mutation and overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with the development of a variety of cancers, making this prototypical dimerization-activated receptor tyrosine kinase a prominent target of cancer drugs. Using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the N lobe dimerization interface of the wild-type EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically disordered and that it becomes ordered only upon dimerization. Our simulations suggest, moreover, that some cancer-linked mutations distal to the dimerization interface, particularly the widespread L834R mutation (also referred to as L858R), facilitate EGFR dimerization by suppressing this local disorder. Corroborating these findings, our biophysical experiments and kinase enzymatic assays indicate that the L834R mutation causes abnormally high activity primarily by promoting EGFR dimerization rather than by allowing activation without dimerization. We also find that phosphorylation of EGFR kinase domain at Tyr845 may suppress the intrinsic disorder, suggesting a molecular mechanism for autonomous EGFR signaling.

17218263|t|Structural basis of integrin activation by talin.
17218263|t|Regulation of integrin affinity (activation) is essential for metazoan development and for many pathological processes. Binding of the talin phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic domains (tails) causes activation, whereas numerous other PTB-domain-containing proteins bind integrins without activating them. Here we define the structure of a complex between talin and the membrane-proximal integrin beta3 cytoplasmic domain and identify specific contacts between talin and the integrin tail required for activation. We used structure-based mutagenesis to engineer talin and beta3 variants that interact with comparable affinity to the wild-type proteins but inhibit integrin activation by competing with endogenous talin. These results reveal the structural basis of talin's unique ability to activate integrins, identify an interaction that could aid in the design of therapeutics to block integrin activation, and enable engineering of cells with defects in the activation of multiple classes of integrins.

11112409|t|Interaction of Daxx, a Fas binding protein, with sentrin and Ubc9.
11112409|t|Sentrin is a ubiquitin-like protein that can covalently modify cellular proteins, and is a Fas binding protein that protects cells against anti-Fas induced cell death. However, the mechanism by which sentrin exerts its effect upon Fas-mediated apoptosis is not well known. Thus, this study examined the interaction of sentrin with Daxx. Sentrin interacted with Daxx but not with FADD when analyzed by yeast two-hybrid assay. In vitro translated Daxx bound to GST-sentrin fusion protein. FLAG-sentrin fusion protein was also coimmunoprecipitated with Daxx in BOSC23 cells. Also, Daxx interacted with Ubc9, an essential protein as a key conjugating enzyme. Amino acids 625-740 of Daxx, known as Fas binding region, was also mapped as sentrin and Ubc9 binding region. Colocalization of Fas, sentrin, and Ubc9 binding regions suggests the importance of that region upon the regulation of Daxx. Our data also demonstrated that sentrin could homooligomerize by protein-protein interaction.

16830178|t|ARL1 plays a role in the binding of the GRIP domain of a peripheral matrix protein to the Golgi apparatus in plant cells.
16830178|t|ARF GTPases play a central role in regulating membrane dynamics and protein transport in eukaryotic cells. ARF-like (ARL) proteins are close relatives of the ARF regulators of vesicular transport, but their function in plant cells is poorly characterized. Here, by means of live cell imaging and site-directed mutagenesis, we have investigated the cellular function of the plant GTPase ARL1. We provide direct evidence for a role of this ARL family member in the association of a plant golgin with the plant Golgi apparatus. Our data reveal the existence of key residues within the conserved GRIP-domain of the golgin and within the GTPase ARL1 that are central to ARL1-GRIP interaction. Mutations of these residues abolish the interaction of GRIP with the GTP-bound ARL1 and induce a redistribution of GRIP into the cytosol. This indicates that the localization of GRIP to the Golgi apparatus is strongly influenced by the interaction of GRIP with Golgi-localized ARL1. Our results assign a cellular role to a member of the Arabidopsis ARL family in the plant secretory pathway and propose mechanisms for localization of peripheral golgins to the plant Golgi apparatus.

16096643|t|14-3-3eta is a novel regulator of parkin ubiquitin ligase.
16096643|t|Mutation of the parkin gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, is the major cause of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). Although various substrates for parkin have been identified, the mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of parkin are poorly understood. Here we report that 14-3-3eta, a chaperone-like protein present abundantly in neurons, could bind to parkin and negatively regulate its ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, 14-3-3eta could bind to the linker region of parkin but not parkin with ARJP-causing R42P, K161N, and T240R mutations. Intriguingly, alpha-synuclein (alpha-SN), another familial Parkinson's disease (PD) gene product, abrogated the 14-3-3eta-induced suppression of parkin activity. alpha-SN could bind tightly to 14-3-3eta and consequently sequester it from the parkin-14-3-3eta complex. PD-causing A30P and A53T mutants of alpha-SN could not bind 14-3-3eta, and failed to activate parkin. Our findings indicate that 14-3-3eta is a regulator that functionally links parkin and alpha-SN. The alpha-SN-positive and 14-3-3eta-negative control of parkin activity sheds new light on the pathophysiological roles of parkin.

12588987|t|Beta-catenin binds to the activation function 2 region of the androgen receptor and modulates the effects of the N-terminal domain and TIF2 on ligand-dependent transcription.
12588987|t|Beta-catenin is a multifunctional molecule that is activated by signaling through WNT receptors. beta-Catenin can also enhance the transcriptional activity of some steroid hormone receptors such as the androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor alpha. Androgens can affect nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and influence its subcellular distribution. Using mammalian two-hybrid binding assays, analysis of reporter gene transcription, and coimmunoprecipitation, we now show that beta-catenin binds to the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD) and modulates the transcriptional effects of TIF2 and the androgen receptor N-terminal domain (NTD). In functional assays, beta-catenin bound to androgen receptor only in the presence of ligand agonists, not antagonists. Beta-catenin binding to the androgen receptor LBD was independent of and cooperative with the androgen receptor NTD and the p160 coactivator TIF2, both of which bind to the activation function 2 (AF-2) region of the androgen receptor. Different mutations of androgen receptor helix 3 amino acids disrupted binding of androgen receptor NTD and beta-catenin. beta-Catenin, androgen receptor NTD, and TIF2 binding to the androgen receptor LBD were affected similarly by a subset of helix 12 mutations, but disruption of two sites on helix 12 affected only binding of beta-catenin and not of TIF2 or the androgen receptor NTD. Mutational disruption of each of five LXXLL peptide motifs in the beta-catenin armadillo repeats did not disrupt either binding to androgen receptor or transcriptional coactivation. ICAT, an inhibitor of T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4), and E-cadherin binding to beta-catenin also blocked binding of the androgen receptor LBD. We also demonstrated cross talk between the WNT and androgen receptor signaling pathways because excess androgen receptor could interfere with WNT signaling and excess TCF-4 inhibited the interaction of beta-catenin and androgen receptor. Taken together, the data show that beta-catenin can bind to the androgen receptor LBD and modulate the effects of the androgen receptor NTD and TIF2 on transcription.

11027267|t|Using a two-hybrid screening with TOM1, a putative ubiquitin-ligase gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated KRR1, a homologue of human HRB2 (for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev-binding protein 2). To characterize the gene function, we constructed temperature-sensitive krr1 mutants and isolated two multicopy suppressors. One suppressor is RPS14A, encoding a 40S ribosomal protein. The C-terminal-truncated rpS14p, which was reported to have diminished binding activity to 18S rRNA, failed to suppress the krr1 mutant. The other suppressor is a novel gene, KRI1 (for KRR1 interacting protein; YNL308c). KRI1 is essential for viability, and Kri1p is localized to the nucleolus. We constructed a galactose-dependent kri1 strain by placing KRI1 under control of the GAL1 promoter, so that expression of KRI1 was shut off when transferring the culture to glucose medium. Polysome and 40S ribosome fractions were severely decreased in the krr1 mutant and Kri1p-depleted cells. Pulse-chase analysis of newly synthesized rRNAs demonstrated that 18S rRNA is not produced in either mutant. However, wild-type levels of 25S rRNA are made in either mutant. Northern analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of 18S rRNA and 20S pre-rRNAs were reduced in both mutants. Precursors for 18S rRNA were detected but probably very unstable in both mutants. A myc-tagged Kri1p coimmunoprecipitated with a hemagglutinin-tagged Krr1p. Furthermore, the krr1 mutant protein was defective in its interaction with Kri1p. These data lead us to conclude that Krr1p physically and functionally interacts with Kri1p to form a complex which is required for 40S ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.

15572661|t|Negative modulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity by Daxx.
15572661|t|The transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) modulated by positive or negative regulators plays a critical role in controlling the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. Although numerous positive regulators have been identified, negative regulators of AR are less well understood. We report here that Daxx functions as a negative AR coregulator through direct protein-protein interactions. Overexpression of Daxx suppressed AR-mediated promoter activity in COS-1 and LNCaP cells and AR-mediated prostate-specific antigen expression in LNCaP cells. Conversely, downregulation of endogenous Daxx expression by RNA interference enhances androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen expression in LNCaP cells. In vitro and in vivo interaction studies revealed that Daxx binds to both the amino-terminal and the DNA-binding domain of the AR. Daxx proteins interfere with the AR DNA-binding activity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, sumoylation of AR at its amino-terminal domain is involved in Daxx interaction and trans-repression. Together, these findings not only provide a novel role of Daxx in controlling AR transactivation activity but also uncover the mechanism underlying sumoylation-dependent transcriptional repression of the AR.

17947231|t|Spontaneous assembly of photosynthetic supramolecular complexes as mediated by the intrinsically unstructured protein CP12.
17947231|t|CP12 is a protein of 8.7 kDa that contributes to Calvin cycle regulation by acting as a scaffold element in the formation of a supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) in photosynthetic organisms. NMR studies of recombinant CP12 (isoform 2) of Arabidopsis thaliana show that CP12-2 is poorly structured. CP12-2 is monomeric in solution and contains four cysteines, which can form two intramolecular disulfides with midpoint redox potentials of -326 and -352 mV, respectively, at pH 7.9. Site-specific mutants indicate that the C-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between CP12-2 and GAPDH (isoform A(4)), whereas the N-terminal disulfide is involved in the interaction between this binary complex and PRK. In the presence of NAD, oxidized CP12-2 interacts with A(4)-GAPDH (K(D) = 0.18 microm) to form a binary complex of 170 kDa with (A(4)-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)(2) stoichiometry, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and multiangle light scattering analysis. PRK is a dimer and by interacting with this binary complex (K(D) = 0.17 microm) leads to a 498-kDa ternary complex constituted by two binary complexes and two PRK dimers, i.e. ((A(4)-GAPDH)-(CP12-2)(2)-(PRK))(2). Thermodynamic parameters indicate that assembly of both binary and ternary complexes is exoergonic although penalized by a decrease in entropy that suggests an induced folding of CP12-2 upon binding to partner proteins. The redox dependence of events leading to supramolecular complexes is consistent with a role of CP12 in coordinating the reversible inactivation of chloroplast enzymes A(4)-GAPDH and PRK during darkness in photosynthetic tissues.

16299177|t|Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinase AtCPK32 interacts with ABF4, a transcriptional regulator of abscisic acid-responsive gene expression, and modulates its activity.
16299177|t|The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates stress-responsive gene expression during vegetative growth. The ABA regulation of many genes is mediated by a subfamily of basic leucine zipper class transcription factors referred to as ABFs (i.e. ABF1-ABF4), whose transcriptional activity is induced by ABA. Here we show that a calcium-dependent protein kinase is involved in the ABA-dependent activation process. We carried out yeast two-hybrid screens to identify regulatory components of ABF4 function and isolated AtCPK32 as an ABF4-interacting protein. AtCPK32 has autophosphorylation activity and can phosphorylate ABF4 in vitro. Mutational analysis indicated that serine-110 of ABF4, which is highly conserved among ABF family members, may be phosphorylated by AtCPK32. The serine-110 residue is essential for ABF4-AtCPK32 interaction, and transient expression assay revealed that it is also required for the normal transcriptional function of ABF4. The expression patterns and subcellular localization of AtCPK32 are similar to those of ABF4. Furthermore, its overexpression affects both ABA sensitivity and the expression of a number of ABF4-regulated genes. Together, our data demonstrate that AtCPK32 is an ABA signaling component that regulates the ABA-responsive gene expression via ABF4.

21471202|t|Bone overgrowth-associated mutations in the LRP4 gene impair sclerostin facilitator function.
21471202|t|Humans lacking sclerostin display progressive bone overgrowth due to increased bone formation. Although it is well established that sclerostin is an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We identified in tandem affinity purification proteomics screens LRP4 (low density lipoprotein-related protein 4) as a sclerostin interaction partner. Biochemical assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that sclerostin LRP4 interaction is direct. Interestingly, in vitro overexpression and RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that LRP4 specifically facilitates the previously described inhibitory action of sclerostin on Wnt1/b-catenin signaling. We found the extracellular b-propeller structured domain of LRP4 to be required for this sclerostin facilitator activity. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that LRP4 protein is present in human and rodent osteoblasts and osteocytes, both presumed target cells of sclerostin action. Silencing of LRP4 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery blocked sclerostin inhibitory action on in vitro bone mineralization. Notably, we identified two mutations in LRP4 (R1170W and W1186S) in patients suffering from bone overgrowth. We found that these mutations impair LRP4 interaction with sclerostin and its concomitant sclerostin facilitator effect. Together these data indicate that the interaction of sclerostin with LRP4 is required to mediate the inhibitory function of sclerostin on bone formation, thus identifying a novel role for LRP4 in bone.

18715871|t|PP4R4/KIAA1622 forms a novel stable cytosolic complex with phosphoprotein phosphatase 4.
18715871|t|Protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4 (PP4c) is an essential polypeptide involved in critical cellular processes such as microtubule growth and organization, DNA damage checkpoint recovery, apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor alpha signaling. Like other phosphatases of the PP2A family, PP4c interacts with regulatory proteins, which specify substrate targeting and intracellular localization. The identification of these regulatory proteins is, therefore, key to fully understanding the function of this enzyme class. Here, using a sensitive affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach, we identify a novel, stable cytosolic PP4c interacting partner, KIAA1622, which we have renamed PP4R4. PP4R4 displays weak sequence homology with the A (scaffolding) subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme and specifically associates with PP4c (and not with the related PP2Ac or PP6c phosphatases). The PP4c.PP4R4 interaction is disrupted by mutations analogous to those abrogating the association of PP2Ac with PP2A A subunit. However, unlike the PP2A A subunit, which plays a scaffolding role, PP4R4 does not bridge PP4c with previously characterized PP4 regulatory subunits. PP4c.PP4R4 complexes exhibit phosphatase activity toward a fluorogenic substrate and gammaH2AX, but this activity is lower than that associated with the PP4c.PP4R2.PP4R3 complex, which itself is less active than the free PP4c catalytic subunit. Our data demonstrate that PP4R4 forms a novel cytosolic complex with PP4c, independent from the complexes containing PP4R1, PP4R2.PP4R3, and alpha4, and that the regulatory subunits of PP4c have evolved different modes of interaction with the catalytic subunit.

22303461|t|LRRK2 phosphorylates tubulin-associated tau but not the free molecule: LRRK2-mediated regulation of the tau-tubulin association and neurite outgrowth.
22303461|t|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a large protein kinase containing multi-functional domains, has been identified as the causal molecule for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that (i) LRRK2 interacts with tau in a tubulin-dependent manner; (ii) LRRK2 directly phosphorylates tubulin-associated tau, but not free tau; (iii) LRRK2 phosphorylates tau at Thr181 as one of the target sites; and (iv) The PD-associated LRRK2 mutations, G2019S and I2020T, elevated the degree of tau-phosphorylation. These results provide direct proof that tau is a physiological substrate for LRRK2. Furthermore, we revealed that LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tau reduces its tubulin-binding ability. Our results suggest that LRRK2 plays an important role as a physiological regulator for phosphorylation-mediated dissociation of tau from microtubules, which is an integral aspect of microtubule dynamics essential for neurite outgrowth and axonal transport.

10837255|t|Complex formation between Mad1p, Bub1p and Bub3p is crucial for spindle checkpoint function.
10837255|t|The spindle checkpoint delays the metaphase to anaphase transition in response to defects in kinetochore-microtubule interactions in the mitotic apparatus (see [1] [2] [3] [4] for reviews). The Mad and Bub proteins were identified as key components of the spindle checkpoint through budding yeast genetics [5] [6] and are highly conserved [3]. Most of the spindle checkpoint proteins have been localised to kinetochores, yet almost nothing is known about the molecular events which take place there. Mad1p forms a tight complex with Mad2p [7], and has been shown to recruit Mad2p to kinetochores [8]. Similarly, Bub3p binds to Bub1p [9] and may target it to kinetochores [10]. Here, we show that budding yeast Mad1p has a regulated association with Bub1p and Bub3p during a normal cell cycle and that this complex is found at significantly higher levels once the spindle checkpoint is activated. We find that formation of this complex requires Mad2p and Mps1p but not Mad3p or Bub2p. In addition, we identify a conserved motif within Mad1p that is essential for Mad1p-Bub1p-Bub3p complex formation. Mutation of this motif abolishes checkpoint function, indicating that formation of the Mad1p-Bub1p-Bub3p complex is a crucial step in the spindle checkpoint mechanism.

9528852|t|We have identified a novel protein, BAP1, which binds to the RING finger domain of the Breast/Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility Gene product, BRCA1. BAP1 is a nuclear-localized, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, suggesting that deubiquitinating enzymes may play a role in BRCA1 function. BAP1 binds to the wild-type BRCA1-RING finger, but not to germline mutants of the BRCA1-RING finger found in breast cancer kindreds. BAP1 and BRCA1 are temporally and spatially co-expressed during murine breast development and remodeling, and show overlapping patterns of subnuclear distribution. BAP1 resides on human chromosome 3p21.3; intragenic homozygous rearrangements and deletions of BAP1 have been found in lung carcinoma cell lines. BAP1 enhances BRCA1-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and is the first nuclear-localized ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase to be identified. BAP1 may be a new tumor suppressor gene which functions in the BRCA1 growth control pathway.

19162005|t|Response gene to complement 32 is required for C5b-9 induced cell cycle activation in endothelial cells.
19162005|t|Proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) is a critical event in angiogenesis and atherosclerosis. We previously showed that the C5b-9 assembly during complement activation induces cell cycle in human aortic EC (AEC) and SMC. C5b-9 can induce the expression of Response Gene to Complement (RGC)-32 and over expression of this gene leads to cell cycle activation. Therefore, the present study was carried out to test the requirement of endogenous RGC-32 for the cell cycle activation induced by C5b-9 by knocking-down its expression using siRNA. We identified two RGC-32 siRNAs that can markedly reduce the expression of RGC-32 mRNA in AEC. RGC-32 silencing in these cells abolished DNA synthesis induced by C5b-9 and serum growth factors, indicating the requirement of RGC-32 activity for S-phase entry. RGC-32 siRNA knockdown also significantly reduced the C5b-9 induced CDC2 activation and Akt phosphorylation. CDC2 does not play a role in G1/S transition in HeLa cells stably overexpressing RGC-32. RGC-32 was found to physically associate with Akt and was phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. Mutation of RGC-32 protein at Ser 45 and Ser 47 prevented Akt mediated phosphorylation. In addition, RGC-32 was found to regulate the release of growth factors from AEC. All these data together suggest that cell cycle induction by C5b-9 in AEC is RGC-32 dependent and this is in part through regulation of Akt and growth factor release.

12354775|t|Zinc-dependent interaction between dishevelled and the Drosophila Wnt antagonist naked cuticle.
12354775|t|During Drosophila development, the naked cuticle (nkd) gene attenuates wingless/Wnt signaling through a negative feedback loop mechanism. Fly and vertebrate Nkd proteins contain a putative calcium-binding EF-hand motif, the EFX domain, that interacts with the basic/PDZ region of the Wnt signal transducer, dishevelled (Dsh). Here we show that Dsh binding by Drosophila Nkd in vitro is mediated by the EFX domain as well as an adjacent C-terminal sequence. In vivo data suggest that both of these regions contribute to the ability of Nkd to antagonize Wnt signaling. Mutations in the Nkd EF-hand designed to eliminate potential ion binding affected Nkd-Dsh interactions in the yeast two-hybrid assay but not in the glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. Addition of the chelating agent EDTA abolished the in vitro Nkd-Dsh interaction. Surprisingly zinc, but not calcium, was able to restore Nkd-Dsh binding, suggesting a zinc-mediated interaction. Calcium 45- and zinc 65-blotting experiments show that Nkd is a zinc-binding metalloprotein. The results further clarify how Nkd may antagonize Wnt signaling via interaction with Dsh, and identify a novel zinc-binding domain in Drosophila Nkd that collaborates with the conserved EFX domain to bind Dsh.

16002700|t|Mutational analysis of the human 2B4 (CD244)/CD48 interaction: Lys68 and Glu70 in the V domain of 2B4 are critical for CD48 binding and functional activation of NK cells.
16002700|t|Interaction between receptors and ligands plays a critical role in the generation of immune responses. The 2B4 (CD244), a member of the CD2 subset of the Ig superfamily, is the high affinity ligand for CD48. It is expressed on NK cells, T cells, monocytes, and basophils. Recent data indicate that 2B4/CD48 interactions regulate NK and T lymphocyte functions. In human NK cells, 2B4/CD48 interaction induces activation signals, whereas in murine NK cells it sends inhibitory signals. To determine the structural basis for 2B4/CD48 interaction, selected amino acid residues in the V domain of the human 2B4 (h2B4) were mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Following transient expression of these mutants in B16F10 melanoma cells, their interaction with soluble CD48-Fc fusion protein was assessed by flow cytometry. We identified amino acid residues in the extracellular domain of h2B4 that are involved in interacting with CD48. Binding of CD48-Fc fusion protein to RNK-16 cells stably transfected with wild-type and a double-mutant Lys(68)Ala-Glu(70)Ala h2B4 further demonstrated that Lys(68) and Glu(70) in the V domain of h2B4 are essential for 2B4/CD48 interaction. Functional analysis indicated that Lys(68) and Glu(70) in the extracellular domain of h2B4 play a key role in the activation of human NK cells through 2B4/CD48 interaction.

22773792|t|Physical interaction between coat morphogenetic proteins SpoVID and CotE is necessary for spore encasement in Bacillus subtilis.
22773792|t|Endospore formation by Bacillus subtilis is a complex and dynamic process. One of the major challenges of sporulation is the assembly of a protective, multilayered, proteinaceous spore coat, composed of at least 70 different proteins. Spore coat formation can be divided into two distinct stages. The first is the recruitment of proteins to the spore surface, dependent on the morphogenetic protein SpoIVA. The second step, known as encasement, involves the migration of the coat proteins around the circumference of the spore in successive waves, a process dependent on the morphogenetic protein SpoVID and the transcriptional regulation of individual coat genes. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence supporting the hypothesis that SpoVID promotes encasement of the spore by establishing direct protein-protein interactions with other coat morphogenetic proteins. It was previously demonstrated that SpoVID directly interacts with SpoIVA and the inner coat morphogenetic protein, SafA. Here, we show by yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays that SpoVID also interacts directly with the outer coat morphogenetic protein, CotE. Furthermore, by mutational analysis, we identified a specific residue in the N-terminal domain of SpoVID that is essential for the interaction with CotE but dispensable for the interaction with SafA. We propose an updated model of coat assembly and spore encasement that incorporates several physical interactions between the principal coat morphogenetic proteins.

16888629|t|Structure of the Keap1:Nrf2 interface provides mechanistic insight into Nrf2 signaling.
16888629|t|Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein that regulates steady-state levels of Nrf2, a bZIP transcription factor, in response to oxidative stress. We have determined the structure of the Kelch domain of Keap1 bound to a 16-mer peptide from Nrf2 containing a highly conserved DxETGE motif. The Nrf2 peptide contains two short antiparallel beta-strands connected by two overlapping type I beta-turns stabilized by the aspartate and threonine residues. The beta-turn region fits into a binding pocket on the top face of the Kelch domain and the glutamate residues form multiple hydrogen bonds with highly conserved residues in Keap1. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed the role of individual amino acids for binding of Nrf2 to Keap1 and for Keap1-mediated repression of Nrf2-dependent gene expression. Our results provide a detailed picture of how a BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein binds to its cognate substrate and will enable the rational design of novel chemopreventive agents.

12679340|t|Yeast epiarginase regulation, an enzyme-enzyme activity control: identification of residues of ornithine carbamoyltransferase and arginase responsible for enzyme catalytic and regulatory activities.
12679340|t|In the presence of ornithine and arginine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) and arginase form a one-to-one enzyme complex in which the activity of OTCase is inhibited whereas arginase remains catalytically active. The mechanism by which these nonallosteric enzymes form a stable complex triggered by the binding of their respective substrates raises the question of how such a cooperative association is induced. Analyses of mutations in both enzymes identify residues that are required for their association, some of them being important for catalysis. In arginase, two cysteines at the C terminus of the protein are crucial for its epiarginase function but not for its catalytic activity and trimeric structure. In OTCase, mutations of putative ornithine binding residues, Asp-182, Asn-184, Asn-185, Cys-289, and Glu-256 greatly reduced the affinity for ornithine and impaired the interaction with arginase. The four lysine residues located in the SMG loop, Lys-260, Lys-263, Lys-265, and Lys-268, also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of OTCase to ornithine and to arginase and appear to be involved in transducing and enhancing the signal given by ornithine for the closure of the catalytic domain.

21763481|t|Disruption of a ciliary B9 protein complex causes Meckel syndrome.
21763481|t|Nearly every ciliated organism possesses three B9 domain-containing proteins: MKS1, B9D1, and B9D2. Mutations in human MKS1 cause Meckel syndrome (MKS), a severe ciliopathy characterized by occipital encephalocele, liver ductal plate malformations, polydactyly, and kidney cysts. Mouse mutations in either Mks1 or B9d2 compromise ciliogenesis and result in phenotypes similar to those of MKS. Given the importance of these two B9 proteins to ciliogenesis, we examined the role of the third B9 protein, B9d1. Mice lacking B9d1 displayed polydactyly, kidney cysts, ductal plate malformations, and abnormal patterning of the neural tube, concomitant with compromised ciliogenesis, ciliary protein localization, and Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction. These data prompted us to screen MKS patients for mutations in B9D1 and B9D2. We identified a homozygous c.301A>C (p.Ser101Arg) B9D2 mutation that segregates with MKS, affects an evolutionarily conserved residue, and is absent from controls. Unlike wild-type B9D2 mRNA, the p.Ser101Arg mutation failed to rescue zebrafish phenotypes induced by the suppression of b9d2. With coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, we found that Mks1, B9d1, and B9d2 interact physically, but that the p.Ser101Arg mutation abrogates the ability of B9d2 to interact with Mks1, further suggesting that the mutation compromises B9d2 function. Our data indicate that B9d1 is required for normal Hh signaling, ciliogenesis, and ciliary protein localization and that B9d1 and B9d2 are essential components of a B9 protein complex, disruption of which causes MKS.

8702870|t|The Ste20-like protein kinase, Mst1, dimerizes and contains an inhibitory domain.
8702870|t|The human serine/threonine protein kinases, Mst1 and Mst2, share considerable homology to Ste20 and p21-activated kinase (Pak) throughout their catalytic domains. However, outside the catalytic domains there are no significant homologies to previously described Ste20-like kinases or other proteins. To understand the role of the nonhomologous regions, we performed a structure/function analysis of Mst1. A series of COOH-terminal and internal deletions indicates that there is an element within a central 63-amino acid region of the molecule that inhibits kinase activity. Removal of this domain increases kinase activity approximately 9-fold. Coimmunoprecipitation assays, the yeast two-hybrid procedure, and in vitro cross-linking analysis indicate that Mst1 homodimerizes and that the extreme COOH-terminal 57 amino acids are required for self-association. Size exclusion chromatography indicates that Mst1 is associated with a high molecular weight complex in cells, suggesting that other proteins may also oligomerize with this kinase. While loss of dimerization alone does not affect kinase activity, a molecule lacking both the dimerization and inhibitory domains is not as active as one which lacks only the inhibitory domain. Comparison of Mst1 and Mst2 indicates that both functional domains lie in regions conserved between the two molecules.

12592399|t|The H-NS dimerization domain defines a new fold contributing to DNA recognition.
12592399|t|H-NS, a protein found in Gram-negative bacteria, is involved in structuring the bacterial chromosome and acts as a global regulator for the expression of a wide variety of genes. These functions are correlated with both its DNA-binding and oligomerization properties. We have identified the minimal dimerization domain of H-NS, a 46 amino acid-long N-terminal fragment, and determined its structure using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The highly intertwined structure of the dimer, reminiscent of a handshake, defines a new structural fold, which may offer a possibility for discriminating prokaryotic from eukaryotic proteins in drug design. Using mutational analysis, we also show that this N-terminal domain actively contributes to DNA binding, conversely to the current paradigm. Together, our data allows us to propose a model for the action of full length H-NS.

7644498|t|The WW domain of Yes-associated protein binds a proline-rich ligand that differs from the consensus established for Src homology 3-binding modules.
7644498|t|The WW domain has previously been described as a motif of 38 semiconserved residues found in seemingly unrelated proteins, such as dystrophin, Yes-associated protein (YAP), and two transcriptional regulators, Rsp-5 and FE65. The molecular function of the WW domain has been unknown until this time. Using a functional screen of a cDNA expression library, we have identified two putative ligands of the WW domain of YAP, which we named WBP-1 and WBP-2. Peptide sequence comparison between the two partial clones revealed a homologous region consisting of a proline-rich domain followed by a tyrosine residue (with the shared sequence PPPPY), which we shall call the PY motif. Binding assays and site-specific mutagenesis have shown that the PY motif binds with relatively high affinity and specificity to the WW domain of YAP, with the preliminary consensus XPPXY being critical for binding. Herein, we have implicated the WW domain with a role in mediating protein-protein interactions, as a variant of the paradigm set by Src homology 3 domains and their proline-rich ligands.

21554542|t|ClpB, a member of the expanded superfamily of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+), forms a ring-shaped hexamer and cooperates with the DnaK chaperone system to reactivate aggregated proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. The ClpB protomer consists of an N-terminal domain, an AAA+ module (AAA-1), a middle domain, and a second AAA+ module (AAA-2). Each AAA+ module contains highly conserved WalkerA and WalkerB motifs, and two arginines (AAA-1) or one arginine (AAA-2). Here, we investigated the roles of these arginines (Arg322, Arg323, and Arg747) of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus in the ATPase cycle and chaperone function by alanine substitution. These mutations did not affect nucleotide binding, but did inhibit the hydrolysis of the bound ATP and slow the threading of the denatured protein through the central pore of the T. thermophilus ClpB ring, which severely impaired the chaperone functions. Previously, it was demonstrated that ATP binding to the AAA-1 module induced motion of the middle domain and stabilized the ClpB hexamer. However, the arginine mutations of the AAA-1 module destabilized the ClpB hexamer, even though ATP-induced motion of the middle domain was not affected. These results indicated that the three arginines are crucial for ATP hydrolysis and chaperone activity, but not for ATP binding. In addition, the two arginines in AAA-1 and the ATP-induced motion of the middle domain independently contribute to the stabilization of the hexamer.

23446637|t|Pathogenic NPHP5 mutations impair protein interaction with Cep290, a prerequisite for ciliogenesis.
23446637|t|Mutations in the human NPHP5 gene cause retinal and renal disease, but the precise mechanism by which NPHP5 functions is not understood. We report that NPHP5 is a centriolar protein whose depletion inhibits an early step of ciliogenesis, a phenotype reminiscent of Cep290 loss and contrary to IFT88 loss. Functional dissection of NPHP5 interactions with Cep290 and CaM reveals a requirement of the former for ciliogenesis, while the latter prevents NPHP5 self-aggregation. Disease-causing mutations lead to truncated products unable to bind Cep290 and localize to centrosomes, thereby compromising cilia formation. In contrast, a modifier mutation cripples CaM binding but has no overt effect on ciliogenesis. Drugs that antagonize negative regulators of the ciliogenic pathway can rescue ciliogenesis in cells depleted of NPHP5, with response profiles similar to those of Cep290- but not IFT88-depleted cells. Our results uncover the underlying molecular basis of disease and provide novel insights into mitigating NPHP5 deficiency.

22796944|t|Pol II CTD kinases Bur1 and Kin28 promote Spt5 CTR-independent recruitment of Paf1 complex.
22796944|t|Paf1 complex (Paf1C) is a transcription elongation factor whose recruitment is stimulated by Spt5 and the CDKs Kin28 and Bur1, which phosphorylate the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) on Serines 2, 5, and 7. Bur1 promotes Paf1C recruitment by phosphorylating C-terminal repeats (CTRs) in Spt5, and we show that Kin28 enhances Spt5 phosphorylation by promoting Bur1 recruitment. It was unclear, however, whether CTD phosphorylation by Kin28 or Bur1 also stimulates Paf1C recruitment. We find that Paf1C and its Cdc73 subunit bind diphosphorylated CTD repeats (pCTD) and phosphorylated Spt5 CTRs (pCTRs) in vitro, and that cdc73 mutations eliminating both activities reduce Paf1C recruitment in vivo. Phosphomimetic (acidic) substitutions in the Spt5 CTR sustain high-level Paf1C recruitment in otherwise wild-type cells, but not following inactivation of Bur1 or Kin28. Furthermore, inactivating the pCTD/pCTR-interaction domain (PCID) in Cdc73 decreases Paf1C-dependent histone methylation in cells containing non-phosphorylatable Spt5 CTRs. These results identify an Spt5 pCTR-independent pathway of Paf1C recruitment requiring Kin28, Bur1, and the Cdc73 PCID. We propose that pCTD repeats and Spt5 pCTRs provide separate interaction surfaces that cooperate to ensure high-level Paf1C recruitment.

11940652|t|Cdc42 regulation of kinase activity and signaling by the yeast p21-activated kinase Ste20.
11940652|t|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinase Ste20 is a member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family with several functions, including pheromone-responsive signal transduction. While PAKs are usually activated by small G proteins and Ste20 binds Cdc42, the role of Cdc42-Ste20 binding has been controversial, largely because Ste20 lacking its entire Cdc42-binding (CRIB) domain retains kinase activity and pheromone response. Here we show that, unlike CRIB deletion, point mutations in the Ste20 CRIB domain that disrupt Cdc42 binding also disrupt pheromone signaling. We also found that Ste20 kinase activity is stimulated by GTP-bound Cdc42 in vivo and this effect is blocked by the CRIB point mutations. Moreover, the Ste20 CRIB and kinase domains bind each other, and mutations that disrupt this interaction cause hyperactive kinase activity and bypass the requirement for Cdc42 binding. These observations demonstrate that the Ste20 CRIB domain is autoinhibitory and that this negative effect is antagonized by Cdc42 to promote Ste20 kinase activity and signaling. Parallel results were observed for filamentation pathway signaling, suggesting that the requirement for Cdc42-Ste20 interaction is not qualitatively different between the mating and filamentation pathways. While necessary for pheromone signaling, the role of the Cdc42-Ste20 interaction does not require regulation by pheromone or the pheromone-activated G beta gamma complex, because the CRIB point mutations also disrupt signaling by activated forms of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5. In total, our observations indicate that Cdc42 converts Ste20 to an active form, while pathway stimuli regulate the ability of this active Ste20 to trigger signaling through a particular pathway.

21763312|t|A single amino acid change in the transmembrane domain of the VirB8 protein affects dimerization, interaction with VirB10 and Brucella suis virulence.
21763312|t|VirB8 is a critical component of the Brucella suis type IV secretion system (T4SS). We previously showed that the transmembrane (TM) domain plays an essential role in interactions of this protein with itself and the other proteins of the T4SS. We report that a point mutation in this TM domain stabilizes homodimers of VirB8 and heterodimers with VirB10. A similar variant of Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB8 showed the same phenotype. The B. suis VirB8 variant was unable to complement a virB8 mutant and displayed a dominant negative phenotype when expressed in wild type B. suis. We suggest that interaction of VirB8 with VirB10 could play a major role in the correct function of the B. suis VirB T4SS.

14675757|t|Mapping eIF5A binding sites for Dys1 and Lia1: in vivo evidence for regulation of eIF5A hypusination.
14675757|t|The evolutionarily conserved factor eIF5A is the only protein known to undergo hypusination, a unique posttranslational modification triggered by deoxyhypusine synthase (Dys1). Although eIF5A is essential for cell viability, the function of this putative translation initiation factor is still obscure. To identify eIF5A-binding proteins that could clarify its function, we screened a two-hybrid library and identified two eIF-5A partners in S. cerevisiae: Dys1 and the protein encoded by the gene YJR070C, named Lia1 (Ligand of eIF5A). The interactions were confirmed by GST pulldown. Mapping binding sites for these proteins revealed that both eIF5A domains can bind to Dys1, whereas the C-terminal domain is sufficient to bind Lia1. We demonstrate for the first time in vivo that the N-terminal alpha-helix of Dys1 can modulate enzyme activity by inhibiting eIF5A interaction. We suggest that this inhibition be abrogated in the cell when hypusinated and functional eIF5A is required.

17276458|t|The Grb2/PLD2 interaction is essential for lipase activity, intracellular localization and signaling in response to EGF.
17276458|t|The adaptor protein Grb2 associates with phospholipase D2 (PLD2), but it is not known if this interaction is necessary for the functionality of the lipase in vivo. We demonstrate that stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based silencing of Grb2, a critical signal transducer of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and linker to the Ras/Erk pathway, resulted in the reduction of PLD2 activity in COS7 cells. Transfection of a Grb2 construct refractory to shGrb2 silencing (XGrb2(SiL)) into the Grb2-knockdown cells (COS7(shGrb2)), resulted in the nearly full rescue of PLD2 activity. However, Grb2-R86K, an SH2-deficient mutant of Grb2 that is incapable of binding to PLD2, failed to induce an enhancement of the impaired PLD2 activity in COS7(shGrb2) cells. Grb2 and PLD2 are directly associated and Grb2 is brought down with anti-myc antibodies irrespective of the presence or absence of EGFR activation. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that co-transfected PLD2 and Grb2 re-localize to Golgi-like structures after EGF stimulation. Since this was not observed in cotransfection experiments with Grb2 and PLD2-Y169/179F, a lipase mutant that does not bind to Grb2, we inferred that Grb2 serves to hijack PLD2 to the perinuclear Golgi region through its SH2 domain. Supporting this is the finding that the primary cell line HUVEC expresses PLD2 diffusely in the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear Golgi region, where PLD2 and Grb2 colocalize. Such colocalization in primary cells increased after stimulation with EGF. These results demonstrate for the first time that the presence of Grb2 and its interaction with localized intracellular structures is essential for PLD2 activity and signaling in vivo.

16203728|t|A role for Erbin in the regulation of Nod2-dependent NF-kappaB signaling.
16203728|t|Nod2 is an intracellular sensor of a specific bacterial cell wall component, muramyl dipeptide, and activation of Nod2 stimulates an inflammatory response. Specific mutations of Nod2 have been associated with two inflammatory diseases, Crohn disease and Blau syndrome, and are thought to contribute to disease susceptibility through altering Nod2 signaling. Association of disease with inappropriate activation of Nod2 highlights the importance of proper regulation of Nod2 activity. However, little is known about specific regulation of the Nod2 pathway. We performed a biochemical screen to discover potential regulators of Nod2 and identified Erbin, a protein involved in cell polarity, receptor localization, and regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as a novel Nod2-interacting protein. In our studies, we demonstrate specific interaction of Erbin and Nod2 both in vitro and in vivo and characterize the regions required for interaction in both proteins. We found that Nod2-dependent activation of NF-kappaB and cytokine secretion is inhibited by Erbin overexpression, whereas Erbin-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts show an increased sensitivity to muramyl dipeptide. These studies identify Erbin as a regulator of Nod2 signaling and demonstrate a novel role for Erbin in inflammatory responses.

16858409|t|Regulation of antiviral responses by a direct and specific interaction between TRAF3 and Cardif.
16858409|t|Upon recognition of viral infection, RIG-I and Helicard recruit a newly identified adapter termed Cardif, which induces type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses through an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that TRAF3, like Cardif, is required for type I interferon production in response to intracellular double-stranded RNA. Cardif-mediated IFNalpha induction occurs through a direct interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF3 and a TRAF-interaction motif (TIM) within Cardif. Interestingly, while the entire N-terminus of TRAF3 was functionally interchangeable with that of TRAF5, the TRAF domain of TRAF3 was not. Our data suggest that this distinction is due to an inability of the TRAF domain of TRAF5 to bind the TIM of Cardif. Finally, we show that preventing association of TRAF3 with this TIM by mutating two critical amino acids in the TRAF domain also abolishes TRAF3-dependent IFN production following viral infection. Thus, our findings suggest that the direct and specific interaction between the TRAF domain of TRAF3 and the TIM of Cardif is required for optimal Cardif-mediated antiviral responses.

9488135|t|Crystal structure of TNF-alpha mutant R31D with greater affinity for receptor R1 compared with R2.
9488135|t|Crystal structures have been determined of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its R31D mutant that preferentially binds to TNF receptor R1 with more than seven times the relative affinity of binding to receptor R2. Crystals of the wild-type TNF were of space group P4(1)2(1)2 and had unit cell dimensions of a = b = 94.7 and c = 117.4 A. Refinement of the structure gave an R-factor of 22.3% at 2.5 A resolution. The crystals of TNF R31D mutant diffracted to 2.3 A resolution, and were of identical space group to the wild type with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 95.4 and c = 116.2 A, and the structure was refined to an R-factor of 21.8%. The trimer structures of the wild-type and mutant TNF were similar with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.56 A for Calpha atoms; however, the subunits within each trimer were more variable with an average r.m.s. deviation of 1.00 A on Calpha atoms for pairwise comparison of subunits. Model complexes of TNF with receptors R1 and R2 have been used to predict TNF-receptor interactions. Arg31 in all three subunits of wild-type TNF is predicted to form an ionic interaction with the equivalent glutamic acid in both receptors R1 and R2. Asp31 of the TNF R31D mutant is predicted to interact differently with the two receptors. The side chain of Asp31 in two subunits of the TNF mutant is predicted to form hydrogen bond interactions with Ser59 or Cys70 of R1, while it has no predicted interactions with R2. The loss of three strong ionic interactions of Arg31 and the electrostatic repulsion of Asp31 with Glu in the receptors is consistent with the reduced binding of the R31D mutant to both receptors relative to wild-type TNF. The replacement of these ionic interactions by two weaker hydrogen bond interactions between Asp31 of the R31D mutant and R1, compared with no interactions with R2, is in agreement with the observed preferential binding of the R31D mutant to R1 over R2. Analysis of the structure and function of receptor-discriminating mutants of TNF will help understand the biological role of TNF and facilitate its use as an antitumor agent.

18256029|t|Identification of Alix-type and Non-Alix-type ALG-2-binding sites in human phospholipid scramblase 3: differential binding to an alternatively spliced isoform and amino acid-substituted mutants.
18256029|t|ALG-2, a prototypic member of the penta-EF-hand protein family, interacts with Alix at its C-terminal Pro-rich region containing four tandem PXY repeats. Human phospholipid scramblase 3 (PLSCR3) has a similar sequence (ABS-1) in its N-terminal region. In the present study, we found that ALG-2 interacts with PLSCR3 expressed in HEK293 cells in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused ALG-2 and an overlay assay using biotin-labeled ALG-2. The GST fusion protein of an alternatively spliced isoform of ALG-2, GST-ALG-2(DeltaGF122), pulled down green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused PLSCR3 but not GFP Alix. Deletion of a region containing ABS-1 was not sufficient to abrogate the binding. A second ALG-2-binding site (ABS-2) was essential for interaction with ALG-2(DeltaGF122). Real-time interaction analyses with a surface plasmon resonance biosensor using synthetic oligopeptides and recombinant proteins corroborated direct Ca(2+)-dependent binding of ABS-1 to ALG-2 and that of ABS-2 to ALG-2 as well as to ALG-2(DeltaGF122). The sequence of ABS-2 contains multiple prolines and two phenylalanines, among which Phe(49) was found to be critical, because its substitution with Ala or Tyr caused a loss of binding ability by pulldown assays using oligopeptide-immobilized beads. ALG-2-interacting proteins were classified into two groups based on binding ability to ALG-2(DeltaGF122): (i) isoform-non-interactive (ABS-1) types, including Alix, annexin A7, annexin A11, and TSG101 and (ii) isoform-interactive (ABS-2) types including PLSCR3, PLSCR4 and Sec31A. GST-pulldown assays using single amino acid-substituted ALG-2 mutants revealed differences in binding specificities between the two groups, suggesting structural flexibility in ALG-2-ligand complex formation.

11520064|t|Identification of a PDZ domain containing Golgi protein, GOPC, as an interaction partner of frizzled.
11520064|t|The frizzled gene is evolutionally conserved in a wide variety of organisms including mammals, and in Drosophila, frizzled is implicated in the development of planar polarity. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a Golgi protein, GOPC, as a frizzled interacting protein. GOPC comprises one PDZ domain, two coiled-coil motifs and two evolutionally conserved regions. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that a significant fraction of GOPC protein was localized in the Golgi apparatus. Using a series of deletion mutants, we show that both coiled-coil motifs and a C-terminal conserved region were required for its Golgi localization. Interestingly, deletion mutants that lack a N-terminal conserved region or coiled-coil motifs formed aggresome-like perinuclear structure. Interaction of GOPC and frizzled was observed both in vivo and in vitro, and the PDZ domain of GOPC and the C-terminal Ser/Thr-X-Val motif of frizzled were required for their interaction. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that, although frizzled was a membrane protein, it was localized at the Golgi apparatus as well, and colocalization of GOPC and frizzled at the Golgi apparatus was observed. Furthermore, when GOPC was coexpressed with frizzled, translocation of GOPC to the plasma membrane was observed. Importantly, brefeldin A interrupted not only the localization of GOPC to the Golgi apparatus but also the translocation of frizzled to the plasma membrane, indicating that the Golgi structure was required for the proper subcellular localization of frizzled. Taken together, these results indicate that GOPC may play a role in the vesicle transport of frizzled from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.

16000169|t|An in vivo analysis of the localisation and interactions of human p66 DNA polymerase delta subunit.
16000169|t|BACKGROUND: DNA polymerase delta is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication and also plays a role in DNA repair. The processivity of this polymerase complex is dependent upon its interaction with the sliding clamp PCNA and the polymerase-PCNA interaction is largely mediated through the p66 polymerase subunit. We have analysed the interactions of the human p66 DNA polymerase delta subunit with PCNA and with components of the DNA polymerase delta complex in vivo. RESULTS: Using the two-hybrid system, we have mapped the interaction domains for binding to the p50 polymerase delta subunit and with PCNA to the N-terminus and the C-terminus of p66, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that these interaction domains are functional in vivo. Expression of EGFP-p66 shows that it is a nuclear protein which co-localises with PCNA throughout the cell cycle. p66 is localised to sites of DNA replication during S phase and to repair foci following DNA damage. We have identified a functional nuclear localisation sequence and shown that localisation to replication foci is not dependent upon active nuclear import. Sub-domains of p66 act as dominant negative suppressors of colony formation, suggesting that p66 forms an essential structural link between the p50 subunit and PCNA. Analysis of the C-terminal PCNA binding motif shows that deletion of the QVSITGFF core motif results in a reduced affinity for PCNA, while deletion of a further 20 amino acids completely abolishes the interaction. A reduced affinity for PCNA correlates with reduced targeting to replication foci. We have confirmed the p66-PCNA interaction in vivo using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. CONCLUSION: We have defined the regions of p66 required for its interaction with PCNA and the p50 polymerase subunit. We demonstrate a functional link between PCNA interaction and localisation to replication foci and show that there is a direct interaction between p66 and PCNA in living cells during DNA replication. The dominant negative effect upon growth resulting from expression of p66 sub-domains confirms that the p66-PCNA interaction is essential in vivo.

21803990|t|Stepwise activity of ClpY (HslU) mutants in the processive degradation of Escherichia coli ClpYQ (HslUV) protease substrates.
21803990|t|In Escherichia coli, ClpYQ (HslUV) is a two-component ATP-dependent protease composed of ClpY (HslU), an ATPase with unfolding activity, and ClpQ (HslV), a peptidase. In the ClpYQ proteolytic complex, the hexameric rings of ClpY (HslU) are responsible for protein recognition, unfolding, and translocation into the proteolytic inner chamber of the dodecameric ClpQ (HslV). Each of the three domains, N, I, and C, in ClpY has its own distinct activity. The double loops (amino acids [aa] 137 to 150 and 175 to 209) in domain I of ClpY are necessary for initial recognition/tethering of natural substrates such as SulA, a cell division inhibitor protein. The highly conserved sequence GYVG (aa 90 to 93) pore I site, along with the GESSG pore II site (aa 265 to 269), contribute to the central pore of ClpY in domain N. These two central loops of ClpY are in the center of its hexameric ring in which the energy of ATP hydrolysis allows substrate translocation and then degradation by ClpQ. However, no data have been obtained to determine the effect of the central loops on substrate binding or as part of the processivity of the ClpYQ complex. Thus, we probed the features of ClpY important for substrate engagement and protease processivity via random PCR or site-specific mutagenesis. In yeast two-hybrid analysis and pulldown assays, using isolated ClpY mutants and the pore I or pore II site of ClpY, each was examined for its influence on the adjoining structural regions of the substrates. The pore I site is essential for the translocation of the engaged substrates. Our in vivo study of the ClpY mutants also revealed that an ATP-binding site in domain N, separate from its role in polypeptide (ClpY) oligomerization, is required for complex formation with ClpQ. Additionally, we found that the tyrosine residue at position 408 in ClpY is critical for stabilization of hexamer formation between subunits. Therefore, our studies suggest that stepwise activities of the ClpYQ protease are necessary to facilitate the processive degradation of its natural substrates.

7758105|t|The TNF receptor 1-associated protein TRADD signals cell death and NF-kappa B activation.
7758105|t|Many diverse activities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are signaled through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). We have identified a novel 34 kDa protein, designated TRADD, that specifically interacts with an intracellular domain of TNFR1 known to be essential for mediating programmed cell death. Overexpression of TRADD leads to two major TNF-induced responses, apoptosis and activation of NF-kappa B. The C-terminal 118 amino acids of TRADD are sufficient to trigger both of these activities and likewise sufficient for interaction with the death domain of TNFR1. TRADD-mediated cell death can be suppressed by the crmA gene, which encodes a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. However, NF-kappa B activation by TRADD is not inhibited by crmA expression, demonstrating that the signaling pathways for TNF-induced cell death and NF-kappa B activation are distinct.

9389648|t|Dual role of the Smad4/DPC4 tumor suppressor in TGFbeta-inducible transcriptional complexes.
9389648|t|Upon ligand binding, the receptors of the TGFbeta family phosphorylate Smad proteins, which then move into the nucleus where they activate transcription. To carry out this function, the receptor-activated Smads 1 and 2 require association with the product of deleted in pancreatic carcinoma, locus 4 (DPC4), Smad4. We investigated the step at which Smad4 is required for transcriptional activation. Smad4 is not required for nuclear translocation of Smads 1 or 2, or for association of Smad2 with a DNA binding partner, the winged helix protein FAST-1. Receptor-activated Smad2 takes Smad4 into the nucleus where they form a complex with FAST-1 that requires these three components to activate transcription. Smad4 contributes two functions: Through its amino-terminal domain, Smad4 promotes binding of the Smad2/Smad4/FAST-1 complex to DNA; through its carboxy-terminal domain, Smad4 provides an activation function required for Smad1 or Smad2 to stimulate transcription. The dual function of Smad4 in transcriptional activation underscores its central role in TGFbeta signaling.

16511560|t|Regulation of MDMX nuclear import and degradation by Chk2 and 14-3-3.
16511560|t|The MDM2 homolog MDMX is an important regulator of p53 during mouse embryonic development. DNA damage promotes MDMX phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and degradation by MDM2. Here we show that MDMX copurifies with 14-3-3, and DNA damage stimulates MDMX binding to 14-3-3. Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of MDMX on S367 is important for stimulating 14-3-3 binding, MDMX nuclear import by a cryptic nuclear import signal, and degradation by MDM2. Mutation of MDMX S367 inhibits ubiquitination and degradation by MDM2, and prevents MDMX nuclear import. Expression of 14-3-3 stimulates the degradation of phosphorylated MDMX. Chk2 and 14-3-3 cooperatively stimulate MDMX ubiquitination and overcome the inhibition of p53 by MDMX. These results suggest that MDMX-14-3-3 interaction plays a role in p53 response to DNA damage by regulating MDMX localization and stability.

14594812|t|Arabidopsis phospholipase Dalpha1 interacts with the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha-subunit through a motif analogous to the DRY motif in G-protein-coupled receptors.
14594812|t|Phospholipase D (PLD) and heterotrimeric G-protein both play important, diverse roles in cellular regulation and signal transduction. Here we have determined the physical interaction between plant PLD and the only canonical alpha-subunit (Galpha) of the G-protein in Arabidopsis thaliana and the molecular basis for the interaction. PLDalpha1 expressed in either Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis was co-precipitated with Galpha. PLDalpha1 contains a sequence motif analogous to the G alpha-interacting DRY motif normally conserved in G-protein-coupled receptors. Mutation of the central Lys residue PLD(K564A) of this motif abolished the PLDalpha1-Galpha binding, whereas mutation of the two flanking residues PLD(E563A) and PLD(F565A) decreased the binding. Addition of Galpha to PLDalpha1 inhibited PLDalpha1 activity, whereas the PLD(K564A) mutation that disrupted the Galpha-PLDalpha1 binding abolished the inhibition. GTP relieved the Galpha inhibition of PLDalpha1 activity and also inhibited the binding between PLDalpha1 and Galpha. Meanwhile, the PLDalpha1-Galpha interaction stimulated the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha. Therefore, these results have demonstrated the direct binding between Galpha and PLDalpha1, identified the DRY motif on PLDalpha1 as the site for the interaction, and indicated that the interaction modulates reciprocally the activities of PLDalpha1 and Galpha.

17666011|t|Identification and characterization of two closely related histone H4 arginine 3 methyltransferases in Arabidopsis thaliana.
17666011|t|Arginine methylation of histone H3 and H4 plays important roles in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes such as yeasts, fruitflies, nematode worms, fish and mammals; however, less is known in plants. In the present paper, we report the identification and characterization of two Arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine N-methyltransferases, AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, which exhibit high homology with human PRMT1. Both AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b methylated histone H4, H2A, and myelin basic protein in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis of the third arginine (R3) on the N-terminus of histone H4 to lysine (H4R3N) completely abolished the methylation of histone H4. When fused to GFP (green fluorescent protein), both methyltransferases localized to the cytoplasm as well as to the nucleus. Consistent with their subcellular distribution, GST (glutathione transferase) pull-down assays revealed an interaction between the two methyltransferases, suggesting that both proteins may act together in a functional unit. In addition, we demonstrated that AtFib2 (Arabidopsis thaliana fibrillarin 2), an RNA methyltransferase, is a potential substrate for AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b, and, furthermore, uncovered a direct interaction between the protein methyltransferase and the RNA methyltransferase. Taken together, our findings implicate AtPRMT1a and AtPRMT1b as H4-R3 protein arginine N-methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and may be involved in diverse biological processes inside and outside the nucleus.

9515927|t|In vivo protein interactions within the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III core.
9515927|t|The mechanisms that control the fidelity of DNA replication are being investigated by a number of approaches, including detailed kinetic and structural studies. Important tools in these studies are mutant versions of DNA polymerases that affect the fidelity of DNA replication. It has been suggested that proper interactions within the core of DNA polymerase III (Pol III) of Escherichia coli could be essential for maintaining the optimal fidelity of DNA replication (H. Maki and A. Kornberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:4389-4392, 1987). We have been particularly interested in elucidating the physiological role of the interactions between the DnaE (alpha subunit [possessing DNA polymerase activity]) and DnaQ (epsilon subunit [possessing 3'-->5' exonucleolytic proofreading activity]) proteins. In an attempt to achieve this goal, we have used the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system to analyze specific in vivo protein interactions. In this report, we demonstrate interactions between the DnaE and DnaQ proteins and between the DnaQ and HolE (theta subunit) proteins. We also tested the interactions of the wild-type DnaE and HolE proteins with three well-known mutant forms of DnaQ (MutD5, DnaQ926, and DnaQ49), each of which leads to a strong mutator phenotype. Our results show that the mutD5 and dnaQ926 mutations do not affect the epsilon subunit-alpha subunit and epsilon subunit-theta subunit interactions. However, the dnaQ49 mutation greatly reduces the strength of interaction of the epsilon subunit with both the alpha and the theta subunits. Thus, the mutator phenotype of dnaQ49 may be the result of an altered conformation of the epsilon protein, which leads to altered interactions within the Pol III core.

17641689|t|MED25 is distinct from TRAP220/MED1 in cooperating with CBP for retinoid receptor activation.
17641689|t|We isolated MED25, which associates with retinoic acid (RA)-bound retinoic acid receptor (RAR) through the C-terminal nuclear hormone receptor (NR) box/LxxLL motif, and increases RAR/RXR-mediated transcription. When tethered to a promoter, MED25 showed intrinsic transcriptional activity in its PTOV domain, which is likely accomplished by direct association with CBP. Reporter assays using dominant negatives of MED25 demonstrated the importance of the N-terminal Mediator-binding and C-terminal domains in CBP and RAR/RXR binding, which affect MED25 activity. Downregulation of MED25 specifically reduced RAR but not thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activity. Stimulation of RAR by MED25 was correlated with enhanced RA cytotoxicity in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed the RA-dependent recruitment of MED25 to the RARbeta2 promoter. Recruitment of CBP and TRAP220 was diminished by the overexpression of a MED25 NR box deletion mutant, and by treatment with MED25 siRNA. Time-course ChIP assays indicated that CBP, together with RAR and MED25, is recruited early, whereas TRAP220 is recruited later to the promoter. Our data suggest that MED25, in cooperation with CBP and Mediators through its distinct domains, imposes a selective advantage on RAR/RXR activation.

17719007|t|A conserved proline residue in the leucine zipper region of AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61 in Arabidopsis thaliana interferes with the formation of homodimer.
17719007|t|Two putative Arabidopsis E group bZIP transcript factors, AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61, are nuclear-localized and their transcriptional activation domain is in their N-terminal region. By searching GenBank, we found other eight plant homologues of AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61. All of them have a proline residue in the third heptad of zipper region. Yeast two-hybrid assay and EMSA showed that AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61 could not form homodimer while their mutant forms, AtbZIP34m and AtbZIP61m, which the proline residue was replaced by an alanine residue in the zipper region, could form homodimer and bind G-box element. These results suggest that the conserved proline residue interferes with the homodimer formation. However, both AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61 could form heterodimers with members of I group and S group transcription factors in which some members involved in vascular development. So we speculate that AtbZIP34 and AtbZIP61 may participate in plant development via interacting with other group bZIP transcription factors.

22510884|t|Distinct requirement for an intact dimer interface in wild-type, V600E and kinase-dead B-Raf signalling.
22510884|t|The dimerisation of Raf kinases involves a central cluster within the kinase domain, the dimer interface (DIF). Yet, the importance of the DIF for the signalling potential of wild-type B-Raf (B-Raf(wt)) and its oncogenic counterparts remains unknown. Here, we show that the DIF plays a pivotal role for the activity of B-Raf(wt) and several of its gain-of-function (g-o-f) mutants. In contrast, the B-Raf(V600E), B-Raf(insT) and B-Raf(G469A) oncoproteins are remarkably resistant to mutations in the DIF. However, compared with B-Raf(wt), B-Raf(V600E) displays extended protomer contacts, increased homodimerisation and incorporation into larger protein complexes. In contrast, B-Raf(wt) and Raf-1(wt) mediated signalling triggered by oncogenic Ras as well as the paradoxical activation of Raf-1 by kinase-inactivated B-Raf require an intact DIF. Surprisingly, the B-Raf DIF is not required for dimerisation between Raf-1 and B-Raf, which was inactivated by the D594A mutation, sorafenib or PLX4720. This suggests that paradoxical MEK/ERK activation represents a two-step mechanism consisting of dimerisation and DIF-dependent transactivation. Our data further implicate the Raf DIF as a potential target against Ras-driven Raf-mediated (paradoxical) ERK activation.

9398522|t|Clarification of the dimerization domain and its functional significance for the Escherichia coli nucleoid protein H-NS.
9398522|t|The Escherichia coli nucleoid protein, H-NS, functions as a global regulator for expression of a wide variety of genes. We recently analyzed the structure-function relationship of H-NS with special reference to the domains responsible for transcriptional repression and DNA-binding, respectively. However, identification of the presumed dimerization domain of H-NS and its functional significance was elusive. To address this particular issue, we first examined a set of N-terminally or C-terminally truncated forms of H-NS, in terms of their so-called dominant-negative effect on the in vivo function of the wild-type H-NS. The results showed that certain truncated forms exhibit such a dominant-negative effect, but others did not. As judged by the results of the dominant-negative effect, it was assumed that a relatively central portion of H-NS extending from residues 21 to 63 is involved in dimerization. This was confirmed by an in vitro chemical cross-linking analysis and a gel filtration analysis with these truncated forms of H-NS. Furthermore, the use of the dominant-negative phenotype, caused by a truncated form of H-NS (named N91), allowed us to isolate a missense mutant, which was expected to be specifically defective in dimerization. This mutant had an amino acid substitution at position 30 (Leu30 to Pro) in N91 consisting of the N-terminal 91 amino acids of H-NS. This mutant was indeed defective in the in vitro ability to form a heterodimer with the wild-type H-NS. When this particular single amino acid substitution was introduced into the full-length H-NS, the resultant H-NS mutant had lost the ability to form dimers in vitro and to function as a transcriptional repressor. These findings collectively provided us with evidence that the ability of H-NS to form a dimer is crucial for H-NS to function as a transcriptional repressor.

15483055|t|Dictyostelium PAKc is required for proper chemotaxis.
15483055|t|We have identified a new Dictyostelium p21-activated protein kinase, PAKc, that we demonstrate to be required for proper chemotaxis. PAKc contains a Rac-GTPase binding (CRIB) and autoinhibitory domain, a PAK-related kinase domain, an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol binding domain, and a C-terminal extension related to the Gbetagamma binding domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste20, the latter two domains being required for PAKc transient localization to the plasma membrane. In response to chemoattractant stimulation, PAKc kinase activity is rapidly and transiently activated, with activity levels peaking at approximately 10 s. pakc null cells exhibit a loss of polarity and produce multiple lateral pseudopodia when placed in a chemoattractant gradient. PAKc preferentially binds the Dictyostelium Rac protein RacB, and point mutations in the conserved CRIB that abrogate this binding result in misregulated kinase activation and chemotaxis defects. We also demonstrate that a null mutation lacking the PAK family member myosin I heavy chain kinase (MIHCK) shows mild chemotaxis defects, including the formation of lateral pseudopodia. A null strain lacking both PAKc and the PAK family member MIHCK exhibits severe loss of cell movement, suggesting that PAKc and MIHCK may cooperate to regulate a common chemotaxis pathway.

21460798|t|Mechanisms of pseudosubstrate inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex by Acm1.
21460798|t|The anaphase promoting complex (APC) is a ubiquitin ligase that promotes the degradation of cell-cycle regulators by the 26S proteasome. Cdc20 and Cdh1 are WD40-containing APC co-activators that bind destruction boxes (DB) and KEN boxes within substrates to recruit them to the APC for ubiquitination. Acm1 is an APC(Cdh1) inhibitor that utilizes a DB and a KEN box to bind Cdh1 and prevent substrate binding, although Acm1 itself is not a substrate. We investigated what differentiates an APC substrate from an inhibitor. We identified the Acm1 A-motif that interacts with Cdh1 and together with the DB and KEN box is required for APC(Cdh1) inhibition. A genetic screen identified Cdh1 WD40 domain residues important for Acm1 A-motif interaction and inhibition that appears to reside near Cdh1 residues important for DB recognition. Specific lysine insertion mutations within Acm1 promoted its ubiquitination by APC(Cdh1) whereas lysine removal from the APC substrate Hsl1 converted it into a potent APC(Cdh1) inhibitor. These findings suggest that tight Cdh1 binding combined with the inaccessibility of ubiquitinatable lysines contributes to pseudosubstrate inhibition of APC(Cdh1).

7561682|t|Direct association of pp125FAK with paxillin, the focal adhesion-targeting mechanism of pp125FAK.
7561682|t|Focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK) is localized to focal adhesions and tyrosine phosphorylated by the engagement of beta 1 integrins. However, it is unclear how pp125FAK is linked to integrin molecules. We demonstrate that pp125FAK is directly associated with paxillin, a 68-kD cytoskeleton protein. The COOH-terminal domain of pp125FAK spanning FAK residues 919-1042 is sufficient for paxillin binding and has vinculin-homologous amino acids, which are essential for paxillin binding. Microinjection and subsequent immunohistochemical analysis reveal that glutathione S-transferase-FAK fusion proteins, which bind to paxillin, localize to focal adhesions, whereas fusion proteins with no paxillin-binding activity do not localize to focal adhesions. These findings strongly suggest that pp125FAK is localized to focal adhesions by the direct association with paxillin.

11231056|t|NudE-L, a novel Lis1-interacting protein, belongs to a family of vertebrate coiled-coil proteins.
11231056|t|The LIS1-encoded protein (Lis1) plays a role in brain development because a hemizygous deletion or mutation of the human gene causes neuronal migration disorders, such as Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) or isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a novel protein that interacts with mouse Lis1 (mLis1) which is termed mouse NudE-like protein (mNudE-L) because of its 49% amino acid conservation with NudE, a protein involved in nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans. GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation of fusion proteins expressed in mammalian cells confirmed the interaction of mLis1 and mNudE-L. mNudE-L gives rise to a approximately 2.3 kb mRNA and encodes an ORF corresponding to approximately 38 kDa protein. The overall amino acid sequence of mNudE-L is 49-95% identical to proteins found in a variety of organisms, thus establishing mNudE-L as a new member of a protein family. The hallmark of this family is an N-terminal region predicted to form a coiled-coil domain. We show that mNudE-L and mLis1 are coexpressed in the postnatal and adult cerebral cortices and in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. In contrast to mLis1, mNudE-L transcripts are absent in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb and in the inward migrating granular neurons of the developing cerebellum. Mutant mLis1 proteins modelling mutations found in human lissencephaly patients fail to interact with mNudE-L, raising the possibility that phenotypic changes result, in part, from the inability of mutant Lis1 proteins to interact with the human NudE-L polypeptide.

19013460|t|Thiamin-dependent transactivation activity of PDC2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
19013460|t|Yeast genes involved in thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) synthesis are transcriptionally induced in response to thiamin starvation. In this system, three proteins (Thi2p, Thi3p, and Pdc2p) act as positive regulatory factors. Thi3p is a TPP-binding protein and upregulates THI genes expression when TPP is not bound. We found here that Pdc2p could transactivate gene expression and interact with Thi3p, both of which were enhanced by thiamin starvation. This enhancement of the transactivation activity was not observed in a thi3 strain. When the C-terminal region containing the deduced Thi3p-interacting domain was truncated, Pdc2p expressed striking transactivation activity in a Thi3p-independent fashion. We explored the hypothesis that Thi3p causes a conformational change in Pdc2p leading to full transactivation activity under favorable conditions.

8940045|t|Factor VII central. A novel mutation in the catalytic domain that reduces tissue factor binding, impairs activation by factor Xa, and abolishes amidolytic and coagulant activity.
8940045|t|Factor VII is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of a serine protease that participates in the initial phase of blood coagulation. A factor VII molecular variant (factor VII Central) was identified in a 24-year-old male with severe factor VII deficiency and whose plasma factor VII antigen was 38% of normal, but expressed <1% factor VII procoagulant activity. DNA sequence analysis of the patient's factor VII gene revealed a thymidine to cytidine transition at nucleotide 10907 in exon VIII that results in a novel amino acid substitution of Phe328 to Ser. The patient was homozygous for this mutation, whereas each parent of the patient was heterozygous for this mutation. To investigate the molecular properties of this variant, a recombinant F328S factor VII mutant was prepared and analyzed in relation to wild-type factor VII. F328S factor VII exhibited <1% factor VII procoagulant activity and a 2-fold decreased affinity for tissue factor and failed to activate factor X or IX in the presence of tissue factor following activation by factor Xa. In addition, F328S factor VIIa exhibited no detectable amidolytic activity in the presence of tissue factor. The rate of F328S factor VII activation by factor Xa was markedly decreased relative to the rate of wild-type factor VII activation as revealed by densitometry scanning of SDS gels. Temporal analysis of this reaction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis also revealed the formation of two novel F328S factor VII degradation products (40 and 9 kDa) resulting from factor Xa proteolysis of the Arg315-Lys316 peptide bond in intact F328S factor VII. Computer modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the serine protease domain of factor VIIa suggested that the inability of F328S factor VIIa to cleave substrates may result from the apparent formation of a hydrogen bond between Tyr377 and Asp338, a residue at the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket important for the interaction of substrate arginine side chains with the enzyme. These findings suggest that Phe328, which is conserved in prothrombin, factor IX, factor X, factor VII, and trypsin, is important for factor VIIa catalysis.

21697476|t|Cellular transcription factor Oct-1 interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus BRLF1 protein to promote disruption of viral latency.
21697476|t|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent-to-lytic switch is an essential part of the viral life cycle, but the cellular factors that promote viral reactivation are not well defined. In this report, we demonstrate that the cellular transcription factor Oct-1 cooperates with the EBV immediate-early protein BRLF1 (R, Rta) to induce lytic viral reactivation. We show that cotransfected Oct-1 enhances the ability of BRLF1 to activate lytic gene expression in 293 cells stably infected with a BRLF1-defective EBV mutant (BRLF1-stop) and that Oct-1 increases BRLF1-mediated activation of lytic EBV promoters in reporter gene assays. We find that Oct-1 interacts directly with BRLF1 in vitro and that a mutant BRLF1 protein (the M140A mutant) attenuated for the ability to interact with Oct-1 in vitro is also resistant to Oct-1-mediated transcriptional enhancement in 293 BRLF1-stop cells. Furthermore, we show that cotransfected Oct-1 augments BRLF1 binding to a variety of lytic EBV promoters in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (including the BZLF1, BMRF1, and SM promoters) and that BRLF1 tethers Oct-1 to lytic EBV promoters. In addition, we demonstrate that an Oct-1 mutant defective in DNA binding (the S335D mutant) still retains the ability to enhance BRLF1 transcriptional effects. Finally, we show that knockdown of endogenous Oct-1 expression reduces the level of constitutive lytic EBV gene expression in both EBV-positive B-cell and EBV-positive epithelial cell lines. These results suggest that Oct-1 acts as a positive regulator of EBV lytic gene expression and that this effect is at least partially mediated through its interaction with the viral protein BRLF1.

10531343|t|Conserved N-terminal cysteine motif is essential for homo- and heterodimer formation of synaptotagmins III, V, VI, and X.
10531343|t|The synaptotagmins now constitute a large family of membrane proteins characterized by one transmembrane region and two C2 domains. Dimerization of synaptotagmin (Syt) I, a putative low affinity Ca(2+) sensor for neurotransmitter release, is thought to be important for expression of function during exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. However, little is known about the self-dimerization properties of other isoforms. In this study, we demonstrate that a subclass of synaptotagmins (III, V, VI, and X) (Ibata, K., Fukuda, M., and Mikoshiba, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12267-12273) forms beta-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimers and identify three evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues at the N terminus (N-terminal cysteine motif, at amino acids 10, 21, and 33 of mouse Syt III) that are not conserved in other isoforms. Site-directed mutagenesis of these cysteine residues and co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly indicate that the first cysteine residue is essential for the stable homodimer formation of Syt III, V, or VI, and heterodimer formation between Syts III, V, VI, and X. We also show that native Syt III from mouse brain forms a beta-mercaptoethanol-sensitive homodimer. Our results suggest that the cysteine-based heterodimerization between Syt III and Syt V, VI, or X, which have different biochemical properties, may modulate the proposed function of Syt III as a putative high affinity Ca(2+) sensor for neurotransmitter release.

16963136|t|An ITIM-like motif within the CCK2 receptor sequence required for interaction with SHP-2 and the activation of the AKT pathway.
16963136|t|SHP-2 is a tyrosine phosphatase which functions as a positive regulator downstream of RTKs, activating growth-stimulatory signalling pathways. To date, very few G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to be connected to SHP-2 and very little is known about the positive role of SHP-2 in GPCR signalling. The CCK2 receptor (CCK2R), a GPCR, is now recognized to mediate mitogenic effects of gastrin on gastrointestinal cells. In the present study, we demonstrate the role of SHP-2 in the activation of the AKT pathway by the CCK2R in COS-7 cells transfected with the CCK2R and in a pancreatic cancer cell line expressing the endogenous receptor. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we identified a highly conserved ITIM motif, containing the tyrosine residue 438, located in the C-terminal intracellular tail of the CCK2R which directly interacts with the SHP-2 SH2 domains. The interaction was confirmed by pull down assays and co-immunoprecipitation of the receptor with SHP-2. This interaction was transiently increased following gastrin stimulation of the CCK2R and correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. Mutational analysis of the key ITIM residue 438 confirmed that the CCK2R ITIM sequence is required for interaction with SHP-2 and the activation of the AKT pathway.

22661693|t|Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase K enables growth adaptation through translation control.
22661693|t|Mycobacterium tuberculosis serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) are responsible for orchestrating critical metabolic and physiological changes that dictate mycobacterial growth adaptation. Previously, we established that PknK participates in regulatory pathways that slow the growth of M. tuberculosis in a variety of in vitro stress environments and during persistent infection in mice. In the present study, we have elaborated on the mechanism of PknK-mediated regulation. Through transcription profiling of wild-type H37Rv and a /\pknK mutant strain during logarithmic and stationary growth phases, we determined that PknK regulates the expression of a large subset of tRNA genes so that regulation is synchronized with growth phase and cellular energy status. Elevated levels of wild-type M. tuberculosis PknK (PknK(Mtb)), but not phosphorylation-defective PknK(Mtb), in Mycobacterium smegmatis cause significant retardation of the growth rate and altered colony morphology. We investigated a role for PknK in translational control and established that PknK directs the inhibition of in vitro transcription and translation processes in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of ATP or PknK exert cooperative effects and enhance the inhibitory function of PknK. Furthermore, truncation and mutational analyses of PknK revealed that PknK is autoregulated via intramolecular interactions with its C-terminal region. Significantly, the invariant lysine 55 residue was only essential for activity in the full-length PknK protein, and the truncated mutant proteins were active. A model for PknK autoregulation is proposed and discussed.

25174448|t|Biophysical and structural characterization of a folded core domain within the proregion of growth and differentiation factor-5.
25174448|t|The structure and function(s) of the very large proregions of the transforming growth factor-b structure family are known in only a few cases. The proregion of growth and differentiation factor (GDF)5 comprises 354 residues. GDF5 therefore belongs to the group of those growth factors with the largest proregions. Here, we report a biophysical analysis of the proform (proGDF5) and the separate proregion. In the absence of the mature part, the proregion folds reversibly to form a monomeric polypeptide that is stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond. In the context of the mature part, i.e. in proGDF5, the proregion shows increased thermodynamic stability and contains a higher proportion of secondary structural elements than in its isolated form. A subdomain within the proregion represents a well-folded structure as monitored via biophysical analysis and NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, two point mutations that are associated with skeletal malformations lead to reduced thermodynamic stability, which is interpreted on the basis of a homology model with the structure of the related latency-associated peptide, representing the proregion of transforming growth factor-b1.

20935100|t|Crl binds to domain 2 of   (S) and confers a competitive advantage on a natural rpoS mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi.
20935100|t|The RpoS sigma factor (  (S)) is the master regulator of the bacterial response to a variety of stresses. Mutants in rpoS arise in bacterial populations in the absence of stress, probably as a consequence of a subtle balance between self-preservation and nutritional competence. We characterized here one natural rpoS mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Ty19). We show that the rpoS allele of Ty19 (rpoS(Ty19)) led to the synthesis of a   (S)(Ty19) protein carrying a single glycine-to-valine substitution at position 282 in   (S) domain 4, which was much more dependent than the wild-type   (S) protein on activation by Crl, a chaperone-like protein that increases the affinity of   (S) for the RNA polymerase core enzyme (E). We used the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid system to demonstrate that Crl bound to residues 72 to 167 of   (S) domain 2 and that G282V substitution did not directly affect Crl binding. However, this substitution drastically reduced the ability of   (S)(Ty19) to bind E in a surface plasmon resonance assay, a defect partially rescued by Crl. The modeled structure of the E  (S) holoenzyme suggested that substitution G282V could directly disrupt a favorable interaction between   (S) and E. The rpoS(Ty19) allele conferred a competitive fitness when the bacterial population was wild type for crl but was outcompeted in /\crl populations. Thus, these results indicate that the competitive advantage of the rpoS(Ty19) mutant is dependent on Crl and suggest that crl plays a role in the appearance of rpoS mutants in bacterial populations.

10660620|t|PILRalpha, a novel immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-bearing protein, recruits SHP-1 upon tyrosine phosphorylation and is paired with the truncated counterpart PILRbeta.
10660620|t|SHP-1-mediated dephosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues is central to the regulation of several cell signaling pathways, the specificity of which is dictated by the intrinsic affinity of SH2 domains for the flanking sequences of phosphotyrosine residues. By using a modified yeast two-hybrid system and SHP-1 as bait, we have cloned a human cDNA, PILRalpha, encoding a 303-amino acid immunoglobulin-like transmembrane receptor bearing two cytoplasmic tyrosines positioned within an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. Substrate trapping in combination with pervanadate treatment of 293T cells confirms that PILRalpha associates with SHP-1 in vivo upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Mutation of the tyrosine residues in PILRalpha indicates the pivotal role of the Tyr-269 residue in recruiting SHP-1. Surface plasmon resonance analysis further suggests that the association between PILRalpha-Tyr-269 and SHP-1 is mediated primarily via the amino-terminal SH2 domain of the latter. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA in combination with genomic sequence analysis revealed a second gene, PILRbeta, coding for a putative activating receptor as suggested by a truncated cytoplasmic tail and a charged lysine residue in its transmembrane region. The PILRalpha and PILRbeta genes are localized to chromosome 7 which is in contrast with the mapping of known members of the inhibitory receptor superfamily.

21360678|t|Label-free quantitative proteomics and SAINT analysis enable interactome mapping for the human Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5.
21360678|t|Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) represents a powerful and proven approach for the analysis of protein-protein interactions. However, the detection of true interactions for proteins that are commonly considered background contaminants is currently a limitation of AP-MS. Here using spectral counts and the new statistical tool, Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT), true interaction between the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and a chaperonin, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), is discerned. Furthermore, we report and validate a new interaction between PP5 and an Hsp90 adaptor protein, stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1; HOP). Mutation of PP5, replacing key basic amino acids (K97A and R101A) in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) region known to be necessary for the interactions with Hsp90, abolished both the known interaction of PP5 with cell division cycle 37 homolog and the novel interaction of PP5 with stress-induced phosphoprotein 1. Taken together, the results presented demonstrate the usefulness of label-free quantitative proteomics and statistical tools to discriminate between noise and true interactions, even for proteins normally considered as background contaminants.

15169891|t|Erk/Src phosphorylation of cortactin acts as a switch on-switch off mechanism that controls its ability to activate N-WASP.
15169891|t|The Arp2/3 complex can be independently activated to initiate actin polymerization by the VCA domain of WASP family members and by the acidic N-terminal and F-actin-binding repeat region of cortactin, which possesses a C-terminal SH3 domain. Cortactin is a target for phosphorylation by Src tyrosine kinases and by serine/threonine kinases that include Erk. Here we demonstrate that cortactin binds N-WASP and WASP via its SH3 domain, induces in vitro N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization, and colocalizes with N-WASP and WASP at sites of active actin polymerization. Erk phosphorylation and a mimicking S405,418D double mutation enhanced cortactin binding and activation of N-WASP. In contrast, Src phosphorylation inhibited the ability of cortactin previously phosphorylated by Erk, and that of S405,418D double mutant cortactin, to bind and activate N-WASP. Furthermore, Y-->D mutation of three tyrosine residues targeted by Src (Y421, Y466, and Y482) inhibited the ability of S405,418D cortactin to activate N-WASP. We propose that Erk phosphorylation liberates the SH3 domain of cortactin from intramolecular interactions with proline-rich regions, causing it to synergize with WASP and N-WASP in activating the Arp2/3 complex, and that Src phosphorylation terminates cortactin activation of N-WASP and WASP.

21435037|t|Interaction of the Salmonella Typhimurium effector protein SopB with host cell Cdc42 is involved in intracellular replication.
21435037|t|The phosphoinositide phosphatase SopB/SigD is a type III secretion system effector that plays multiple roles in Salmonella internalization and intracellular survival. We previously reported that SopB complexed with and inhibited the small GTPase Cdc42 when expressed in a yeast model system, independently of its phosphatase activity. Here we show that human Cdc42, but not Rac1, interacts with catalytically inactive SopB when coexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurs with both constitutively active and non-activatable Cdc42, suggesting that SopB binds Cdc42 independently of its activation state. By mutational analysis we have narrowed the Cdc42-interacting region of SopB to the first 142 amino acids, and isolated a collection of point mutations in this region, mainly affecting leucine residues conserved in the related Shigella IpgD protein. Such mutations yielded SopB unable to interact with Cdc42 but maintained phosphatase activity. SopB mutant proteins defective for binding Cdc42 were ubiquitinated upon translocation in mammalian cells, but their localization to the Salmonella-containing vacuole was reduced compared with wild-type SopB. Whereas invasion of mammalian cells by Salmonella bearing these sopB mutations was not affected, intracellular replication was less efficient, suggesting that SopB-Cdc42 interaction contributes to the adaptation of Salmonella to the intracellular environment.

18923418|t|The IQGAP Iqg1 is a regulatory target of CDK for cytokinesis in Candida albicans.
18923418|t|Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) drive and coordinate multiple cell-cycle events, including construction and contraction of the actomyosin ring during cytokinesis. However, it remains unclear whether CDKs regulate cytokinesis by directly targeting components of the ring. In a search for proteins containing consensus CDK phosphorylation sites in Candida albicans, we found that the IQGAP Iqg1 contains two dense clusters of 19 such sites flanking the actin-interacting CH domain. Here, we show that Iqg1 is indeed a phosphoprotein that undergoes cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation and can be phosphorylated by purified Clb-Cdc28 kinases in vitro. Mass spectrometry identified several phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues among these CDK sites. Mutating 15 of the CDK phosphorylation sites with alanine markedly reduced Iqg1 phosphorylation in vivo. The 15A mutation greatly stabilized Iqg1, caused both premature assembly and delayed disassembly of the actomyosin ring, blocked Iqg1 interaction with the actin-nucleating proteins Bni1 and Bnr1, and resulted in defects in cytokinesis. Our data therefore strongly support the idea that the Cdc28 CDK regulates cytokinesis partly by directly phosphorylating the actomyosin ring component Iqg1.

21172304|t|BTG2 is an LXXLL-dependent co-repressor for androgen receptor transcriptional activity.
21172304|t|The tumor suppressor gene, BTG2 has been down-regulated in prostate cancer and the ectopic expression of this gene has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Sequence analysis revealed that the BTG2 protein contains two leucine-rich motifs ((20)LxxLL(24) and (92)LxxLL(96)), which are usually found in nuclear receptor co-factors. Based on this, we postulated that there will be an association between BTG2 and AR. In this study, we discovered that BTG2 directly bound to the androgen receptor (AR) in the absence of 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and in the presence of the androgen, this interaction was increased. BTG2 bearing the mutant (20)LxxLL(24) motif bound to AR equally efficient as the wild-type BTG2, while BTG2 bearing the mutant (92)LxxLL(96) motif failed to interact with AR. Functional studies indicated that ectopic expression of BTG2 caused a significant inhibition of AR-mediated transcriptional activity and a decreased growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen-induced promoter activation and expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are significantly attenuated by BTG2. The intact (92)LxxLL(96) motif is required for these activities. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate that BTG2 complexes with AR via an LxxLL-dependent mechanism and may play a role in prostate cancer via modulating the AR signaling pathway.

15716268|t|SIRT1 functionally interacts with the metabolic regulator and transcriptional coactivator PGC-1{alpha}.
15716268|t|In lower organisms, increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 augments lifespan. The mechanism through which this life extension is mediated remains incompletely understood. Here we have examined the cellular effects of overexpression of SIRT1, the closest mammalian ortholog of Sir2. In PC12 cells, increased expression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 reduces cellular oxygen consumption by approximately 25%. We further demonstrate that SIRT1 expression can alter the transcriptional activity of the mitochondrial biogenesis coactivator PGC-1alpha. In addition, SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha directly interact and can be co-immunoprecipitated as a molecular complex. A single amino acid mutation in the putative ADP-ribosyltransferase domain of SIRT1 inhibits the interaction of SIRT1 with PGC-1alpha but does not effect the interaction of SIRT1 with either p53 or Foxo3a. We further show that PGC-1alpha is acetylated in vivo. This acetylation is augmented by treatment with the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide or by expression of the transcriptional coactivator p300. Finally we demonstrate that SIRT1 catalyzes PGC-1alpha deacetylation both in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a direct link between the sirtuins, a family of proteins linked to lifespan determination and PGC-1alpha, a coactivator that regulates cellular metabolism.

19860830|t|The interaction between casein kinase Ialpha and 14-3-3 is phosphorylation dependent.
19860830|t|We have previously shown that casein kinase (CK) Ialpha from mammalian brain phosphorylates 14-3-3 zeta and tau isoforms on residue 233. In the present study, we show that CKIalpha associates with 14-3-3 both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction between CKIalpha and 14-3-3 is dependent on CKIalpha phosphorylation, unlike centaurin-alpha1 (also known as ADAP1), which binds to unphosphorylated CKIalpha on the same region. CKIalpha preferentially interacts with mammalian eta and gamma 14-3-3 isoforms, and peptides that bind to the 14-3-3 binding pocket prevent this interaction. The region containing Ser218 in this CKIalpha binding site was mutated and the interaction between CKIalpha and 14-3-3 was reduced. We subsequently identified a second phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding site within CKIalpha containing Ser242 that may be the principal site of interaction. We also show that both fission and budding yeast CKI kinase homologues phosphorylate mammalian and budding yeast (BMH1 and BMH2) 14-3-3 at the equivalent site.

20801936|t|Tel2 structure and function in the Hsp90-dependent maturation of mTOR and ATR complexes.
20801936|t|We reported previously that the stability of all mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs) depends on their interaction with Tel2, the ortholog of yeast Tel2 and Caenorhabditis elegans Clk-2. Here we provide evidence that Tel2 acts with Hsp90 in the maturation of PIKK complexes. Quantitative immunoblotting showed that the abundance of Tel2 is low compared with the PIKKs, and Tel2 preferentially bound newly synthesized ATM, ATR, mTOR, and DNA-PKcs. Tel2 complexes contained, in addition to Tti1-Tti2, the Hsp90 chaperone, and inhibition of Hsp90 interfered with the interaction of Tel2 with the PIKKs. Analysis of in vivo labeled nascent protein complexes showed that Tel2 and Hsp90 mediate the formation of the mTOR TORC1 and TORC2 complexes and the association of ATR with ATRIP. The structure of yeast Tel2, reported here, shows that Tel2 consists of HEAT-like helical repeats that assemble into two separate a-solenoids. Through mutagenesis, we identify a surface patch of conserved residues involved in binding to the Tti1-Tti2 complex in vitro. In vivo, mutation of this conserved patch affects cell growth, levels of PIKKs, and ATM/ATR-mediated checkpoint signaling, highlighting the importance of Tti1-Tti2 binding to the function of Tel2. Taken together, our data suggest that the Tel2-Tti1-Tti2 complex is a PIKK-specific cochaperone for Hsp90.

16239229|t|Leu309 plays a critical role in the encapsulation of substrate protein into the internal cavity of GroEL.
16239229|t|In the crystal structure of the native GroEL.GroES.substrate protein complex from Thermus thermophilus, one GroEL subunit makes contact with two GroES subunits. One contact is through the H-I helices, and the other is through a novel GXXLE region. The side chain of Leu, in the GXXLE region, forms a hydrophobic cluster with residues of the H helix (Shimamura, T., Koike-Takeshita, A., Yokoyama, K., Masui, R., Murai, N., Yoshida, M., Taguchi, H., and Iwata, S. (2004) Structure (Camb.) 12, 1471-1480). Here, we investigated the functional role of Leu in the GXXLE region, using Escherichia coli GroEL. The results are as follows: (i) cross-linking between introduced cysteines confirmed that the GXXLE region in the E. coli GroEL.GroES complex is also in contact with GroES; (ii) when Leu was replaced by Lys (GroEL(L309K)) or other charged residues, chaperone activity was largely lost; (iii) the GroEL(L309K).substrate complex failed to bind GroES to produce a stable GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex, whereas free GroEL(L309K) bound GroES normally; (iv) the GroEL(L309K).GroES.substrate complex was stabilized with BeF(x), but the substrate protein in the complex was readily digested by protease, indicating that it was not properly encapsulated into the internal cavity of the complex. Thus, conformational communication between the two GroES contact sites, the H helix and the GXXLE region (through Leu(309)), appears to play a critical role in encapsulation of the substrate.

16438971|t|A novel yeast two-hybrid approach to identify CDPK substrates: characterization of the interaction between AtCPK11 and AtDi19, a nuclear zinc finger protein.
16438971|t|Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are sensor-transducer proteins capable of decoding calcium signals in diverse phosphorylation-dependent calcium signaling networks in plants and some protists. Using a novel yeast two-hybrid (YTH) approach with constitutively active and/or catalytically inactive forms of AtCPK11 as bait, we identified AtDi19 as an AtCPK11-interacting protein. AtDi19 is a member of a small family of stress-induced genes. The interaction was confirmed using pull-down assays with in vitro translated AtCPK11 and GST-AtDi19 and localization studies in Arabidopsis protoplasts cotransfected with AtCPK11:GFP and AtDi19:DsRed2 protein fusions. We further showed that the interaction of AtDi19 is specific to both AtCPK4 and AtCPK11, whereas other closely related CPKs from Arabidopsis interacted weakly (e.g., AtCPK12) or did not interact (e.g., AtCPK26, AtCPK5 and AtCPK1) with AtDi19. Deletion analyses showed that a region containing two predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) of AtDi19 is essential for interaction with AtCPK11. We further demonstrated that AtDi19 is phosphorylated by AtCPK11 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner at Thr105 and Ser107 within the AtDi19 bipartite NLS using in vitro kinase assays. Our data suggest that disruption of the autoinhibitor domain leading to the formation of a constitutively active CDPK may stabilize kinase-substrate interactions without affecting specificity.

12839993|t|Arabidopsis AXR6 encodes CUL1 implicating SCF E3 ligases in auxin regulation of embryogenesis.
12839993|t|The AXR6 gene is required for auxin signaling in the Arabidopsis embryo and during postembryonic development. One of the effects of auxin is to stimulate degradation of the Aux/IAA auxin response proteins through the action of the ubiquitin protein ligase SCF(TIR1). Here we show that AXR6 encodes the SCF subunit CUL1. The axr6 mutations affect the ability of mutant CUL1 to assemble into stable SCF complexes resulting in reduced degradation of the SCF(TIR1) substrate AXR2/IAA7. In addition, we show that CUL1 is required for lateral organ initiation in the shoot apical meristem and the inflorescence meristem. These results indicate that the embryonic axr6 phenotype is related to a defect in SCF function and accumulation of Aux/IAA proteins such as BDL/IAA12. In addition, we show that CUL1 has a role in auxin response throughout the life cycle of the plant.

15674350|t|Structural determinants of the BRCA1 : estrogen receptor interaction.
15674350|t|Previously, we showed that the BRCA1 protein interacts directly and functionally with estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), resulting in the inhibition of estradiol (E2)-stimulated ER-alpha transcriptional activity. The interaction sites were mapped to the N-terminus of BRCA1 (within amino acids (aa) 1-302) and the ligand-binding domain/activation function-2 (LBD/AF-2) region (within aa 282-420) of ER-alpha. In this study, we have further characterized the structure/function relationship for the BRCA1 : ER-alpha interaction. We found that the N-terminal RING domain (aa 20-64) is not required for the BRCA1 : ER-alpha interaction. We identified two separate contact points for ER-alpha, one within aa 1-100 and the other within aa 100-200 of BRCA1; and we showed that each of these BRCA1 peptides interacts with BRCA1 in vitro and in vivo. By using different fragments of the BRCA1 N-terminus, we found that aa 67-100 and 101-133 are required for the interaction with ER-alpha, but that aa 1-67 and 134-302 are dispensible. Previously, we showed that BRCA1 aa 1-302 does not inhibit E2-stimulated ER-alpha transcriptional activity but does bind to ER-alpha and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of the full-length BRCA1 protein. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that BRCA1 aa 1-100 and BRCA1 aa 101-200 (but not aa 201-300) each inhibited ER-alpha activity, although not as efficiently as full-length BRCA1. Mutations within an HIV Rev-like nuclear export signal that resembles a nuclear receptor corepressor motif (aa 86-95) impaired the ability of both truncated (aa 1-100) and full-length (aa 1-1863) BRCA1 proteins to interact with and/or repress ER-alpha activity. Based on these findings, a partial BRCA1 : ER-alpha three-dimensional structure is proposed. The implications of these findings for understanding the BRCA1 : ER-alpha interaction are discussed.

26278368|t|An additional cysteine in a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin of Pseudomonas promotes functional switching between peroxidase and molecular chaperone.
26278368|t|UNASSIGNED: Peroxiredoxins (Prx) have received considerable attention during recent years. This study demonstrates that two typical Pseudomonas-derived 2-Cys Prx proteins, PpPrx and PaPrx can alternatively function as a peroxidase and chaperone. The amino acid sequences of these two Prx proteins exhibit 93% homology, but PpPrx possesses an additional cysteine residue, Cys112, instead of the alanine found in PaPrx. PpPrx predominates with a high molecular weight (HMW) complex and chaperone activity, whereas PaPrx has mainly low molecular weight (LMW) structures and peroxidase activity. Mass spectrometry and structural analyses showed the involvement of Cys112 in the formation of an inter-disulfide bond, the instability of LMW structures, the formation of HMW complexes, and increased hydrophobicity leading to functional switching of Prx proteins between peroxidase and chaperone.

20969867|t|Leu628 of the KIX domain of CBP is a key residue for the interaction with the MLL transactivation domain.
20969867|t|Physical interaction between the transactivation domain (TAD) of the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) and the KIX domain of the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is necessary for MLL-mediated transcriptional activation. We show by alanine-scanning mutagenesis that hydrophobic surface residues of KIX, especially L628, are energetically important for binding the MLL TAD. NMR studies of the KIX-L628A mutant suggest that L628 plays a crucial role in conformational transitions at the MLL binding site, necessary for high affinity interactions with MLL. Unexpectedly, MLL also binds to the c-Myb/phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain of CREB (pKID) site of KIX, highlighting the complex nature of interactions involving intrinsically disordered transcriptional activators.

16282325|t|Distinct BIR domains of cIAP1 mediate binding to and ubiquitination of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 and second mitochondrial activator of caspases.
16282325|t|Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate apoptosis primarily by inhibiting caspase-family proteases. However, many IAPs also possess E3 ligase (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) activities implicated in both caspase-dependent and -independent functions of these proteins. Here, we compared the structural features of cIAP1 responsible for its interactions with two known target proteins, TRAF2 and SMAC. The N-terminal (BIR1) and C-terminal (BIR3) BIR domains of cIAP1 were determined to be necessary and sufficient for binding TRAF2 and SMAC, respectively. Mutational analysis of the BIR1 and BIR3 domains identified critical residues required for TRAF2 and SMAC binding. Using these mutants, cIAP1-mediated ubiquitination of TRAF2 and SMAC in vitro was determined to be correspondingly dependent on intact binding sites on BIR1 and BIR3. Because TRAF2 regulates NF-kappaB activation, the effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2-mediated induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity were studied using reporter gene assays. Expression of a fragment of cIAP1 encompassing the three BIR domains (but not full-length cIAP1) greatly enhanced TRAF2-induced increases in NF-kappaB activity, providing a convenient assay for monitoring BIR-dependent effects of cIAP1 on TRAF2 in cells. BIR1 mutants of the BIR1-3 fragment of cIAP1 that failed to bind TRAF2 lost the ability to modulate NF-kappaB activity, demonstrating a requirement for BIR1-mediated interactions with TRAF2. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the modularity and diversification of BIR domains, showing that a single cIAP can direct its E3 ligase activity toward different substrates and can alter the cellular functions of different protein targets in accordance with differences in the specificity of individual BIR domains.

12902344|t|Regulation of the discs large tumor suppressor by a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligase receptor.
12902344|t|The discs large (hDlg) tumor suppressor is intimately involved in the control of cell contact, polarity, and proliferation by interacting with several components of the epithelial junctional complex and with the APC tumor suppressor protein. In epithelial cells, hDlg protein stability is regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: hDlg is actively degraded in isolated cells, whereas it accumulates upon cell-cell contact. During neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells, loss of the differentiated morphology and progression toward a metastatic phenotype correlate with down-regulation of hDlg levels and loss of contact-dependent stabilization. Here we show that upon hyperphosphorylation, hDlg interacts with the beta-TrCP ubiquitin ligase receptor through a DSGLPS motif within its Src homology 3 domain. As a consequence, overexpression of beta-TrCP enhances ubiquitination of Dlg protein and decreases its stability, whereas a dominant negative beta-TrCP mutant inhibits this process. Furthermore, a mutant Dlg protein that is unable to bind beta-TrCP displays a higher protein stability and is insensitive to beta-TrCP. Using RNA interference, we also demonstrate that endogenous beta-TrCP regulates hDlg protein levels in epithelial cells. Finally, we show that beta-TrCP selectively induces the degradation of the membrane-cytoplasmic pool, without affecting the nuclear pool of hDlg.

24366945|t|Dimeric Ube2g2 simultaneously engages donor and acceptor ubiquitins to form Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains.
24366945|t|Cellular adaptation to proteotoxic stress at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on Lys48-linked polyubiquitination by ER-associated ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and subsequent elimination of ubiquitinated retrotranslocation products by the proteasome. The ER-associated E3 gp78 ubiquitinates misfolded proteins by transferring preformed Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains from the cognate E2 Ube2g2 to substrates. Here we demonstrate that Ube2g2 synthesizes linkage specific ubiquitin chains by forming an unprecedented homodimer: The dimerization of Ube2g2, mediated primarily by electrostatic interactions between two Ube2g2s, is also facilitated by the charged ubiquitin molecules. Mutagenesis studies show that Ube2g2 dimerization is required for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In addition to E2 dimerization, we show that a highly conserved arginine residue in the donor Ube2g2 senses the presence of an aspartate in the acceptor ubiquitin to position only Lys48 of ubiquitin in proximity to the donor E2 active site. These results reveal an unanticipated mode of E2 self-association that allows the E2 to effectively engage two ubiquitins to specifically synthesize Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains.

14519764|t|Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors bind to protein phosphatase 1C. Mapping and modeling of interacting sequences.
14519764|t|The modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by kinases and phosphatases represents a key mechanism in controlling synaptic signal transduction. However, molecular determinants involved in the specific targeting and interactions of these enzymes are largely unknown. Here, we identified both catalytic gamma-isoforms of protein phosphatase 1C (PP1gamma1 and PP1gamma2) as binding partners of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1a, 5a, and 5b in yeast cells and pull-down assays, using recombinant and native protein preparations. The tissue distribution of interacting proteins was compared, and protein phosphatase 1C was detected in dendrites of retinal bipolar cells expressing the respective interacting glutamate receptors. We mapped interacting domains within binding partners and identified five amino acids in the intracellular C termini of the metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1a, 5a, 5b, and 7b being both necessary and sufficient to bind protein phosphatase 1C. Furthermore, we show a dose-dependent competition of these C termini in binding the enzyme. Based on our data, we investigated the structure of the identified amino acids bound to protein phosphatase 1C by homology-based molecular modeling. In summary, these results provide a molecular description of the interaction between protein phosphatase 1C and metabotropic glutamate receptors and thereby increase our understanding of glutamatergic signal transduction.

17350650|t|Inhibition of human pancreatic ribonuclease by the human ribonuclease inhibitor protein.
17350650|t|The ribonuclease inhibitor protein (RI) binds to members of the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) superfamily with an affinity in the femtomolar range. Here, we report on structural and energetic aspects of the interaction between human RI (hRI) and human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1). The structure of the crystalline hRI x RNase 1 complex was determined at a resolution of 1.95 A, revealing the formation of 19 intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving 13 residues of RNase 1. In contrast, only nine such hydrogen bonds are apparent in the structure of the complex between porcine RI and RNase A. hRI, which is anionic, also appears to use its horseshoe-shaped structure to engender long-range Coulombic interactions with RNase 1, which is cationic. In accordance with the structural data, the hRI.RNase 1 complex was found to be extremely stable (t(1/2)=81 days; K(d)=2.9 x 10(-16) M). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments enabled the identification of two cationic residues in RNase 1, Arg39 and Arg91, that are especially important for both the formation and stability of the complex, and are thus termed "electrostatic targeting residues". Disturbing the electrostatic attraction between hRI and RNase 1 yielded a variant of RNase 1 that maintained ribonucleolytic activity and conformational stability but had a 2.8 x 10(3)-fold lower association rate for complex formation and 5.9 x 10(9)-fold lower affinity for hRI. This variant of RNase 1, which exhibits the largest decrease in RI affinity of any engineered ribonuclease, is also toxic to human erythroleukemia cells. Together, these results provide new insight into an unusual and important protein-protein interaction, and could expedite the development of human ribonucleases as chemotherapeutic agents.

22960107|t|Adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive K+ channel (Kir6.1): a novel phosphospecific interaction partner of connexin 43 (Cx43).
22960107|t|Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a phosphoprotein expressed in a wide variety of cells. Cx43 and adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive K(+)channels [K(+)(ATP)] are part of same signaling pathway that regulates cell survival during stress and ischemia preconditioning. Molecular mechanism for their coordinated role in ischemia/hypoxia preconditioning is not well known. Using pull down, co-immunoprecipitation assays and co-localization studies we provide evidence, for the first time that Kir6.1, a K(+)(ATP) channel protein component, can interact with Cx43. Further we show that the interaction was phospho-specific such that Cx43 phosphorylated at serine 262 (S262) interacted with Kir6.1 in preference to the unphosphorylated form of Cx43. Introduction of phospho-deficient mutation at serine 262 (S262A) in Cx43 completely abolished the interaction. Our data provide an interesting lead about a possible partnership between Cx43 and Kir6.1, which will help in better understanding their role in ischemia/hypoxia preconditioning.

20168298|t|A polycystin-2 (TRPP2) dimerization domain essential for the function of heteromeric polycystin complexes.
20168298|t|Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, which encode polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Earlier work has shown that PC1 and PC2 assemble into a polycystin complex implicated in kidney morphogenesis. PC2 also assembles into homomers of uncertain functional significance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that direct polycystin complex assembly and specify its functions. We have identified a coiled coil in the C-terminus of PC2 that functions as a homodimerization domain essential for PC1 binding but not for its self-oligomerization. Dimerization-defective PC2 mutants were unable to reconstitute PC1/PC2 complexes either at the plasma membrane (PM) or at PM-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions but could still function as ER Ca(2+)-release channels. Expression of dimerization-defective PC2 mutants in zebrafish resulted in a cystic phenotype but had lesser effects on organ laterality. We conclude that C-terminal dimerization of PC2 specifies the formation of polycystin complexes but not formation of ER-localized PC2 channels. Mutations that affect PC2 C-terminal homo- and heteromerization are the likely molecular basis of cyst formation in ADPKD.

17347647|t|Structural basis for ARF1-mediated recruitment of ARHGAP21 to Golgi membranes.
17347647|t|ARHGAP21 is a Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) that controls the Arp2/3 complex and F-actin dynamics at the Golgi complex by regulating the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42. ARHGAP21 is recruited to the Golgi by binding to another small GTPase, ARF1. Here, we present the crystal structure of the activated GTP-bound form of ARF1 in a complex with the Arf-binding domain (ArfBD) of ARHGAP21 at 2.1 A resolution. We show that ArfBD comprises a PH domain adjoining a C-terminal alpha helix, and that ARF1 interacts with both of these structural motifs through its switch regions and triggers structural rearrangement of the PH domain. We used site-directed mutagenesis to confirm that both the PH domain and the helical motif are essential for the binding of ArfBD to ARF1 and for its recruitment to the Golgi. Our data demonstrate that two well-known small GTPase-binding motifs, the PH domain and the alpha helical motif, can combine to create a novel mode of binding to Arfs.

8840966|t|A p18 mutant defective in CDK6 binding in human breast cancer cells.
8840966|t|Progression from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle is controlled by a family of low molecular weight cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. The importance of these proteins in cell growth control is underscored by the observation that some members of this family are deleted or mutated in human cancers. For example, the gene encoding the CDK inhibitor p18 is located on a segment of chromosome 1 that is often abnormal in human breast tumors. We have identified an alanine to proline substitution at codon 72 of the p18 gene in BT-20 human breast cancer cells. This mutation abrogates the ability of p18 to interact with CDK6 and renders p18 deficient in suppressing cell growth in a colony formation assay. Our results suggest that p18 inactivation by point mutations may contribute to deregulated growth control in certain cell lines and/or tumors.

20224574|t|A divalent FHA/BRCT-binding mechanism couples the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex to damaged chromatin.
20224574|t|The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex accumulates at sites of DNA double-strand breaks in large chromatin domains flanking the lesion site. The mechanism of MRN accumulation involves direct binding of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1) subunit to phosphorylated mediator of the DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), a large nuclear adaptor protein that interacts directly with phosphorylated H2AX. NBS1 contains an FHA domain and two BRCT domains at its amino terminus. Here, we show that both of these domains participate in the interaction with phosphorylated MDC1. Point mutations in key amino acid residues of either the FHA or the BRCT domains compromise the interaction with MDC1 and lead to defects in MRN accumulation at sites of DNA damage. Surprisingly, only mutation in the FHA domain, but not in the BRCT domains, yields a G2/M checkpoint defect, indicating that MDC1-dependent chromatin accumulation of the MRN complex at sites of DNA breaks is not required for G2/M checkpoint activation.

23178720|t|Dab1 stabilizes its interaction with Cin85 by suppressing Cin85 phosphorylation at serine 587.
23178720|t|Crk and CrkL adaptors play essential neuronal positioning roles downstream of Reelin-induced Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Recently we identified Cin85 to be a CrkL-SH3 binding partner from embryonic murine brain while others found Cin85 binds directly to Dab1. Here using mass spectrometry, biochemical and mutational analyses we show that Dab1 suppresses Cin85 phosphorylation at Ser587. Furthermore a Cin85 Ser587 phosphomimetic disrupts the Dab1-Cin85 complex without affecting the Cin85-CapZ complex. These data provide an early glimpse into how Cin85 phosphorylation might alter the composition of its scaffolding partners to regulate its diverse roles including vesicular trafficking, receptor endocytosis and actin remodeling.

11106648|t|Essential tyrosine residues for interaction of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B with N-cadherin.
11106648|t|Expression of a dominant-negative, catalytically inactive form of the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B in L-cells constitutively expressing N-cadherin results in loss of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. PTP1B interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin, and this association is regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PTP1B. The following three tyrosine residues in PTP1B are potential substrates for tyrosine kinases: Tyr-66, Tyr-152, and Tyr-153. To determine the tyrosine residue(s) that are crucial for the cadherin-PTP1B interaction we used site-directed mutagenesis to create catalytically inactive PTP1B constructs bearing additional single, double, or triple mutations in which tyrosine was substituted by phenylalanine. Mutation Y152F eliminates binding to N-cadherin in vitro, whereas mutations Y66F and Y153F do not. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive PTP1B with the Y152F mutation in L-cells constitutively expressing N-cadherin has no effect on N-cadherin-mediated adhesion, and immunoprecipitation reveals that the mutant Y152F PTP1B does not associate with N-cadherin in situ. Furthermore, among cells overexpressing the Y152F mutant endogenous PTP1B associates with N-cadherin and is tyrosine-phosphorylated.

12732628|t|Mechanistic studies of human molybdopterin synthase reaction and characterization of mutants identified in group B patients of molybdenum cofactor deficiency.
12732628|t|Biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor involves the initial formation of precursor Z, its subsequent conversion to molybdopterin (MPT) by MPT synthase, and attachment of molybdenum to the dithiolene moiety of MPT. The sulfur used for the formation of the dithiolene group of MPT exists in the form of a thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of the smaller subunit of MPT synthase. Human MPT synthase contains the MOCS2A and MOCS2B proteins that display homology to the Escherichia coli proteins MoaD and MoaE, respectively. MOCS2A and MOCS2B were purified after heterologous expression in E. coli, and the separately purified subunits readily assemble into a functional MPT synthase tetramer. The rate of conversion of precursor Z to MPT by the human enzyme is slower than that of the eubacterial homologue. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanism leading to human molybdenum cofactor deficiency, site-specific mutations identified in patients showing symptoms of molybdenum cofactor deficiency were generated. Characterization of a V7F substitution in MOCS2A, identified in a patient with an unusual mild form of the disease, showed that the mutation weakens the interaction between MOCS2A and MOCS2B, whereas a MOCS2B-E168K mutation identified in a severely affected patient attenuates binding of precursor Z.

12527904|t|Interaction between BRCA2 and replication protein A is compromised by a cancer-predisposing mutation in BRCA2.
12527904|t|Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to familial, early-onset breast cancer. Both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins appear to function in the homologous recombination pathway of DNA double-strand break repair. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in transcription by RNA polymerase II, for both proteins have domains which, when tethered adjacent to a promoter, can activate transcription. In experiments reported here, we have used protein affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation techniques to show that the putative N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain of BRCA2 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a protein essential for DNA repair, replication and recombination. This interaction was not mediated by DNA and was specific for human RPA but not yeast RPA. Since the cancer-predisposing mutation Y42C in BRCA2 significantly compromised the interaction between RPA and BRCA2, this interaction may be biologically important. That BRCA2 protein in HeLa cell extract also coimmunoprecipitated with RPA suggested that this interaction occurs in vivo. Therefore, the transcriptional activation domains within BRCA2, and perhaps BRCA1, may provide links to RPA and DNA repair processes rather than transcription.

9012831|t|BAP-135, a target for Bruton's tyrosine kinase in response to B cell receptor engagement.
9012831|t|Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is essential for B cell activation, but downstream targets of Btk have not been defined. We now describe a protein, BAP-135, that is associated with Btk in B cells and is a substrate for phosphorylation by Btk. BAP-135, which exhibits no detectable homology to known proteins, contains six occurrences of a hitherto undescribed amino acid repeat and two motifs, similar to the Src autophosphorylation site, that represent potential targets for tyrosine phosphorylation. The pleckstrin homology domain of Btk comprises the principal site of BAP-135 binding. Btk-dependent phosphorylation of BAP-135 is abolished by mutations that impair activation of Btk by Src-related kinases. Btk and BAP-135 exist in a complex before B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement; in response to BCR crosslinking, BAP-135 is transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine. Taken together, these observations suggest that BAP-135 may reside downstream of Btk in a signaling pathway originating at the BCR.

14675752|t|Characterization of a gamma-adaptin ear-binding motif in enthoprotin.
14675752|t|Enthoprotin, a newly identified component of clathrin-coated vesicles, interacts with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) clathrin adapters AP-1 and GGA2. Here we perform a multi-faceted analysis of the site in enthoprotin that is responsible for the binding to the gamma-adaptin ear (gamma-ear) domain of AP-1. Alanine scan mutagenesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies reveal the full extent of the site as well as critical residues for this interaction. NMR studies of the gamma-ear in complex with a synthetic peptide from enthoprotin provide structural details of the binding site for TGN accessory proteins within the gamma-ear.

22904282|t|Interaction of CarD with RNA polymerase mediates Mycobacterium tuberculosis viability, rifampin resistance, and pathogenesis.
22904282|t|Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection continues to cause substantial human suffering. New chemotherapeutic strategies, which require insight into the pathways essential for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis, are imperative. We previously reported that depletion of the CarD protein in mycobacteria compromises viability, resistance to oxidative stress and fluoroquinolones, and pathogenesis. CarD associates with the RNA polymerase (RNAP), but it has been unknown which of the diverse functions of CarD are mediated through the RNAP; this question must be answered to understand the CarD mechanism of action. Herein, we describe the interaction between the M. tuberculosis CarD and the RNAP b subunit and identify point mutations that weaken this interaction. The characterization of mycobacterial strains with attenuated CarD/RNAP b interactions demonstrates that the CarD/RNAP b association is required for viability and resistance to oxidative stress but not for fluoroquinolone resistance. Weakening the CarD/RNAP b interaction also increases the sensitivity of mycobacteria to rifampin and streptomycin. Surprisingly, depletion of the CarD protein did not affect sensitivity to rifampin. These findings define the CarD/RNAP interaction as a new target for chemotherapeutic intervention that could also improve the efficacy of rifampin treatment of tuberculosis. In addition, our data demonstrate that weakening the CarD/RNAP b interaction does not completely phenocopy the depletion of CarD and support the existence of functions for CarD independent of direct RNAP binding.

22354040|t|RPA facilitates telomerase activity at chromosome ends in budding and fission yeasts.
22354040|t|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase complex binds to chromosome ends and is activated in late S-phase through a process coupled to the progression of the replication fork. Here, we show that the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (replication protein A) binds to the two daughter telomeres during telomere replication but only its binding to the leading-strand telomere depends on the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 (MRX) complex. We further demonstrate that RPA specifically co-precipitates with yKu, Cdc13 and telomerase. The interaction of RPA with telomerase appears to be mediated by both yKu and the telomerase subunit Est1. Moreover, a mutation in Rfa1 that affects both the interaction with yKu and telomerase reduces the dramatic increase in telomere length of a rif1/\, rif2/\ double mutant. Finally, we show that the RPA/telomerase association and function are conserved in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our results indicate that in both yeasts, RPA directly facilitates telomerase activity at chromosome ends.

25600339|t|Tunable-combinatorial mechanisms of acquired resistance limit the efficacy of BRAF/MEK cotargeting but result in melanoma drug addiction.
25600339|t|Combined BRAF- and MEK-targeted therapy improves upon BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy but is still beset by acquired resistance. We show that melanomas acquire resistance to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition by augmenting or combining mechanisms of single-agent BRAFi resistance. These double-drug resistance-associated genetic configurations significantly altered molecular interactions underlying MAPK pathway reactivation. (V600E)BRAF, expressed at supraphysiological levels because of (V600E)BRAF ultra-amplification, dimerized with and activated CRAF. In addition, MEK mutants enhanced interaction with overexpressed (V600E)BRAF via a regulatory interface at R662 of (V600E)BRAF. Importantly, melanoma cell lines selected for resistance to BRAFi+MEKi, but not those to BRAFi alone, displayed robust drug addiction, providing a potentially exploitable therapeutic opportunity.

16014621|t|The plastid division protein AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-ATPase stimulated by AtMinE1.
16014621|t|Bacteria and plastids divide symmetrically through binary fission by accurately placing the division site at midpoint, a process initiated by FtsZ polymerization, which forms a Z-ring. In Escherichia coli precise Z-ring placement at midcell depends on controlled oscillatory behavior of MinD and MinE: In the presence of ATP MinD interacts with the FtsZ inhibitor MinC and migrates to the membrane where the MinD-MinC complex recruits MinE, followed by MinD-mediated ATP hydrolysis and membrane release. Although correct Z-ring placement during Arabidopsis plastid division depends on the precise localization of the bacterial homologs AtMinD1 and AtMinE1, the underlying mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here we have shown that AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase and through mutation analysis demonstrated the physiological importance of this activity where loss of ATP hydrolysis results in protein mislocalization within plastids. The observed mislocalization is not due to disrupted AtMinD1 dimerization, however; the active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant is unable to interact with the topological specificity factor AtMinE1. We have shown that AtMinE1, but not E. coli MinE, stimulates AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis, but in contrast to prokaryotes stimulation occurs in the absence of membrane lipids. Although AtMinD1 appears highly evolutionarily conserved, we found that important biochemical and cell biological properties have diverged. We propose that correct intraplastidic AtMinD1 localization is dependent on AtMinE1-stimulated, Ca2+-dependent AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis, ultimately ensuring precise Z-ring placement and symmetric plastid division.

15226396|t|Continuous association of cadherin with beta-catenin requires the non-receptor tyrosine-kinase Fer.
15226396|t|The function of Type 1, classic cadherins depends on their association with the actin cytoskeleton, a connection mediated by alpha- and beta-catenin. The phosphorylation state of beta-catenin is crucial for its association with cadherin and thus the association of cadherin with the cytoskeleton. We now show that the phosphorylation of beta-catenin is regulated by the combined activities of the tyrosine kinase Fer and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B. Fer phosphorylates PTP1B at tyrosine 152, regulating its binding to cadherin and the continuous dephosphorylation of beta-catenin at tyrosine 654. Fer interacts with cadherin indirectly, through p120ctn. We have mapped the interaction domains of Fer and p120ctn and peptides corresponding to these sequences release Fer from p120ctn in vitro and in live cells, resulting in loss of cadherin-associated PTP1B, an increase in the pool of tyrosine phosphorylated beta-catenin and loss of cadherin adhesion function. The effect of the peptides is lost when a beta-catenin mutant with a substitution at tyrosine 654 is introduced into cells. Thus, Fer phosphorylates PTP1B at tyrosine 152 enabling it to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin, where it maintains beta-catenin in a dephosphorylated state. Cultured fibroblasts from mouse embryos targeted with a kinase-inactivating ferD743R mutation have lost cadherin-associated PTP1B and beta-catenin, as well as localization of cadherin and beta-catenin in areas of cell-cell contacts. Expression of wild-type Fer or culture in epidermal growth factor restores the cadherin complex and localization at cell-cell contacts.

17377852|t|Identification of TCP10L as primate-specific gene derived via segmental duplication and homodimerization of TCP10L through the leucine zipper motif.
17377852|t|TCP10L, a transcriptional repression factor gene that was localized on human chromosome 21q22.11, was identified to be derived through segmental duplication since the divergence of primates and rodents. It was elucidated that TCP10L gene was a primate-specific gene in this study. Subsequently it was demonstrated that the putative leucine zipper motif mediated the homodimerization of TCP10L. Using in vitro and in vivo methodologies, it was shown that either deletion or point mutation of the leucine zipper motif was sufficient to abolish TCP10L homodimerization. In Hela cells, both the exogenous wild type TCP10L and endogenous TCP10L were detected on nuclei with immunofluorescence assay. However, the leucine zipper motif mutants of TCP10L could also be detected on nuclei. The results suggested that the leucine zipper motif enabled TCP10L to homodimerize, but was not essential for the TCP10L nuclear localization.

11697903|t|Specific interaction of the potassium channel beta-subunit minK with the sarcomeric protein T-cap suggests a T-tubule-myofibril linking system.
11697903|t|Ion-channel beta-subunits are ancillary proteins that co-assemble with alpha-subunits to modulate gating kinetics and enhance stability of multimeric channel complexes. They provide binding sites for other regulatory proteins and are medically important as the targets of many pharmacological compounds. MinK is the beta-subunit of the slow activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)) channel, and associates with the alpha-subunit, KvLQT1. We report here that minK specifically interacts with the sarcomeric Z-line component, T-cap (also called telethonin). In vitro interaction studies indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of minK specifically binds to the sixteen C-terminal residues of T-cap; these residues are sufficient for its interaction with minK. Consistent with our in vitro studies, immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal analysis revealed that both minK and T-cap are localized within the Z-line region in cardiac muscle. Striated staining of minK was observed in non-washed, membrane-intact cardiac myofibrils, but not in well-washed, membrane-removed cardiac myofibrils, suggesting that minK localizes on T-tubular membranes surrounding the Z-line in the inner ventricular myocardium. Together with our previous data on the colocalization and interaction of T-cap with the N-terminus of the giant protein titin in the periphery of the Z-line, these data suggest that T-cap functions as an adapter protein to link together myofibrillar components with the membranous beta-subunit of the I(Ks) channel. We speculate that this interaction may contribute to a stretch-dependent regulation of potassium flux in cardiac muscle, providing a "mechano-electrical feedback" system.

20840750|t|Identification of two amino acids in the C-terminal domain of mouse CRY2 essential for PER2 interaction.
20840750|t|BACKGROUND: Cryptochromes (CRYs) are a class of flavoprotein blue-light signaling receptors found in plants and animals, and they control plant development and the entrainment of circadian rhythms. They also act as integral parts of the central circadian oscillator in humans and other animals. In mammals, the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer activates transcription of the Per and Cry genes as well as clock-regulated genes. The PER2 proteins interact with CRY and CKI  , and the resulting ternary complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they negatively regulate the transcription of Per and Cry core clock genes and other clock-regulated output genes. Recent studies have indicated that the extended C-termini of the mammalian CRYs, as compared to photolyase proteins, interact with PER proteins. RESULTS: We identified a region on mCRY2 (between residues 493 and 512) responsible for direct physical interaction with mPER2 by mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Moreover, using oligonucleotide-based degenerate PCR, we discovered that mutation of Arg-501 and Lys-503 of mCRY2 within this C-terminal region totally abolishes interaction with PER2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify mCRY2 amino acid residues that interact with the mPER2 binding region and suggest the potential for rational drug design to inhibit CRYs for specific therapeutic approaches.

22878415|t|Ubiquitin-specific protease-like 1 (USPL1) is a SUMO isopeptidase with essential, non-catalytic functions.
22878415|t|Isopeptidases are essential regulators of protein ubiquitination and sumoylation. However, only two families of SUMO isopeptidases are at present known. Here, we report an activity-based search with the suicide inhibitor haemagglutinin (HA)-SUMO-vinylmethylester that led to the identification of a surprising new SUMO protease, ubiquitin-specific protease-like 1 (USPL1). Indeed, USPL1 neither binds nor cleaves ubiquitin, but is a potent SUMO isopeptidase both in vitro and in cells. C13orf22l--an essential but distant zebrafish homologue of USPL1--also acts on SUMO, indicating functional conservation. We have identified invariant USPL1 residues required for SUMO binding and cleavage. USPL1 is a low-abundance protein that colocalizes with coilin in Cajal bodies. Its depletion does not affect global sumoylation, but causes striking coilin mislocalization and impairs cell proliferation, functions that are not dependent on USPL1 catalytic activity. Thus, USPL1 represents a third type of SUMO protease, with essential functions in Cajal body biology.

19176810|t|The Parkinson disease protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 transduces death signals via Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase-8 in a cellular model of neurodegeneration.
19176810|t|Neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson and Alzheimer disease are an increasingly prevalent problem in aging societies, yet no therapies exist that retard or prevent neurodegeneration. Dominant missense mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD), but the mechanisms by which mutant forms of LRRK2 disrupt neuronal function and cause cell death remain poorly understood. We report that LRRK2 interacts with the death adaptor Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and that in primary neuronal culture LRRK2-mediated neurodegeneration is prevented by the functional inhibition of FADD or depletion of caspase-8, two key elements of the extrinsic cell death pathway. This pathway is activated by disease-triggering mutations, which enhance the LRRK2-FADD association and the consequent recruitment and activation of caspase-8. These results establish a direct molecular link between a mutant PD gene and the activation of programmed cell death signaling, and suggest that FADD/caspase-8 signaling contributes to LRRK2-induced neuronal death.

11971877|t|Mutations in CD2BP1 disrupt binding to PTP PEST and are responsible for PAPA syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder.
11971877|t|PAPA syndrome (pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne, OMIM #604416) and familial recurrent arthritis (FRA) are rare inherited disorders of early onset, primarily affecting skin and joint tissues. Recurring inflammatory episodes lead to accumulation of sterile, pyogenic, neutrophil-rich material within the affected joints, ultimately resulting in significant destruction. We recently localized the genes for PAPA syndrome and FRA to chromosome 15q and suggested that they are the same disorder. We have now established this by the identification of co-segregating disease-causing mutations in the CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1; GenBank accession no XM 044569) gene in the two reported families with this disorder. E250Q or A230T amino acid substitutions occur within a domain highly homologous to yeast cleavage furrow-associated protein CDC15. CD2BP1 and its murine ortholog, proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PSTPIP1), are adaptor proteins known to interact with PEST-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrate severely reduced binding between PTP PEST and both the E250Q and A230T mutant proteins. Previous evidence supports the integral role of CD2BP1 and its interacting proteins in actin reorganization during cytoskeletal-mediated events. We hypothesize that the disease-causing mutations that we have identified compromise physiologic signaling necessary for the maintenance of proper inflammatory response. Accordingly we suggest classification of PAPA syndrome as an autoinflammatory disease. This CD2BP1-mediated biochemical pathway(s) may function in common inflammatory disorders with apparent etiological overlap, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

20953186|t|Common variants at TRAF3IP2 are associated with susceptibility to psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.
20953186|t|Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease that is distinct from other chronic arthritides and which is frequently accompanied by psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) and seronegativity for rheumatoid factor. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 609 German individuals with PsA (cases) and 990 controls with replication in 6 European cohorts including a total of 5,488 individuals. We replicated PsA associations at HLA-C and IL12B and identified a new association at TRAF3IP2 (rs13190932, P = 8.56 * 10        ). TRAF3IP2 was also associated with PsV in a German cohort including 2,040 individuals (rs13190932, P = 1.95 * 10     ). Sequencing of the exons of TRAF3IP2 identified a coding variant (p.Asp10Asn, rs33980500) as the most significantly associated SNP (P = 1.13 * 10        , odds ratio = 1.95). Functional assays showed reduced binding of this TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6, suggesting altered modulation of immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a new and shared pathway for PsA and PsV.

17540175|t|Binding of ras to phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110alpha is required for ras-driven tumorigenesis in mice.
17540175|t|Ras proteins signal through direct interaction with a number of effector enzymes, including type I phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases. Although the ability of Ras to control PI 3-kinase has been well established in manipulated cell culture models, evidence for a role of the interaction of endogenous Ras with PI 3-kinase in normal and malignant cell growth in vivo has been lacking. Here we generate mice with mutations in the Pi3kca gene encoding the catalytic p110alpha isoform that block its interaction with Ras. Cells from these mice show proliferative defects and selective disruption of signaling from growth factors to PI 3-kinase. The mice display defective development of the lymphatic vasculature, resulting in perinatal appearance of chylous ascites. Most importantly, they are highly resistant to endogenous Ras oncogene-induced tumorigenesis. The interaction of Ras with p110alpha is thus required in vivo for certain normal growth factor signaling and for Ras-driven tumor formation.

16630557|t|The decapping enzyme Dcp1 participates in translation termination through its interaction with the release factor eRF3 in budding yeast.
16630557|t|One of the rate-limiting steps in messenger RNA decay pathway is the 5'-cap cleavage of mRNAs, decapping reaction, which is conducted by the protein complex of Dcp1 and Dcp2. We find here that Dcp1p can interact with the release factor eRF3p (Sup35p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Knockout of DCP1 caused not only the accumulation of nonsense mRNAs possibly due to the impaired decapping activity but also the enhancement of the read-through of nonsense codon. To examine the relationship between the two DCP1-knockout phenotypes, we produced DCP1 point mutants that lack the ability to support the translation termination. Interestingly, decapping activity of Dcp1p was still intact, but its interaction with eRF3p was abolished in the DCP1 mutants, indicating that the two functions originated from different entities of Dcp1p. These results suggest that the decapping enzyme Dcp1p may have an additional role in the translation termination through its interaction with eRF3p.

21850687|t|Mutations in LRRK2 increase phosphorylation of peroxiredoxin 3 exacerbating oxidative stress-induced neuronal death.
21850687|t|Mutations in the leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are responsible for autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson disease (PD), possibly exerting their effects via a toxic gain of function. A common p.G2019S mutation (rs34637584:A>G) is responsible for up to 30-40% of PD cases in some ethnic populations. Here, we show that LRRK2 interacts with human peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), a mitochondrial member of the antioxidant family of thioredoxin (Trx) peroxidases. Importantly, mutations in the LRRK2 kinase domain significantly increased phosphorylation of PRDX3 compared to wild-type. The increase in PRDX3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased peroxidase activity and increased death in LRRK2-expressing but not in LRRK2-depleted or vector-transfected neuronal cells. LRRK2 mutants stimulated mitochondrial factors involved in apoptosis and induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative modification of macromolecules. Furthermore, immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem human PD patients carrying the p.G2019S mutation showed a marked increase in phosphorylated PRDX3 (p-PRDX3) relative to normal brain. We showed that LRRK2 mutations increase the inhibition of an endogenous peroxidase by phosphorylation promoting dysregulation of mitochondrial function and oxidative damage. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between the enhanced kinase activity of PD-linked LRRK2 and neuronal cell death.

10444103|t|Determination of the motif responsible for interaction between the rice APETALA1/AGAMOUS-LIKE9 family proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system.
10444103|t|A MADS family gene, OsMADS6, was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) young flower cDNA library using OsAMDS1 as a probe. With this clone, various MADS box genes that encode for protein-to-protein interaction partners of the OsMADS6 protein were isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screening method. On the basis of sequence homology, OsMADS6 and the selected partners can be classified in the APETALA1/AGAMOUS-LIKE9 (AP1/AGL9) family. One of the interaction partners, OsMADS14, was selected for further study. Both genes began expression at early stages of flower development, and their expression was extended into the later stages. In mature flowers the OsMADS6 transcript was detectable in lodicules and also weakly in sterile lemmas and carpels, whereas the OsMADS14 transcript was detectable in sterile lemmas, paleas/lemmas, stamens, and carpels. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that the region containing of the 109th to 137th amino acid residues of OsMADS6 is indispensable in the interaction with OsMADS14. Site-directed mutation analysis revealed that the four periodical leucine residues within the region are essential for this interaction. Furthermore, it was shown that the 14 amino acid residues located immediately downstream of the K domain enhance the interaction, and that the two leucine residues within this region play an important role in that enhancement.

15831486|t|Dok-R mediates attenuation of epidermal growth factor-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt activation through processive recruitment of c-Src and Csk.
15831486|t|Dok-R has previously been shown to associate with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. The recruitment of Dok-R to the EGFR, which is mediated through its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, results in attenuation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. Dok-R's ability to attenuate EGF-driven MAPK activation is independent of its ability to recruit rasGAP, a known attenuator of MAPK activity, suggesting an alternate Dok-R-mediated pathway. Herein, we have determined the structural determinants within Dok-R that are required for its ability to attenuate EGF signaling and to associate with c-Src and with the Src family kinase (SFK)-inhibitory kinase, Csk. We demonstrate that Dok-R associates constitutively with c-Src through an SH3-dependent interaction and that this association is essential to Dok-R's ability to attenuate c-Src activity and diminish MAPK and Akt/PKB activity. We further illustrate that EGF-dependent phosphorylation of Dok-R requires SFK activity and, more specifically, that SFK-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine 402 on Dok-R facilitates the inducible recruitment of Csk. We propose that recruitment of Csk to Dok-R serves to bring Csk to c-Src and down-regulate its activity, resulting in a concomitant attenuation of MAPK and Akt/PKB activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Dok-R can abrogate c-Src's ability to protect the breast cancer cell line SKBR3 from anoikis and that an association with c-Src and Csk is required for this activity. Collectively these results demonstrate that Dok-R acts as an EGFR-recruited scaffolding molecule that processively assembles c-Src and Csk to attenuate signaling from the EGFR.

19716822|t|Phosphorylation of the Arabidopsis AtrbohF NADPH oxidase by OST1 protein kinase.
19716822|t|The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) triggers production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells via the AtrbohD and AtrbohF NADPH oxidases, leading to stomatal closure. The ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinase open stomata 1 (OST1) (SRK2E/SnRK2.6) acts upstream of ROS in guard cell ABA signaling. Here, we report that OST1 phosphorylates Ser13 and Ser174 on AtrbohF. In addition, substitution of Ser174 to Ala results in a approximately 40% reduction in the phosphorylation of AtrbohF by OST1. We also show that OST1 physically interacts with AtrbohF. These results provide biochemical evidence suggesting that OST1 regulates AtrbohF activity.

15254196|t|p53 targets simian virus 40 large T antigen for acetylation by CBP.
15254196|t|Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (T Ag) interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 and the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Binding of these cellular proteins in a ternary complex has been implicated in T Ag-mediated transformation. It has been suggested that the ability of CBP/p300 to modulate p53 function underlies p53's regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In this study, we provide further evidence that CBP activity may be mediated through its synergistic action with p53. We demonstrate that SV40 T Ag is acetylated in vivo in a p53-dependent manner and T Ag acetylation is largely mediated by CBP. The acetylation of T Ag is dependent on its interaction with p53 and on p53's interaction with CBP. We have mapped the site of acetylation on T Ag to the C-terminal lysine residue 697. This acetylation site is conserved between the T antigens of the human polyomaviruses JC and BK, which are also known to interact with p53. We show that both JC and BK T antigens are also acetylated at corresponding sites in vivo. While other proteins are known to be acetylated by CBP/p300, none are known to depend on p53 for acetylation. T Ag acetylation may provide a regulatory mechanism for T Ag binding to a cellular factor or play a role in another aspect of T Ag function.

22491013|t|Disabled-2 (Dab2) inhibits Wnt/b-catenin signalling by binding LRP6 and promoting its internalization through clathrin.
22491013|t|Canonical Wnt signalling requires caveolin-dependent internalization of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Here we report that the tumour suppressor and endocytic adaptor disabled-2 (Dab2), previously described as an inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin signalling, selectively recruits LRP6 to the clathrin-dependent endocytic route, thereby sequestering it from caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Wnt stimulation induces the casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent phosphorylation of LRP6 at S1579, promoting its binding to Dab2 and internalization with clathrin. LRP6 receptor mutant (S1579A), deficient in CK2-mediated phosphorylation and Dab2 binding, fails to associate with clathrin, and thus escapes the inhibitory effects of Dab2 on Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Our data suggest that the S1579 site of LRP6 is a negative regulatory point during LRP6-mediated dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish and in allograft mouse tumour models. We conclude that the tumour suppressor functions of Dab2 involve modulation of canonical Wnt signalling by regulating the endocytic fate of the LRP6 receptor.

15485833|t|ARPC1/Arc40 mediates the interaction of the actin-related protein 2 and 3 complex with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family activators.
15485833|t|The actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is a seven-subunit protein complex that nucleates actin filaments at the cell cortex. Despite extensive cross-linking, crystallography, genetic and biochemical studies, the contribution of each subunit to the activity of the complex remains largely unclear. In this study we characterized the function of the 40-kDa subunit, ARPC1/Arc40, of the yeast Arp2/3 complex. We showed that this subunit is indeed a stable component of the Arp2/3 complex, but its highly unusual electrophoretic mobility eluded detection in previous studies. Recombinant Arc40 bound the VCA domain of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family activators at a K(d) of 0.45 mum, close to that of the full complex with VCA (0.30 microm), and this interaction was dependent on the conserved tryptophan at the COOH terminus of VCA. Using a newly constructed Delta arc40 yeast strain, we showed that loss of Arc40 severely reduced the binding affinity of the Arp2/3 complex with VCA as well as the nucleation activity of the complex, suggesting that Arc40 contains an important contact site of the Arp2/3 complex with VCA. The Delta arc40 cells exhibited reduced growth rate, loss of actin patches, and accumulation of cables like actin aggregates, phenotypes typical of other subunit nulls, suggesting that Arc40 functions exclusively within the Arp2/3 complex.

24412932|t|c-Abl phosphorylates a-synuclein and regulates its degradation: implication for a-synuclein clearance and contribution to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
24412932|t|Increasing evidence suggests that the c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase could play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. c-Abl has been shown to regulate the degradation of two proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of PD, parkin and a-synuclein (a-syn). The inhibition of parkin's neuroprotective functions is regulated by c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of parkin. However, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Abl activity regulates a-syn toxicity and clearance remain unknown. Herein, using NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, in vitro enzymatic assays and cell-based studies, we established that a-syn is a bona fide substrate for c-Abl. In vitro studies demonstrate that c-Abl directly interacts with a-syn and catalyzes its phosphorylation mainly at tyrosine 39 (pY39) and to a lesser extent at tyrosine 125 (pY125). Analysis of human brain tissues showed that pY39 a-syn is detected in the brains of healthy individuals and those with PD. However, only c-Abl protein levels were found to be upregulated in PD brains. Interestingly, nilotinib, a specific inhibitor of c-Abl kinase activity, induces a-syn protein degradation via the autophagy and proteasome pathways, whereas the overexpression of a-syn in the rat midbrains enhances c-Abl expression. Together, these data suggest that changes in c-Abl expression, activation and/or c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Y39 play a role in regulating a-syn clearance and contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.

11402167|t|Molecular characterization of functional domains in the protein kinase SOS2 that is required for plant salt tolerance.
11402167|t|The SOS3 (for SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE3) calcium binding protein and SOS2 protein kinase are required for sodium and potassium ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. We have shown previously that SOS3 interacts with and activates the SOS2 protein kinase. We report here the identification of a SOS3 binding motif in SOS2 that also serves as the kinase autoinhibitory domain. Yeast two-hybrid assays as well as in vitro binding assays revealed a 21-amino acid motif in the regulatory domain of SOS2 that is necessary and sufficient for interaction with SOS3. Database searches revealed a large family of SOS2-like protein kinases containing such a SOS3 binding motif. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we show that these SOS2-like kinases interact with members of the SOS3 family of calcium binding proteins. Two-hybrid assays also revealed interaction between the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain within SOS2, suggesting that the regulatory domain may inhibit kinase activity by blocking substrate access to the catalytic site. Removal of the regulatory domain of SOS2, including the SOS3 binding motif, resulted in constitutive activation of the protein kinase, indicating that the SOS3 binding motif can serve as a kinase autoinhibitory domain. Constitutively active SOS2 that is SOS3 independent also was produced by changing Thr(168) to Asp in the activation loop of the SOS2 kinase domain. Combining the Thr(168)-to-Asp mutation with the autoinhibitory domain deletion created a superactive SOS2 kinase. These results provide insights into regulation of the kinase activities of SOS2 and the SOS2 family of protein kinases.

21658387|t|LRRK2 directly phosphorylates Akt1 as a possible physiological substrate: impairment of the kinase activity by Parkinson's disease-associated mutations.
21658387|t|LRRK2 is the causal molecule for autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease, although its true function, including its physiological substrates, remains unknown. Here, using in vitro kinase assay with recombinant proteins, we demonstrated for the first time that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates Akt1, a central molecule involved in signal transduction for cell survival and prevention of apoptosis. Ser473, one of two amino acids essential for Akt1 activation, was the target site for LRRK2. A knockdown experiment using intact cells also demonstrated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt1 (Ser473), suggesting that Akt1 is a convincing candidate for the physiological substrate of LRRK2. The disease-associated mutations, R1441C, G2019S, and I2020T, exhibited reduced interaction with, and phosphorylation of, Akt1, suggesting one possible mechanism for the neurodegeneration caused by LRRK2 mutations.

9422760|t|Identification of a novel polyproline recognition site in the cytoskeletal associated protein, proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein.
9422760|t|Protein-protein interactions are often mediated by the recognition of proline-rich domains by SH3 or WW modules. Previously, we demonstrated that the PEST-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTP HSCF (hematopoietic stem cell fraction), bound to a novel cytoskeletal associated protein, proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein (PST PIP), via an interaction between the proline-rich COOH terminus of the PTP and a site within the putative coiled-coil domain of PST PIP. Here we describe a more detailed analysis of this interaction. Earlier data suggested that the NH2 terminus of PST PIP was important for binding to the phosphatase, and deletion of the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids of the PST PIP resulted in an apparently misfolded protein that was incapable of binding PTP HSCF. To examine the region involved with binding to PTP HSCF, alanine-scanning mutants were produced at intervals throughout PST PIP. This analysis demonstrated that a tryptophan at position 232 was essential for binding in vitro. Transfection experiments demonstrated that the Trp232 mutant protein was capable of association with the cortical cytoskeleton but was not bound to PTP HSCF in vivo. Alanine scanning of a peptide derived from the COOH-terminal proline-rich domain of PTP HSCF revealed that a subset of prolines, as well as other residues, was required for efficient binding to PST PIP, and introduction of alanines at some of these positions in the protein resulted in decreased binding to PST PIP in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of the Trp232 mutant of PST PIP in the presence of v-Src revealed that this protein was phosphorylated more efficiently than the wild-type molecule. Thus, the interaction between PTP HSCF and PST PIP is mediated by a novel site in the cytoskeletal associated protein which interacts with residues within the proline-rich COOH terminus of the phosphatase.

12670962|t|Subunit oligomerization and substrate recognition of the Escherichia coli ClpYQ (HslUV) protease implicated by in vivo protein-protein interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system.
12670962|t|The Escherichia coli ClpYQ (HslUV) is an ATP-dependent protease that consists of an ATPase large subunit with homology to other Clp family ATPases and a peptidase small subunit related to the proteasomal beta-subunits of eukaryotes. Six identical subunits of both ClpY and ClpQ self-assemble into an oligomeric ring, and two rings of each subunit, two ClpQ rings surrounded by single ClpY rings, form a dumbbell shape complex. The ClpYQ protease degrades the cell division inhibitor, SulA, and a positive regulator of capsule transcription, RcsA, as well as RpoH, a heat shock sigma transcription factor. Using the yeast-two hybrid system, we explored the in vivo protein-protein interactions of the individual subunits of the ClpYQ protease involved in self-oligomerization, as well as in recognition of specific substrates. Interactions were detected with ClpQ/ClpQ, ClpQ/ClpY, and ClpY/SulA. No interactions were observed in experiments with ClpY/ClpY, ClpQ/RcsA, and ClpQ/SulA. However, ClpY, lacking domain I (ClpY(Delta I)) was able to interact with itself and with intact ClpY. The C-terminal region of ClpY is important for interaction with other ClpY subunits. The previously defined PDZ-like domains at the C terminus of ClpY, including both D1 and D2, were determined to be indispensable for substrate binding. Various deletion and random point mutants of SulA were also made to verify significant interactions with ClpY. Thus, we demonstrated in vivo hetero- and homointeractions of ClpQ and ClpY molecules, as well as a direct association between ClpY and substrate SulA, thereby supporting previous in vitro biochemical findings.

14715275|t|Rpp20 interacts with SMN and is re-distributed into SMN granules in response to stress.
14715275|t|Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene. To investigate SMN functions, we undertook the yeast two-hybrid screens and identified Drosophila Rpp20, a subunit of the RNase P and RNase MRP holoenzymes, to interact with the Drosophila SMN protein. Interaction between human SMN and Rpp20 was validated by in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation. The exons 3-4 of SMN are necessary and sufficient for binding to Rpp20. Binding efficiency between Rpp20 and SMNs with mutations in the Y-G domain is abrogated or reduced and correlated with severity of SMA disease. Immunofluorescence results indicate that Rpp20 is diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm with higher concentration observed in the nucleus. However, in response to stress, SMN forms aggregates and redistributes Rpp20 into punctuated cytoplasmic SMN granules. Our findings suggest a possible functional association of SMN with RNase P and RNase MRP complexes.

11799244|t|Requirement of a macromolecular signaling complex for beta adrenergic receptor modulation of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 potassium channel.
11799244|t|Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulation of cardiac action potential duration (APD) is mediated by beta adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation, which increases the slow outward potassium ion current (IKS). Mutations in two human I(KS) channel subunits, hKCNQ1 and hKCNE1, prolong APD and cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias known as LQTS (long QT syndrome). We show that betaAR modulation of I(KS) requires targeting of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to hKCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao. Yotiao binds to hKCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for SNS modulation of cardiac APD through IKS.

17047026|t|Non-invasive genetic diagnosis of male infertility using spermatozoal RNA: KLHL10 mutations in oligozoospermic patients impair homodimerization.
17047026|t|Infertility affects an estimated 7% of men worldwide, nearly a quarter of whom are diagnosed as idiopathic. The genetic etiologies of idiopathic male infertility are unknown, partly due to lack of simple diagnostic techniques. Moreover, the transmission risk of such genetic defects to offspring born from assisted reproductive techniques is increasingly becoming a concern for physicians and infertile couples. We explored the feasibility of obtaining full-length mRNAs from transcriptionally inert human spermatozoa in semen as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for identifying germline mutations in candidate infertility-associated genes. The efficacy of reverse-transcription PCR on spermatozoal RNA from infertile patients with wide-ranging sperm concentrations varied between 91 and 99% for multiple haploid germ cell-expressed genes. Using this methodology, we identified seven oligozoospermic patients with missense and splicing mutations in the germ cell-specific gene, KLHL10. Three of 270 (1.1%) severely oligozoospermic patients (<10(6) sperm/ml) harbor KLHL10 alterations that were absent in 394 controls and exhibited significant association (P=0.02). Two KLHL10 missense mutations (A313T and Q216P) resulted in impaired homodimerization with the wild-type protein in yeast interaction assays, suggesting a functional deficiency. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach for analysis of haploid germ cell-expressed genes regulating post-meiotic events including sperm maturation, motility and fertilization. The development of non-invasive techniques to analyze genetic defects of human spermatogenesis, previously possible only with invasive testis biopsies, provides important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for reproductive medicine.

10869553|t|Heterocomplex formation between metastasis-related protein S100A4 (Mts1) and S100A1 as revealed by the yeast two-hybrid system.
10869553|t|S100A4 (Mts1) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein of the S100 family. This protein plays an important role in promoting tumor metastasis. In order to identify S100A4 interacting proteins, we have applied the yeast two-hybrid system as an in vivo approach. By screening a mouse mammary adenocarcinoma library, we have demonstrated that S100A4 forms a heterocomplex with S100A1, another member of the S100 family. The non-covalent heterodimerization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Mutational analysis revealed that replacement of Cys(76) and/or Cys(81) of S100A4 by Ser abolishes the S100A4/S100A1 heterodimerization, but does not affect the S100A4 homodimerization in vivo.

12571249|t|Direct binding of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain to the catalytic domain of protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) increases focal adhesion localization of PKC alpha.
12571249|t|Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that acts as a coreceptor with integrins in focal adhesion formation. The central region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (4V; LGKKPIYKK) binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and together they regulate protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) activity. Syndecan 4V peptide directly potentiates PKC alpha activity, leading to "superactivation" of the enzyme, apparently through an interaction with its catalytic domain. We now have performed yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays to determine the interaction sites between 4V and PKC alpha. Full-length PKC alpha weakly interacted with 4V by yeast two-hybrid assays, but PKC alpha constructs that lack the pseudosubstrate region or constructs of the whole catalytic domain interacted more strongly. A mutated 4V sequence (4V(YF): LGKKPIFKK) did not interact with PKC alpha, indicating that tyrosine 192 in the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain might be critical for this interaction. Further assays identified a novel interaction site in the C terminus of the catalytic domain of PKC alpha (amino acid sequence 513-672). This encompasses the autophosphorylation sites, which are implicated in activation and stability. Yeast two-hybrid data were confirmed by in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays. The interaction of syndecan-4 with PKC alpha appears unique since PKC delta and epsilon did not interact with 4V in yeast two-hybrid assays or coimmunoprecipitate with syndecan-4. Finally, overexpression of syndecan-4 in rat embryo fibroblast cells, but not expression of the YF mutant, increased PKC alpha localization to focal adhesions. The data support a mechanism where syndecan-4 binds PKC alpha and localizes it to focal adhesions, whose assembly may be regulated by the kinase.

21984795|t|The same periplasmic ExbD residues mediate in vivo interactions between ExbD homodimers and ExbD-TonB heterodimers.
21984795|t|The TonB system couples cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force to TonB-gated outer membrane transporters for active transport of nutrients into the periplasm. In Escherichia coli, cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD promote conformational changes in TonB, which transmits this energy to the transporters. The only known energy-dependent interaction occurs between the periplasmic domains of TonB and ExbD. This study identified sites of in vivo homodimeric interactions within ExbD periplasmic domain residues 92 to 121. ExbD was active as a homodimer (ExbD(2)) but not through all Cys substitution sites, suggesting the existence of conformationally dynamic regions in the ExbD periplasmic domain. A subset of homodimeric interactions could not be modeled on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure without significant distortion. Most importantly, the majority of ExbD Cys substitutions that mediated homodimer formation also mediated ExbD-TonB heterodimer formation with TonB A150C. Consistent with the implied competition, ExbD homodimer formation increased in the absence of TonB. Although ExbD D25 was not required for their formation, ExbD dimers interacted in vivo with ExbB. ExbD-TonB interactions required ExbD transmembrane domain residue D25. These results suggested a model where ExbD(2) assembled with ExbB undergoes a transmembrane domain-dependent transition and exchanges partners in localized homodimeric interfaces to form an ExbD(2)-TonB heterotrimer. The findings here were also consistent with our previous hypothesis that ExbD guides the conformation of the TonB periplasmic domain, which itself is conformationally dynamic.

16151013|t|PUMA couples the nuclear and cytoplasmic proapoptotic function of p53.
16151013|t|The Trp53 tumor suppressor gene product (p53) functions in the nucleus to regulate proapoptotic genes, whereas cytoplasmic p53 directly activates proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to permeabilize mitochondria and initiate apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that a tripartite nexus between Bcl-xL, cytoplasmic p53, and PUMA coordinates these distinct p53 functions. After genotoxic stress, Bcl-xL sequestered cytoplasmic p53. Nuclear p53 caused expression of PUMA, which then displaced p53 from Bcl-xL, allowing p53 to induce mitochondrial permeabilization. Mutant Bcl-xL that bound p53, but not PUMA, rendered cells resistant to p53-induced apoptosis irrespective of PUMA expression. Thus, PUMA couples the nuclear and cytoplasmic proapoptotic functions of p53.

14707132|t|Characterization of OSR1, a member of the mammalian Ste20p/germinal center kinase subfamily.
14707132|t|In examining the protein kinase components of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) cascades that regulate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Drosophila S2 cells, we previously found that distinct upstream kinases were involved in responses to sorbitol and lipopolysaccharide. Here we have extended that analysis to the possible MAPK kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) in the JNK pathway. Fray, a putative Drosophila MAP4K, provided a major contribution to JNK activation by sorbitol. To explore the possible link to JNK in mammalian cells, we isolated and characterized OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive 1), one of two human Fray homologs. OSR1 is a 58-kDa protein of 527 amino acids that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and cell lines. Of potential regulators surveyed, endogenous OSR1 is activated only by osmotic stresses, notably sorbitol and to a lesser extent NaCl. However, OSR1 did not increase the activity of coexpressed JNK, nor did it activate three other MAPKs, p38, ERK2, and ERK5. A two-hybrid screen implicated another Ste20p family member, the p21-activated protein kinase PAK1, as an OSR1 target. OSR1 phosphorylated threonine 84 in the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK1. Replacement of threonine 84 with glutamate reduced the activation of PAK1 by an active form of the small G protein Cdc42, suggesting that phosphorylation by OSR1 modulates the G protein sensitivity of PAK isoforms.

21903585|t|RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) interacts with the meiotic recombinase DMC1 through a conserved motif.
21903585|t|Homologous recombination (HR) reactions mediated by the RAD51 recombinase are essential for DNA and replication fork repair, genome stability, and tumor suppression. RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) is an important HR factor that associates with and stimulates the recombinase activity of RAD51. We have recently shown that RAD51AP1 also partners with the meiotic recombinase DMC1, displaying isoform-specific interactions with DMC1. Here, we have characterized the DMC1 interaction site in RAD51AP1 by a series of truncations and point mutations to uncover a highly conserved WVPP motif critical for DMC1 interaction but dispensable for RAD51 association. This RAD51AP1 motif is reminiscent of the FVPP motif in the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2 that mediates DMC1 interaction. These results further implicate RAD51AP1 in meiotic HR via RAD51 and DMC1.

16449236|t|Functional interactions between FOXC1 and PITX2 underlie the sensitivity to FOXC1 gene dose in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and anterior segment dysgenesis.
16449236|t|Axenfeld-Rieger ocular dysgenesis is associated with mutations of the human PITX2 and FOXC1 genes, which encode transcription factors of the homeodomain and forkhead types, respectively. We have identified a functional link between FOXC1 and PITX2 which we propose underpins the similar Axenfeld-Rieger phenotype caused by mutations of these genes. FOXC1 and PITX2A physically interact, and this interaction requires crucial functional domains on both proteins: the C-terminal activation domain of FOXC1 and the homeodomain of PITX2. Immunofluorescence further shows PITX2A and FOXC1 to be colocalized within a common nuclear subcompartment. Furthermore, PITX2A can function as a negative regulator of FOXC1 transactivity. This work ties both proteins into a common pathway and offers an explanation of why increased FOXC1 gene dosage produces a phenotype resembling that of PITX2 deletions and mutations. Ocular phenotypes arise despite the deregulated expression of FOXC1-target genes through mutations in FOXC1 or PITX2. Ultimately, PITX2 loss of function mutations have a compound effect: the reduced expression of PITX2-target genes coupled with the extensive activation of FOXC1-regulated targets. Our findings indicate that the functional interaction between FOXC1 and PITX2A underlies the sensitivity to FOXC1 gene dosage in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and related anterior segment dysgeneses.

11124807|t|Direct protein-protein interaction between the intracellular domain of TRA-2 and the transcription factor TRA-1A modulates feminizing activity in C. elegans.
11124807|t|In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the zinc finger transcriptional regulator TRA-1A directs XX somatic cells to adopt female fates. The membrane protein TRA-2A indirectly activates TRA-1A by binding and inhibiting a masculinizing protein, FEM-3. Here we report that a part of the intracellular domain of TRA-2A, distinct from the FEM-3 binding region, directly binds TRA-1A. Overproduction of this TRA-1A-binding region has tra-1-dependent feminizing activity in somatic tissues, indicating that the interaction enhances TRA-1A activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that tra-2(mx) mutations, which weakly masculinize somatic tissues, disrupt the TRA-2/TRA-1A interaction. Paradoxically, tra-2(mx) mutations feminize the XX germ line, as do tra-1 mutations mapping to the TRA-2 binding domain. We propose that these mutations render tra-2 insensitive to a negative regulator in the XX germ line, and we speculate that this regulator targets the TRA-2/TRA-1 complex. The intracellular domain of TRA-2A is likely to be produced as a soluble protein in vivo through proteolytic cleavage of TRA-2A or through translation of an XX germ line-specific mRNA. We further show that tagged derivatives of the intracellular domain of TRA-2 localize to the nucleus, supporting the hypothesis that this domain is capable of modulating TRA-1A activity in a manner reminiscent of Notch and Su(H).

21468031|t|The oligomeric state of CtBP determines its role as a transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor of Wingless targets.
21468031|t|C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) is a well-characterized transcriptional co-repressor that requires homo-dimerization for its activity. CtBP can both repress and activate Wingless nuclear targets in Drosophila. Here, we examine the role of CtBP dimerization in these opposing processes. CtBP mutants that cannot dimerize are able to promote Wingless signalling, but are defective in repressing Wingless targets. To further test the role of dimerization in repression, the positions of basic and acidic residues that form inter-molecular salt bridges in the CtBP dimerization interface were swapped. These mutants cannot homo-dimerize and are compromised for repression. However, their co-expression leads to hetero-dimerization and consequent repression of Wingless targets. Our results support a model where CtBP is a gene-specific regulator of Wingless signalling, with some targets requiring CtBP dimers for inhibition while other targets utilize CtBP monomers for activation of their expression. Functional interactions between CtBP and Pygopus, a nuclear protein required for Wingless signalling, support a model where monomeric CtBP acts downstream of Pygopus in activating some Wingless targets.

9488481|t|ZIP kinase, a novel serine/threonine kinase which mediates apoptosis.
9488481|t|We have identified a novel serine/threonine kinase, designated ZIP kinase, which mediates apoptosis. ZIP kinase contains a leucine zipper structure at its C terminus, in addition to a kinase domain at its N terminus. ZIP kinase physically binds to ATF4, a member of the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (ATF/CREB) family, through interaction between their leucine zippers. The leucine zipper domain is necessary for the homodimerization of ZIP kinase as well as for the activation of kinase. Immunostaining study showed that ZIP kinase localizes in the nuclei. Overexpression of intact ZIP kinase but not catalytically inactive kinase mutants led to the morphological changes of apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the cell death-inducing activity of ZIP kinase depends on its intrinsic kinase activity. Interestingly, the catalytic domain of ZIP kinase is closely related to that of death-associated protein kinase (DAP kinase), which is a mediator of apoptosis induced by gamma interferon. Therefore, both ZIP and DAP kinases represent a novel kinase family, which mediates apoptosis through their catalytic activities.

12907709|t|Rpb7 subunit of RNA polymerase II interacts with an RNA-binding protein involved in processing of transcripts.
12907709|t|Rpb4-Rpb7, a dissociable subcomplex of RNA polymerase II (pol II), is required for transcription initiation. To understand the role of Rpb7 in transcription initiation or other processes in transcription, we carried out a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Rpb7 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The screen identified the S.pombe homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nrd1, an RNA-binding protein implicated in 3' end formation of small nucleolar and small nuclear RNAs transcribed by pol II. The S.pombe protein, named Seb1 for seven binding, was essential for cell viability, and bound directly to Rpb7 in vitro. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb7 also interacted with Nrd1, indicating that the interaction is conserved in evolution. Glu166 and/or Asp167 of S.pombe Rpb7, residues near the C-terminus of the 172 amino acid protein, were found to be important for its interaction with Seb1. Our results suggest that Rpb7 may function to anchor a processing factor to the pol II apparatus, thereby coupling RNA processing to transcription. The role for Rpb7 is consistent with its location in the pol II complex determined by recent structural studies.

16166382|t|Structural basis for the enhancement of eIF4A helicase activity by eIF4G.
16166382|t|The eukaryotic translation initiation factors 4A (eIF4A) and 4G (eIF4G) are crucial for the assembly of the translationally active ribosome. Together with eIF4E, they form the eIF4F complex, which recruits the 40S subunit to the 5' cap of mRNA. The two-domain RNA helicase eIF4A is a very weak helicase by itself, but the activity is enhanced upon interaction with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. Here we show that, albeit both eIF4A domains play a role in binding the middle domain of eIF4G (eIF4G-m, amino acids 745-1003), the main interaction surface is located on the C-terminal domain. We use NMR spectroscopy to define the binding site and find that the contact surface is adjacent to the RNA-, ATP-, and eIF4A-NTD-interacting regions. Mutations of interface residues abrogated binding, confirmed the interface, and showed that the N-terminal end of eIF4G-m interacts with the C-terminal domain of eIF4A. The data suggest that eIF4G-m forms a soft clamp to stabilize the closed interdomain orientation of eIF4A. This model can explain the cooperativity between all binding partners of eIF4A (eIF4G, RNA, ATP) and stimulation of eIF4A activity in the eIF4F complex.

19732766|t|Cirhin up-regulates a canonical NF-kappaB element through strong interaction with Cirip/HIVEP1.
19732766|t|North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC/CIRH1A) is a severe autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis. All NAIC patients have a homozygous mutation in CIRH1A that changes conserved Arg565 to Trp (R565W) in Cirhin, a nucleolar protein of unknown function. Subcellular localization is unaffected by the mutation. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified Cirip (Cirhin interaction protein) and found that interaction between Cirip and R565W-Cirhin was weakened. Co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells strongly supports the yeast two hybrid results. Cirip has essentially the same sequence as the C-terminal of HIVEP1, a regulator of a canonical NF-kappaB sequence. Since Cirip has the zinc fingers required for this interaction, we developed an in vitro assay based on this element in mammalian cells to demonstrate functional Cirhin-Cirip interaction. The strong positive effect of Cirip on the NF-kappaB sequence was further increased by both Cirhin and R565W-Cirhin. Importantly, the effect of R565W-Cirhin was weaker than that of the wild type protein. We observed increased levels of Cirhin-Cirip complex in nuclear extracts in the presence of this NF-kappaB sequence. Our hypothesis is that Cirhin is a transcriptional regulatory factor of this NF-kappaB sequence and could be a participant in the regulation of other genes with NF-kappaB responsive elements. Since the activities of genes regulated through NF-kappaB responsive elements are especially important during development, this interaction may be a key to explain the perinatal appearance of NAIC.

11302744|t|Menin, a gene product responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, interacts with the putative tumor metastasis suppressor nm23.
11302744|t|Although the gene responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) has been identified, the function of its gene product, menin, is unknown. To examine the biological role of the MEN1 gene, we searched for associated proteins with a yeast two-hybrid system using the MEN1 cDNA fragment as bait. On screening a rat fetal brain embryonic day 17 library, in which a high level of MEN1 expression was detected, we identified a putative tumor metastasis suppressor nm23/nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase as an associated protein. This finding was confirmed by in vitro interaction assays based on glutathione S-transferase pull down experiments. The association required almost the entire menin protein, and several missense MEN1 mutations reported in MEN1 patients caused a loss of the binding activity for nm23. This result suggests that this interaction may play important roles in the biological functions of the menin protein, including tumor suppressor activity.

20388642|t|Overexpression of optineurin E50K disrupts Rab8 interaction and leads to a progressive retinal degeneration in mice.
20388642|t|Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of bilateral blindness affecting nearly 8 million people worldwide. Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and is often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). However, patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), a subtype of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), develop the disease without IOP elevation. The molecular pathways leading to the pathology of NTG and POAG are still unclear. Here, we describe the phenotypic characteristics of transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (Wt) or mutated optineurin (Optn). Mutations E50K, H486R and Optn with a deletion of the first (amino acids 153-174) or second (amino acids 426-461) leucine zipper were used for overexpression. After 16 months, histological abnormalities were exclusively observed in the retina of E50K mutant mice with loss of RGCs and connecting synapses in the peripheral retina leading to a thinning of the nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve head at normal IOP. E50K mice also showed massive apoptosis and degeneration of entire retina, leading to approximately a 28% reduction of the retina thickness. At the molecular level, introduction of the E50K mutation disrupts the interaction between Optn and Rab8 GTPase, a protein involved in the regulation of vesicle transport from Golgi to plasma membrane. Wt Optn and an active GTP-bound form of Rab8 complex were localized at the Golgi complex. These data suggest that alternation of the Optn sequence can initiate significant retinal degeneration in mice.

18216290|t|Selective targeting of the gamma1 isoform of protein phosphatase 1 to F-actin in intact cells requires multiple domains in spinophilin and neurabin.
18216290|t|Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunits dephosphorylate specific substrates in discrete subcellular compartments to modulate many cellular processes. Canonical PP1-binding motifs (R/K-V/I-X-F) in a family of proteins mediate subcellular targeting, and the amino acids that form the binding pocket for the canonical motif are identical in all PP1 isoforms. However, PP1gamma1 but not PP1beta is selectively localized to F-actin-rich dendritic spines in neurons. Although the F-actin-binding proteins neurabin I and spinophilin (neurabin II) also bind PP1, their role in PP1 isoform selective targeting in intact cells is poorly understood. We show here that spinophilin selectively targets PP1gamma1, but not PP1beta, to F-actin-rich cortical regions of intact cells. Mutation of a PP1gamma1 selectivity determinant (N(464)EDYDRR(470) in spinophilin: conserved as residues 473-479 in neurabin) to VKDYDTW severely attenuated PP1gamma1 interactions with neurabins in vitro and in cells and disrupted PP1gamma1 targeting to F-actin. This domain is not involved in the weaker interactions of neurabins with PP1beta. In contrast, mutation of the canonical PP1-binding motif attenuated interactions of neurabins with both isoforms. Thus, selective targeting of PP1gamma1 to F-actin by neurabins in intact cells requires both the canonical PP1-binding motif and an auxiliary PP1gamma1-selectivity determinant.

16619031|t|A CDK-catalysed regulatory phosphorylation for formation of the DNA replication complex Sld2-Dpb11.
16619031|t|Phosphorylation often regulates protein-protein interactions to control biological reactions. The Sld2 and Dpb11 proteins of budding yeast form a phosphorylation-dependent complex that is essential for chromosomal DNA replication. The Sld2 protein has a cluster of 11 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation motifs (Ser/Thr-Pro), six of which match the canonical sequences Ser/Thr-Pro-X-Lys/Arg, Lys/Arg-Ser/Thr-Pro and Ser/Thr-Pro-Lys/Arg. Simultaneous alanine substitution for serine or threonine in all the canonical CDK-phosphorylation motifs severely reduces complex formation between Sld2 and Dpb11, and inhibits DNA replication. Here we show that phosphorylation of these canonical motifs does not play a direct role in complex formation, but rather regulates phosphorylation of another residue, Thr84. This constitutes a non-canonical CDK-phosphorylation motif within a 28-amino-acid sequence that is responsible, after phosphorylation, for binding of Sld2-Dpb11. We further suggest that CDK-catalysed phosphorylation of sites other than Thr84 renders Thr84 accessible to CDK. Finally, we argue that this novel mechanism sets a threshold of CDK activity for formation of the essential Sld2 to Dpb11 complex and therefore prevents premature DNA replication.

20067578|t|MKK6 binds and regulates expression of Parkinson's disease-related protein LRRK2.
20067578|t|Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are prevalent causes of late-onset Parkinson's disease. Here, we show that LRRK2 binds to MAPK kinases (MKK) 3, 6, and 7, and that LRRK2 is able to phosphorylate MKK3, 6 and 7. Over-expression of LRRK2 and MKK6 increased the steady state levels of each protein beyond that observed with over-expression of either protein alone. Co-expression increased levels of MKK6 in the membrane more than in the cytoplasm. The increased expression of LRRK2 and MKK6 requires MKK6 activity. The disease-linked LRRK2 mutations, G2019S, R1441C and I2020T, enhance binding of LRRK2 to MKK6. This interaction was further supported by in vivo studies in C. elegans. RNAi knockdown in C. elegans of the endogenous orthologs for MKK6 or p38, sek-1 and pmk-1, abolishes LRRK2-mediated protection against mitochondrial stress. These results were confirmed by deletion of sek-1 in C. elegans. These data demonstrate that MKKs and LRRK2 function in similar biological pathways, and support a role for LRRK2 in modulating the cellular stress response.

24024660|t|A S52P mutation in the 'a-crystallin domain' of Mycobacterium leprae HSP18 reduces its oligomeric size and chaperone function.
24024660|t|Mycobacterium leprae HSP18 is a small heat shock protein (sHSP). It is a major immunodominant antigen of M. leprae pathogen. Previously, we have reported the existence of two M. leprae HSP18 variants in various leprotic patients. One of the variants has serine at position 52, whereas the other one has proline at the same position. We have also reported that HSP18 having proline at position 52 (HSP18P(52)) is a nonameric protein and exhibits chaperone function. However, the structural and functional characterization of wild-type HSP18 having serine at position 52 (HSP18S(52)) is yet to be explored. Furthermore, the implications of the S52P mutation on the structure and chaperone function of HSP18 are not well understood. Therefore, we cloned and purified these two HSP18 variants. We found that HSP18S(52) is also a molecular chaperone and an oligomeric protein. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and far-UV CD measurements revealed that the S52P mutation altered the tertiary and secondary structure of HSP18. This point mutation also reduced the oligomeric assembly and decreased the surface hydrophobicity of HSP18, as revealed by HPLC and 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid binding studies, respectively. Mutant protein was less stable against thermal and chemical denaturation and was more susceptible towards tryptic cleavage than wild-type HSP18. HSP18P(52) had lower chaperone function and was less effective in protecting thermal killing of Escherichia coli than HSP18S(52). Taken together, our data suggest that serine 52 is important for the larger oligomerization and chaperone function of HSP18. Because both variants differ in stability and function, they may have different roles in the survival of M. leprae in infected hosts.

18588881|t|Flightless-I, a gelsolin family member and transcriptional regulator, preferentially binds directly to activated cytosolic CaMK-II.
18588881|t|In order to evaluate links between Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMK-II) and cell cycle progression, CaMK-II binding partners were sought in proliferating cells by epitope-tag tandem mass spectrometry. One protein identified was the gelsolin family member, flightless-I (Fli-I). Fli-I is not a CaMK-II substrate, but binds directly and preferentially to constitutively active (T287D) CaMK-II over inactive CaMK-II. Fli-I gradually enters the nucleus upon CaMK-II inhibition and is retained in the cytosol by T287D CaMK-II. CaMK-II inhibition and Fli-I overexpression suppress transcription of beta-catenin dependent transcriptional reporters, whereas Fli-I suppression enhances their transcription. These findings support a novel mechanism whereby cytosolic CaMK-II influences beta-catenin dependent gene expression through Fli-I.

22854040|t|Optineurin mediates a negative regulation of Rab8 by the GTPase-activating protein TBC1D17.
22854040|t|Rab GTPases regulate various membrane trafficking pathways but the mechanisms by which GTPase-activating proteins recognise specific Rabs are not clear. Rab8 is involved in controlling several trafficking processes, including the trafficking of transferrin receptor from the early endosome to the recycling endosome. Here, we provide evidence to show that TBC1D17, a Rab GTPase-activating protein, through its catalytic activity, regulates Rab8-mediated endocytic trafficking of transferrin receptor. Optineurin, a Rab8-binding effector protein, mediates the interaction and colocalisation of TBC1D17 with Rab8. A non-catalytic region of TBC1D17 is required for direct interaction with optineurin. Co-expression of Rab8, but not other Rabs tested, rescues the inhibition of transferrin receptor trafficking by TBC1D17. The activated GTP-bound form of Rab8 is localised to the tubules emanating from the endocytic recycling compartment. Through its catalytic activity, TBC1D17 inhibits recruitment of Rab8 to the tubules and reduces colocalisation of transferrin receptor and Rab8. Knockdown of optineurin or TBC1D17 results in enhanced recruitment of Rab8 to the tubules. A glaucoma-associated mutant of optineurin, E50K, causes enhanced inhibition of Rab8 by TBC1D17, resulting in defective endocytic recycling of transferrin receptor. Our results show that TBC1D17, through its interaction with optineurin, regulates Rab8-mediated endocytic recycling of transferrin receptor and recruitment of Rab8 to the endocytic recycling tubules. We describe a mechanism of regulating a Rab GTPase by an effector protein (optineurin) that acts as an adaptor to bring together a Rab (Rab8) and its GTPase-activating protein (TBC1D17).

17157260|t|Yng1 PHD finger binding to H3 trimethylated at K4 promotes NuA3 HAT activity at K14 of H3 and transcription at a subset of targeted ORFs.
17157260|t|Posttranslational histone modifications participate in modulating the structure and function of chromatin. Promoters of transcribed genes are enriched with K4 trimethylation and hyperacetylation on the N-terminal tail of histone H3. Recently, PHD finger proteins, like Yng1 in the NuA3 HAT complex, were shown to interact with H3K4me3, indicating a biochemical link between K4 methylation and hyperacetylation. By using a combination of mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and NMR, we detail the Yng1 PHD-H3K4me3 interaction and the importance of NuA3-dependent acetylation at K14. Furthermore, genome-wide ChIP-Chip analysis demonstrates colocalization of Yng1 and H3K4me3 in vivo. Disrupting the K4me3 binding of Yng1 altered K14ac and transcription at certain genes, thereby demonstrating direct in vivo evidence of sequential trimethyl binding, acetyltransferase activity, and gene regulation by NuA3. Our data support a general mechanism of transcriptional control through which histone acetylation upstream of gene activation is promoted partially through availability of H3K4me3, "read" by binding modules in select subunits.

10633111|t|The Agrobacterium T-DNA transport pore proteins VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 interact with one another.
10633111|t|The VirB proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens form a transport pore to transfer DNA from bacteria to plants. The assembly of the transport pore will require interaction among the constituent proteins. The identification of proteins that interact with one another can provide clues to the assembly of the transport pore. We studied interaction among four putative transport pore proteins, VirB7, VirB8, VirB9 and VirB10. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we observed that VirB8, VirB9, and VirB10 interact with one another. In vitro studies using protein fusions demonstrated that VirB10 interacts with VirB9 and itself. These results suggest that the outer membrane VirB7-VirB9 complex interacts with the inner membrane proteins VirB8 and VirB10 for the assembly of the transport pore. Fusions that contain small, defined segments of the proteins were used to define the interaction domains of VirB8 and VirB9. All interaction domains of both proteins mapped to the N-terminal half of the proteins. Two separate domains at the N- and C-terminal ends of VirB9 are involved in its homotypic interaction, suggesting that VirB9 forms a higher oligomer. We observed that the alteration of serine at position 87 of VirB8 to leucine abolished its DNA transfer function. Studies on the interaction of the mutant protein with the other VirB proteins showed that the VirB8S87L mutant is defective in interaction with VirB9. The mutant, however, interacted efficiently with VirB8 and VirB10, suggesting that the VirB8-VirB9 interaction is essential for DNA transfer.

9263453|t|Interaction of the maize and Arabidopsis kinase interaction domains with a subset of receptor-like protein kinases: implications for transmembrane signaling in plants.
9263453|t|The kinase interaction (KI) domain of kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) interacts with the phosphorylated form of an Arabidopsis thaliana receptor-like protein kinase (RLK). The KI domain may recruit KAPP into an RLK-initiated signaling complex. To examine additional roles that this domain may play in plant signal transduction, a search was conducted for other KI domain-containing proteins. One gene was isolated which encodes a KI domain, the maize homolog of KAPP. To test whether the maize KI domain associates with other maize proteins, it was used as a probe in a protein-protein interaction cloning strategy. A new maize RLK, KI domain interacting kinase 1 (KIK1), was identified by its interaction with the maize KI domain. The maize KI domain and the KIK1 kinase domain association required phosphorylation of the kinase. This work establishes that the KI domain phosphorylation-dependent signaling mechanism is present in both monocots and dicots. Additionally, it was determined that both the maize and Arabidopsis KI domains interact with several but not all of the active RLKs assayed. These multiple associations imply that KAPP may function in a number of RLK-initiated signaling pathways.

19798056|t|Participation of Tom1L1 in EGF-stimulated endocytosis of EGF receptor.
19798056|t|Although many proteins have been shown to participate in ligand-stimulated endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR), the adaptor protein responsible for interaction of activated EGFR with endocytic machinery remains elusive. We show here that EGF stimulates transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Tom1L1 by the Src family kinases, resulting in transient interaction of Tom1L1 with the activated EGFR bridged by Grb2 and Shc. Cytosolic Tom1L1 is recruited onto the plasma membrane and subsequently redistributes into the early endosome. Mutant forms of Tom1L1 defective in Tyr-phosphorylation or interaction with Grb2 are incapable of interaction with EGFR. These mutants behave as dominant-negative mutants to inhibit endocytosis of EGFR. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Tom1L1 inhibits endocytosis of EGFR. The C-terminal tail of Tom1L1 contains a novel clathrin-interacting motif responsible for interaction with the C-terminal region of clathrin heavy chain, which is important for exogenous Tom1L1 to rescue endocytosis of EGFR in Tom1L1 knocked-down cells. These results suggest that EGF triggers a transient Grb2/Shc-mediated association of EGFR with Tyr-phosphorylated Tom1L1 to engage the endocytic machinery for endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex.

15143163|t|The LRP5 high-bone-mass G171V mutation disrupts LRP5 interaction with Mesd.
15143163|t|The mechanism by which the high-bone-mass (HBM) mutation (G171V) of the Wnt coreceptor LRP5 regulates canonical Wnt signaling was investigated. The mutation was previously shown to reduce DKK1-mediated antagonism, suggesting that the first YWTD repeat domain where G171 is located may be responsible for DKK-mediated antagonism. However, we found that the third YWTD repeat, but not the first repeat domain, is required for DKK1-mediated antagonism. Instead, we found that the G171V mutation disrupted the interaction of LRP5 with Mesd, a chaperone protein for LRP5/6 that is required for transport of the coreceptors to cell surfaces, resulting in fewer LRP5 molecules on the cell surface. Although the reduction in the number of cell surface LRP5 molecules led to a reduction in Wnt signaling in a paracrine paradigm, the mutation did not appear to affect the activity of coexpressed Wnt in an autocrine paradigm. Together with the observation that osteoblast cells produce autocrine canonical Wnt, Wnt7b, and that osteocytes produce paracrine DKK1, we think that the G171V mutation may cause an increase in Wnt activity in osteoblasts by reducing the number of targets for paracrine DKK1 to antagonize without affecting the activity of autocrine Wnt.

16126728|t|Positive regulation of IkappaB kinase signaling by protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A.
16126728|t|Transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a key regulatory role in the cellular response to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). In the absence of TNF, NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. Phosphorylation of IkappaBby the beta-catalytic subunit of IKK, a multicomponent IkappaB kinase, targets the inhibitor for proteolytic destruction and facilitates nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. This pathway is initiated by TNF-dependent phosphorylation of T loop serines in IKKbeta, which greatly stimulates IkappaB kinase activity. Prior in vitro mixing experiments indicate that protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can dephosphorylate these T loop serines and inactivate IKK, suggesting a negative regulatory role for PP2A in IKK signaling. Here we provided several in vivo lines of evidence indicating that PP2A plays a positive rather than a negative role in the regulation of IKK. First, TNF-induced degradation of IkappaB is attenuated in cells treated with okadaic acid or fostriecin, two potent inhibitors of PP2A. Second, PP2A forms stable complexes with IKK in untransfected mammalian cells. This interaction is critically dependent on amino acid residues 121-179 of the IKKgamma regulatory subunit. Third, deletion of the PP2A-binding site in IKKgamma attenuates T loop phosphorylation and catalytic activation of IKKbeta in cells treated with TNF. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that the formation of IKK.PP2A complexes is required for the proper induction of IkappaB kinase activity in vivo.

11397791|t|Phosphorylation of Thr(495) regulates Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity.
11397791|t|The activity of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) can be regulated independently of an increase in Ca(2+) by the phosphorylation of Ser(1177) but results only in a low nitric oxide (NO) output. In the present study, we assessed whether the agonist-induced (Ca(2+)-dependent, high-output) activation of eNOS is associated with changes in the phosphorylation of Thr(495) in the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain. eNOS Thr(495) was constitutively phosphorylated in porcine aortic endothelial cells and was rapidly dephosphorylated after bradykinin stimulation. In the same cells, bradykinin enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser(1177), which was maximal after 5 minutes, and abolished by the CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93. Bradykinin also enhanced the association of CaMKII with eNOS. Phosphorylation of Thr(495) was attenuated by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro 31-8220 and after PKC downregulation using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The agonist-induced dephosphorylation of Thr(495) was completely Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by the PP1 inhibitor calyculin A. Little CaM was bound to eNOS immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells, but the agonist-induced dephosphorylation of Thr(495) enhanced the association of CaM. Mutation of Thr(495) to alanine increased CaM binding to eNOS in the absence of cell stimulation, whereas the corresponding Asp(495) mutant bound almost no CaM. Accordingly, NO production by the Ala(495) mutant was more sensitive to Ca(2+)/CaM than the aspartate mutant. These results suggest that the dual phosphorylation of Ser(1177) and Thr(495) determines the activity of eNOS in agonist-stimulated endothelial cells. Moreover, the dephosphorylation of Thr(495) by PP1 precedes the phosphorylation of Ser(1177) by CaMKII. The full text of this article is available at http://www.circresaha.org.

9162036|t|Serine 331 and tyrosine 333 are both involved in the interaction between the cytosolic domain of TGN38 and the mu2 subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex.
9162036|t|TGN38 is a type I integral membrane protein that cycles between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Internalization at the cell surface and targeting back to the trans-Golgi network is dependent on a hexapeptide motif, SDYQRL, in the cytosolic tail of the protein. It was recently demonstrated that this motif specifically interacts with the mu2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex. We have studied the interaction between the entire cytosolic domain of TGN38 and mu2 using the yeast two hybrid system, in vitro binding of recombinant fusion proteins and IAsys optical biosensor technology. A specific interaction has been demonstrated in each of the systems we have employed. We have shown an absolute requirement for Tyr-333 of TGN38 in binding to mu2. In addition we found that mutation of Ser-331 to alanine reduces the affinity of the interaction. By measuring tryptophan fluorescence at equilibrium, we have also determined the dissociation constant for the interaction between the entire cytosolic tail of TGN38 and mu2 as 58 nM. In contrast to previously published work, our data suggest that not only Tyr-333 but also its context is important in determining the specificity of binding of TGN38 to mu2.

24349490|t|Rab39a interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and negatively regulates autophagy induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation in macrophages.
24349490|t|Rab39a has pleiotropic functions in phagosome maturation, inflammatory activation and neuritogenesis. Here, we characterized Rab39a function in membrane trafficking of phagocytosis and autophagy induction in macrophages. Rab39a localized to the periphery of LAMP2-positive vesicles and showed the similar kinetics on the phagosome to that of LAMP1. The depletion of Rab39a did not influence the localization of LAMP2 to the phagosome, but it augments the autophagosome formation and LC3 processing by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The augmentation of autophagosome formation in Rab39a-knockdown macrophages was suppressed by Atg5 depletion or an inhibitor for phosphatidylinostol 3-kinase (PI3K). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Rab39a interacts with PI3K and that the amino acid residues from 34(th) to 41(st) in Rab39a were indispensable for this interaction. These results suggest that Rab39a negatively regulates the LPS-induced autophagy in macrophages.

20935634|t|The Fas-FADD death domain complex structure reveals the basis of DISC assembly and disease mutations.
20935634|t|The death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formed by the death receptor Fas, the adaptor protein FADD and caspase-8 mediates the extrinsic apoptotic program. Mutations in Fas that disrupt the DISC cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Here we show that the Fas-FADD death domain (DD) complex forms an asymmetric oligomeric structure composed of 5-7 Fas DD and 5 FADD DD, whose interfaces harbor ALPS-associated mutations. Structure-based mutations disrupt the Fas-FADD interaction in vitro and in living cells; the severity of a mutation correlates with the number of occurrences of a particular interaction in the structure. The highly oligomeric structure explains the requirement for hexameric or membrane-bound FasL in Fas signaling. It also predicts strong dominant negative effects from Fas mutations, which are confirmed by signaling assays. The structure optimally positions the FADD death effector domain (DED) to interact with the caspase-8 DED for caspase recruitment and higher-order aggregation.

10602478|t|Evidence for interaction between human PRUNE and nm23-H1 NDPKinase.
10602478|t|We have isolated a human and murine homologue of the Drosophila prune gene through dbEST searches. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues, while in mouse developing embryos a high level of expression is confined to the nervous system particularly in the dorsal root ganglia, cranial nerves, and neural retina. The gene is composed of eight exons and is located in the 1q21.3 chromosomal region. A pseudogene has been sequenced and mapped to chromosomal region 13q12. PRUNE protein retains the four characteristic domains of DHH phosphoesterases. The synergism between prune and awdK-pn in Drosophila has led various authors to propose an interaction between these genes. However, such an interaction has never been supported by biochemical data. By using interaction-mating and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we show for the first time the ability of human PRUNE to interact with the human homologue of awd protein (nm23-H1). In contrast, PRUNE is impaired in its interaction with nm-23-H1-S120G mutant, a gain-of-function mutation associated with advanced neuroblastoma stages. Consistently, PRUNE and nm23-H1 proteins partially colocalize in the cytoplasm. The data presented are consistent with the view that PRUNE acts as a negative regulator of the nm23-H1 protein. We discuss how PRUNE regulates nm23-H1 protein and postulate possible implications of PRUNE in neuroblastoma progression.

11579209|t|Phosphorylation of PTP1B at Ser(50) by Akt impairs its ability to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor.
11579209|t|PTP1B is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates insulin sensitivity by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor. Akt is a ser/thr kinase effector of insulin signaling that phosphorylates substrates at the consensus motif RXRXXS/T. Interestingly, PTP1B contains this motif (RYRDVS(50)), and wild-type PTP1B (but not mutants with substitutions for Ser(50)) was significantly phosphorylated by Akt in vitro. To determine whether PTP1B is a substrate for Akt in intact cells, NIH-3T3(IR) cells transfected with either wild-type PTP1B or PTP1B-S50A were labeled with [(32)P]-orthophosphate. Insulin stimulation caused a significant increase in phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B that could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin or cotransfection of a dominant inhibitory Akt mutant. Similar results were observed with endogenous PTP1B in untransfected HepG2 cells. Cotransfection of constitutively active Akt caused robust phosphorylation of wild-type PTP1B both in the absence and presence of insulin. By contrast, PTP1B-S50A did not undergo phosphorylation in response to insulin. We tested the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser(50) by evaluating insulin receptor autophosphorylation in transfected Cos-7 cells. Insulin treatment caused robust receptor autophosphorylation that could be substantially reduced by coexpression of wild-type PTP1B. Similar results were obtained with coexpression of PTP1B-S50A. However, under the same conditions, PTP1B-S50D had an impaired ability to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. Moreover, cotransfection of constitutively active Akt significantly inhibited the ability of wild-type PTP1B, but not PTP1B-S50A, to dephosphorylate the insulin receptor. We conclude that PTP1B is a novel substrate for Akt and that phosphorylation of PTP1B by Akt at Ser(50) may negatively modulate its phosphatase activity creating a positive feedback mechanism for insulin signaling.

20802522|t|A functional SUMO-interacting motif in the transactivation domain of c-Myb regulates its myeloid transforming ability.
20802522|t|c-Myb is an essential hematopoietic transcription factor that controls proliferation and differentiation of progenitors during blood cell development. Whereas sumoylation of the C-terminal regulatory domain (CRD) is known to have a major impact on the activity of c-Myb, no role for noncovalent binding of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to c-Myb has been described. Based on the consensus SUMO-interacting motif (SIM), we identified and examined putative SIMs in human c-Myb. Interaction and reporter assays showed that the SIM in the in the transactivation domain of c-Myb (V(267)NIV) is functional. This motif is necessary for c-Myb to be able to interact noncovalently with SUMO, preferentially SUMO2/3. Destroying the SUMO-binding properties by mutation resulted in a large increase in the transactivation potential of c-Myb. Mutational analysis and overexpression of conjugation-defective SUMO argued against intramolecular repression caused by sumoylated CRD and in favor of SUMO-dependent repression in trans. Using both a myeloid cell line-based assay and a primary hematopoietic cell assay, we addressed the transforming abilities of SUMO binding and conjugation mutants. Interestingly, only loss of SUMO binding, and not SUMO conjugation, enhanced the myeloid transformational potential of c-Myb. c-Myb with the SIM mutated conferred a higher proliferative ability than the wild-type and caused an effective differentiation block. This establishes SUMO binding as a mechanism involved in modulating the transactivation activity of c-Myb, and responsible for keeping the transforming potential of the oncoprotein in check.

19927120|t|Structural basis for specific recognition of Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains by NZF domains of TAB2 and TAB3.
19927120|t|TAB2 and TAB3 activate the Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways through the specific recognition of Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains by its Npl4 zinc-finger (NZF) domain. Here we report crystal structures of the TAB2 and TAB3 NZF domains in complex with Lys 63-linked diubiquitin at 1.18 and 1.40 A resolutions, respectively. Both NZF domains bind to the distal ubiquitin through a conserved Thr-Phe dipeptide that has been shown to be important for the interaction of the NZF domain of Npl4 with monoubiquitin. In contrast, a surface specific to TAB2 and TAB3 binds the proximal ubiquitin. Both the distal and proximal binding sites of the TAB2 and TAB3 NZF domains recognize the Ile 44-centred hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin but do not interact with the Lys 63-linked isopeptide bond. Mutagenesis experiments show that both binding sites are required to enable binding of Lys 63-linked diubiquitin. We therefore propose a mechanism for the recognition of Lys 63-linked polyubiquitin chains by TAB2 and TAB3 NZF domains in which diubiquitin units are specifically recognized by a single NZF domain.

7518772|t|Phosphorylation of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha on Tyr789, a binding site for the SH3-SH2-SH3 adaptor protein GRB-2 in vivo.
7518772|t|Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTP alpha) is a transmembrane protein with a short extracellular domain (123 amino acids) and two cytoplasmically localized protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains. Here we report that RPTP alpha is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation site was localized to the C-terminus of RPTP alpha by phosphopeptide mapping experiments using in vivo and in vitro 32P-labeled RPTP alpha. The identity of this site as Tyr789, located five residues from the C-terminus, was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Transient overexpression of c-Src together with RPTP alpha in human embryonic kidney 293 cells increased phosphorylation of Tyr789, suggesting that c-Src may phosphorylate RPTP alpha in vivo. RPTP alpha had autodephosphorylation activity in vitro. When expressed in 293 cells the level of Tyr789 phosphorylation was higher in a non-functional mutant of RPTP alpha than in wild type RPTP alpha, indicating that RPTP alpha may have autodephosphorylation activity in vivo as well. The sequence on the C-terminal side of Tyr789 (YANF) fits the consensus binding site for the SH3-SH2-SH3 adaptor protein GRB2 (YXNX). We show that RPTP alpha, but not a mutant of RPTP alpha with a Tyr-->Phe mutation at position 789, bound to GRB2 in vitro. In addition, RPTP alpha co-immunoprecipitated with GRB2 from NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrating that GRB2 bound to RPTP alpha in vivo. The guanine nucleotide releasing factor for the Ras GTPase, Son of sevenless (Sos), which associates with GRB2 via its SH3 domains, was not detected in RPTP alpha immunoprecipitates. Our results suggest a role for RPTP alpha in attenuation of GRB2-mediated signaling.

21505419|t|Structural basis for endosomal recruitment of ESCRT-I by ESCRT-0 in yeast.
21505419|t|The ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complexes coordinate the clustering of ubiquitinated cargo with intralumenal budding of the endosomal membrane, two essential steps in vacuolar/lysosomal protein sorting from yeast to humans. The 1.85-   crystal structure of interacting regions of the yeast ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complexes reveals that PSDP motifs of the Vps27 ESCRT-0 subunit bind to a novel electropositive N-terminal site on the UEV domain of the ESCRT-I subunit Vps23 centred on Trp16. This novel site is completely different from the C-terminal part of the human UEV domain that binds to P(S/T)AP motifs of human ESCRT-0 and HIV-1 Gag. Disruption of the novel PSDP-binding site eliminates the interaction in vitro and blocks enrichment of Vps23 in endosome-related class E compartments in yeast cells. However, this site is non-essential for sorting of the ESCRT cargo Cps1. Taken together, these results show how a conserved motif/domain pair can evolve to use strikingly different binding modes in different organisms.

11226162|t|Identification of a structural motif that confers specific interaction with the WD40 repeat domain of Arabidopsis COP1.
11226162|t|Arabidopsis COP1 is a photomorphogenesis repressor capable of directly interacting with the photomorphogenesis-promoting factor HY5. This interaction between HY5 and COP1 results in targeted deg radation of HY5 by the 26S proteasome. Here we characterized the WD40 repeat domain-mediated interactions of COP1 with HY5 and two new proteins. Mutational analysis of those interactive partners revealed a conserved motif responsible for the interaction with the WD40 domain. This novel motif, with the core sequence V-P-E/D-_-G (_ = hydrophobic residue) in conjunction with an upstream stretch of 4-5 negatively charged residues, interacts with a defined surface area of the ss-propeller assembly of the COP1 WD40 repeat domain through both hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Several residues in the COP1 WD40 domain that are critical for the interaction with this motif have been revealed. The fact that point mutations either in the COP1 WD40 domain or in the HY5 motif that abolish the interaction between COP1 and HY5 in yeast result in a dramatic reduction of HY5 degradation in transgenic plants validates the biological significance of this defined interaction.

15205937|t|Decreased interactions of mutant muscle LIM protein (MLP) with N-RAP and alpha-actinin and their implication for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
15205937|t|Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that MLP can form a ternary complex with two of its previously documented myofibrillar ligand proteins, N-RAP and alpha-actinin, which indicates the presence of distinct, non-overlapping binding sites. Our data also show that, in comparison to wild-type MLP, the capacity of the mutated MLP protein to bind both N-RAP and alpha-actinin is significantly decreased. In addition, this single point mutation prevents zinc coordination and proper folding of the second zinc-finger in the first LIM domain, which consequently renders the protein less stable and more susceptible to proteolysis. The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. This assumption is supported by the previous observation that in the pathological situation accompanied by MLP down regulation, cardiomyocytes try to compensate for the decreased stability of MLP protein by increasing the expression of its ligand N-RAP, which might finally result in the development of myocyte disarray that is characteristic of this disease.

21795333|t|Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) C-terminal-activating region 3 contributes to LMP1-mediated cellular migration via its interaction with Ubc9.
21795333|t|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), the principal viral oncoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is a constitutively active membrane signaling protein that regulates multiple signal transduction pathways via its C-terminal-activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, and also the less-studied CTAR3. Because protein sumoylation among other posttranslational modifications may regulate many signaling pathways induced by LMP1, we investigated whether during EBV latency LMP1 regulates sumoylation processes that control cellular activation and cellular responses. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that LMP1 interacts with Ubc9, the single reported SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Requirements for LMP1-Ubc9 interactions include enzymatically active Ubc9: expression of inactive Ubc9 (Ubc9 C93S) inhibited the LMP1-Ubc9 interaction. LMP1 CTAR3, but not CTAR1 and CTAR2, participated in the LMP1-Ubc9 interaction, and amino acid sequences found in CTAR3, including the JAK-interacting motif, contributed to this interaction. Furthermore, LMP1 expression coincided with increased sumoylation of cellular proteins, and disruption of the Ubc9-LMP1 CTAR3 interaction almost completely abrogated LMP1-induced protein sumoylation, suggesting that this interaction promotes the sumoylation of downstream targets. Additional consequences of the disruption of the LMP1 CTAR3-Ubc9 interaction revealed effects on cellular migration, a hallmark of oncogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that LMP1 CTAR3 does in fact function in intracellular signaling and leads to biological effects. We propose that LMP1, by interaction with Ubc9, modulates sumoylation processes, which regulate signal transduction pathways that affect phenotypic changes associated with oncogenesis.

9202023|t|Characterization of the WW domain of human yes-associated protein and its polyproline-containing ligands.
9202023|t|We had previously identified the WW domain as a novel globular domain that is composed of 38-40 semiconserved amino acids and is involved in mediating protein-protein interaction. The WW domain is shared by proteins of diverse functions including structural, regulatory, and signaling proteins in yeast, nematode, and mammals. Functionally it is similar to the Src homology 3 domain in that it binds polyproline ligands. By screening a 16-day mouse embryo expression library, we identified two putative ligands of the WW domain of Yes kinase-associated protein which we named WW domain-binding proteins 1 and 2. These proteins interacted with the WW domain via a short proline-rich motif with the consensus sequence of four consecutive prolines followed by a tyrosine. Herein, we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of the human orthologs of WW domain-binding proteins 1 and 2. The products encoded by these cDNA clones represent novel proteins with no known function. Furthermore, these proteins show no homology to each other except for a proline-rich motif. By fluorescence in situ hybridization on human metaphase chromosomes, we mapped the human genes for WW domain-binding proteins 1 and 2 to chromosomes 2p12 and 17q25, respectively. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined which residues in the WW domain of Yes kinase-associated protein are critical for binding. Finally, by synthesizing peptides in which the various positions of the four consecutive proline-tyrosine motif and the five surrounding residues were replaced by all possible amino acid residues, we further elucidated the binding requirements of this motif.

11278869|t|Identification of sperm-specific proteins that interact with A-kinase anchoring proteins in a manner similar to the type II regulatory subunit of PKA.
11278869|t|The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is targeted to specific subcellular compartments through its interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs contain an amphipathic helix domain that binds to the type II regulatory subunit of PKA (RII). Synthetic peptides containing this amphipathic helix domain bind to RII with high affinity and competitively inhibit the binding of PKA with AKAPs. Addition of these anchoring inhibitor peptides to spermatozoa inhibits motility (Vijayaraghavan, S., Goueli, S. A., Davey, M. P., and Carr, D. W. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4747-4752). However, inhibition of the PKA catalytic activity does not mimic these peptides, suggesting that the peptides are disrupting the interaction of AKAP(s) with proteins other than PKA. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have now identified two sperm-specific human proteins that interact with the amphipathic helix region of AKAP110. These proteins, ropporin (a protein previously shown to interact with the Rho signaling pathway) and AKAP-associated sperm protein, are 39% identical to each other and share a strong sequence similarity with the conserved domain on the N terminus of RII that is involved in dimerization and AKAP binding. Mutation of conserved residues in ropporin or RII prevents binding to AKAP110. These data suggest that sperm contains several proteins that bind to AKAPs in a manner similar to RII and imply that AKAPs may have additional and perhaps unique functions in spermatozoa.

21785459|t|DJ-1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking pro-caspase-8 recruitment to FADD.
21785459|t|DJ-1 was initially identified as an oncogene product involved in human tumorigenesis in cooperation with Ras. Increased DJ-1 expression is associated with tumorigenesis in many cancers, whereas the loss of DJ-1 function is linked to an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that DJ-1 protects cells from TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which DJ-1 is involved is still largely unknown. Here we show that DJ-1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking Fas-associated protein death domain (FADD)-mediated pro-caspase-8 activation. Wild-type DJ-1, but not the PD-associated mutant L166P, binds to FADD to inhibit the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DJ-1 competes with pro-caspase-8 to bind to FADD at the death effector domain, thereby repressing the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-8 to the active form of caspase-8. Thus, our study suggests that DJ-1 protects against TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the regulation of DISC formation.

16221672|t|ADAMTS13 substrate recognition of von Willebrand factor A2 domain.
16221672|t|ADAMTS13 controls the multimeric size of circulating von Willebrand factor (VWF) by cleaving the Tyr1605-Met1606 bond in theA2 domain. To examine substrate recognition, we expressed in bacteria and purified three A2 (VWF76-(1593-1668), VWF115-(1554-1668), VWFA2-(1473-1668)) and one A2-A3 (VWF115-A3-(1554-1874)) domain fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, the initial rates of VWF115 cleavage by ADAMTS13 at different substrate concentrations were determined, and from this the kinetic constants were derived (Km 1.61 microM; kcat 0.14 s(-1)), from which the specificity constant kcat/Km was calculated, 8.70 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). Similar values of the specificity constant were obtained for VWF76 and VWF115-A3. To identify residues important for recognition and proteolysis of VWF115, we introduced certain type 2A von Willebrand disease mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most were cleaved normally, one (D1614G) was cleaved approximately 8-fold slower. Mutagenesis of additional charged residues predicted to be in close proximity to Asp1614 on the surface of the A2 domain (R1583A, D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, K1617A, E1638A, E1640A) revealed up to 13-fold reduction in kcat/Km for D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, and K1617A mutants. When introduced into the intact VWFA2 domain, proteolysis of the D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A mutants was also slowed, particularly in the presence of urea. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated appreciable reduction in binding affinity between ADAMTS13 and VWF115 mutants (KD up to approximately 1.3 microM), compared with VWF115 (KD 20 nM). These results demonstrate an important role for Asp1614 and surrounding charged residues in the binding and cleavage of the VWFA2 domain by ADAMTS13.

22430200|t|A non-canonical UBA-UBL interaction forms the linear-ubiquitin-chain assembly complex.
22430200|t|HOIL-1L and its binding partner HOIP are essential components of the E3-ligase complex that generates linear ubiquitin (Ub) chains, which are critical regulators of NF-kB activation. Using crystallographic and mutational approaches, we characterize the unexpected structural basis for the specific interaction between the Ub-like domain (UBL) of HOIL-1L and the Ub-associated domain (UBA) of HOIP.

18162466|t|The phosphatase PHLPP controls the cellular levels of protein kinase C.
18162466|t|The life cycle of protein kinase C (PKC) is controlled by multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps. The maturation of PKC requires three ordered phosphorylations, one at the activation loop and two at COOH-terminal sites, the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif, to yield a stable and signaling-competent enzyme. Dephosphorylation of the enzyme leads to protein degradation. We have recently discovered a novel family of protein phosphatases named PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) whose members terminate Akt signaling by dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif on Akt. Here we show that the two PHLPP isoforms, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, also dephosphorylate the hydrophobic motif on PKC betaII, an event that shunts PKC to the detergent-insoluble fraction, effectively terminating its life cycle. Deletion mutagenesis reveals that the PH domain is necessary for the effective dephosphorylation of PKC betaII by PHLPP in cells, whereas the PDZ-binding motif, required for Akt regulation, is dispensable. The phorbol ester-mediated dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic site, but not the turn motif or activation loop, is insensitive to okadaic acid, consistent with PHLPP, a PP2C family member, controlling the hydrophobic site. In addition, knockdown of PHLPP expression reduces the rate of phorbol ester-triggered dephosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif, but not turn motif, of PKC alpha. Last, we show that depletion of PHLPP in colon cancer and normal breast epithelial cells results in an increase in conventional and novel PKC levels. These data reveal that PHLPP controls the cellular levels of PKC by specifically dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif, thus destabilizing the enzyme and promoting its degradation.

19395483|t|Characterization of the Escherichia coli ClpY (HslU) substrate recognition site in the ClpYQ (HslUV) protease using the yeast two-hybrid system.
19395483|t|In Escherichia coli, ClpYQ (HslUV) is a two-component ATP-dependent protease in which ClpQ is the peptidase subunit and ClpY is the ATPase and the substrate-binding subunit. The ATP-dependent proteolysis is mediated by substrate recognition in the ClpYQ complex. ClpY has three domains, N, I, and C, and these domains are discrete and exhibit different binding preferences. In vivo, ClpYQ targets SulA, RcsA, RpoH, and TraJ molecules. In this study, ClpY was analyzed to identify the molecular determinants required for the binding of its natural protein substrates. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we showed that domain I of ClpY contains the residues responsible for recognition of its natural substrates, while domain C is necessary to engage ClpQ. Moreover, the specific residues that lie in the amino acid (aa) 137 to 150 (loop 1) and aa 175 to 209 (loop 2) double loops in domain I of ClpY were shown to be necessary for natural substrate interaction. Additionally, the two-hybrid system, together with random PCR mutagenesis, allowed the isolation of ClpY mutants that displayed a range of binding activities with SulA, including a mutant with no SulA binding trait. Subsequently, via methyl methanesulfonate tests and cpsB::lacZ assays with, e.g., SulA and RcsA as targets, we concluded that aa 175 to 209 of loop 2 are involved in the tethering of natural substrates, and it is likely that both loops, aa 137 to 150 and aa 175 to 209, of ClpY domain I may assist in the delivery of substrates into the inner core for ultimate degradation by ClpQ.

21751375|t|Functional analysis of novel phosphorylation sites of CREB-binding protein using mass spectrometry and mammalian two-hybrid assays.
21751375|t|In the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) is recruited by nuclear b-catenin to regulate a wide array of T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent gene expression. Previous studies have indicated that CBP/b-catenin complex-mediated transcription is critical for cell proliferation. Both CBP and b-catenin are phosphoproteins. The interaction domain has been mapped to the N-terminal region of CBP (amino acids 1-111) and the C-terminal region of b-catenin, but it is unclear whether phosphorylation on specific residues of these regions is required for the interaction. To address this unmet challenge, phosphoproteomic profile of the critical N-terminus of CBP was determined by utilizing TiO(2) affinity chromatography followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Two unique and novel phosphorylation sites Ser77 and Ser92 were identified. Further studies aided by site-directed mutagenesis, immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assay have concluded that the phosphorylation of a Proline-directed Ser92 residue modulates the selective binding ability of CBP with b-catenin. The specific Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059, which promotes cell cycle G1 arrest, concomitantly inhibits the interaction, and the evidences suggest that the MEK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade activation is the upstream signal required for Ser92 phosphorylation, leading to enhancement of the interaction of CBP with b-catenin.

18226242|t|The histone chaperone protein Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (hNAP-1) binds HIV-1 Tat and promotes viral transcription.
18226242|t|BACKGROUND: Despite the large amount of data available on the molecular mechanisms that regulate HIV-1 transcription, crucial information is still lacking about the interplay between chromatin conformation and the events that regulate initiation and elongation of viral transcription. During transcriptional activation, histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes cooperate with histone chaperones in altering chromatin structure. In particular, human Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (hNAP-1) is known to act as a histone chaperone that shuttles histones H2A/H2B into the nucleus, assembles nucleosomes and promotes chromatin fluidity, thereby affecting transcription of several cellular genes. RESULTS: Using a proteomic screening, we identified hNAP-1 as a novel cellular protein interacting with HIV-1 Tat. We observed that Tat specifically binds hNAP1, but not other members of the same family of factors. Binding between the two proteins required the integrity of the basic domain of Tat and of two separable domains of hNAP-1 (aa 162-290 and 290-391). Overexpression of hNAP-1 significantly enhanced Tat-mediated activation of the LTR. Conversely, silencing of the protein decreased viral promoter activity. To explore the effects of hNAP-1 on viral infection, a reporter HIV-1 virus was used to infect cells in which hNAP-1 had been either overexpressed or knocked-down. Consistent with the gene expression results, these two treatments were found to increase and inhibit viral infection, respectively. Finally, we also observed that the overexpression of p300, a known co-activator of both Tat and hNAP-1, enhanced hNAP-1-mediated transcriptional activation as well as its interaction with Tat. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that HIV-1 Tat binds the histone chaperone hNAP-1 both in vitro and in vivo and shows that this interaction participates in the regulation of Tat-mediated activation of viral gene expression.

12861019|t|RNF5, a RING finger protein that regulates cell motility by targeting paxillin ubiquitination and altered localization.
12861019|t|RNF5 is a RING finger protein found to be important in the growth and development of Caenorhabditis elegans. The search for RNF5-associated proteins via a yeast two-hybrid screen identified a LIM-containing protein in C. elegans which shows homology with human paxillin. Here we demonstrate that the human homologue of RNF5 associates with the amino-terminal domain of paxillin, resulting in its ubiquitination. RNF5 requires intact RING and C-terminal domains to mediate paxillin ubiquitination. Whereas RNF5 mediates efficient ubiquitination of paxillin in vivo, protein extracts were required for in vitro ubiquitination, suggesting that additional modifications and/or an associated E3 ligase assist RNF5 targeting of paxillin ubiquitination. Mutant Ubc13 efficiently inhibits RNF5 ubiquitination, suggesting that RNF5 generates polychain ubiquitin of the K63 topology. Expression of RNF5 increases the cytoplasmic distribution of paxillin while decreasing its localization within focal adhesions, where it is primarily seen under normal growth. Concomitantly, RNF5 expression results in inhibition of cell motility. Via targeting of paxillin ubiquitination, which alters its localization, RNF5 emerges as a novel regulator of cell motility.

16762039|t|A L225A substitution in the human tumour suppressor HIC1 abolishes its interaction with the corepressor CtBP.
16762039|t|HIC1 (hypermethylated in cancer) is a tumour suppressor gene located in 17p13.3, a region frequently hypermethylated or deleted in many types of prevalent human tumour. HIC1 is also a candidate for a contiguous-gene syndrome, the Miller-Dieker syndrome, a severe form of lissencephaly accompanied by developmental anomalies. HIC1 encodes a BTB/POZ-zinc finger transcriptional repressor. HIC1 represses transcription via two autonomous repression domains, an N-terminal BTB/POZ and a central region, by trichostatin A-insensitive and trichostatin A-sensitive mechanisms, respectively. The HIC1 central region recruits the corepressor CtBP (C-terminal binding protein) through a conserved GLDLSKK motif, a variant of the consensus C-terminal binding protein interaction domain PxDLSxK/R. Here, we show that HIC1 interacts with both CtBP1 and CtBP2 and that this interaction is stimulated by agents increasing NADH levels. Furthermore, point mutation of two CtBP2 residues forming part of the structure of the recognition cleft for a PxDLS motif also ablates the interaction with a GxDLS motif. Conversely, in perfect agreement with the structural data and the universal conservation of this residue in all C-terminal binding protein-interacting motifs, mutation of the central leucine residue (leucine 225 in HIC1) abolishes the interaction between HIC1 and CtBP1 or CtBP2. As expected from the corepressor activity of CtBP, this mutation also impairs the HIC1-mediated transcriptional repression. These results thus demonstrate a strong conservation in the binding of C-terminal binding protein-interacting domains despite great variability in their amino acid sequences. Finally, this L225A point mutation could also provide useful knock-in animal models to study the role of the HIC1-CtBP interaction in tumorigenesis and in development.

24553140|t|A Crohn's disease variant in Atg16l1 enhances its degradation by caspase 3.
24553140|t|Crohn's disease is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can involve the entire digestive tract. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding a missense variant in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 (rs2241880, Thr300Ala) is strongly associated with the incidence of Crohn's disease. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effect of ATG16L1 deletion or deficiency; however, the molecular consequences of the Thr300Ala (T300A) variant remains unknown. Here we show that amino acids 296-299 constitute a caspase cleavage motif in ATG16L1 and that the T300A variant (T316A in mice) significantly increases ATG16L1 sensitization to caspase-3-mediated processing. We observed that death-receptor activation or starvation-induced metabolic stress in human and murine macrophages increased degradation of the T300A or T316A variants of ATG16L1, respectively, resulting in diminished autophagy. Knock-in mice harbouring the T316A variant showed defective clearance of the ileal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica and an elevated inflammatory cytokine response. In turn, deletion of the caspase-3-encoding gene, Casp3, or elimination of the caspase cleavage site by site-directed mutagenesis rescued starvation-induced autophagy and pathogen clearance, respectively. These findings demonstrate that caspase 3 activation in the presence of a common risk allele leads to accelerated degradation of ATG16L1, placing cellular stress, apoptotic stimuli and impaired autophagy in a unified pathway that predisposes to Crohn's disease.

21122069|t|Structure-cytotoxicity relationships in bovine seminal ribonuclease: new insights from heat and chemical denaturation studies on variants.
21122069|t|Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), a homodimeric protein displaying selective cytotoxicity towards tumor cells, is isolated as a mixture of two isoforms, a dimeric form in which the chains swap their N-termini, and an unswapped dimer. In the cytosolic reducing environment, the dimeric form in which the chains swap their N-termini is converted into a noncovalent dimer (termed NCD), in which the monomers remain intertwined through their N-terminal ends. The quaternary structure renders the reduced protein resistant to the ribonuclease inhibitor, a protein that binds most ribonucleases with very high affinity. On the other hand, upon selective reduction, the unswapped dimer is converted in two monomers, which are readily bound and inactivated by the ribonuclease inhibitor. On the basis of these considerations, it has been proposed that the cytotoxic activity of BS-RNase relies on the 3D structure and stability of its NCD derivative. Here, we report a comparison of the thermodynamic and chemical stability of the NCD form of BS-RNase with that of the monomeric derivative, together with an investigation of the thermal dissociation mechanism revealing the presence of a dimeric intermediate. In addition, we report that the replacement of of Arg80 by Ser significantly decreases the cytotoxic activity of BS-RNase and the stability of the NCD form with respect to the parent protein, but does not affect the ribonucleolytic activity or the dissociation mechanism. The data show the importance of Arg80 for the cytotoxicity of BS-RNase, and also support the hypothesis that the reduced derivative of BS-RNase is responsible for its cytotoxic activity.

23059983|t|Development of contact allergy requires cooperation of adaptive and innate immunity. Ni(2+) stimulates innate immunity via TLR4/MD2, the bacterial LPS receptor. This likely involves receptor dimerization, but direct proof is pending and it is unclear if related haptens share this mechanism.

Experiments with a new TLR4 dimerization mutant established dimerization as a mechanism of metal- and LPS-induced TLR4 activation. Yet, in interaction studies only LPS- but not metal-induced dimerization required MD2. Consistently, soluble TLR4 expressed without MD2 inhibited metal- but not LPS-induced responses, opening new therapeutic perspectives.

23892456|t|A direct physical interaction between Nanog and Sox2 regulates embryonic stem cell self-renewal.
23892456|t|Embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal efficiency is determined by the Nanog protein level. However, the protein partners of Nanog that function to direct self-renewal are unclear. Here, we identify a Nanog interactome of over 130 proteins including transcription factors, chromatin modifying complexes, phosphorylation and ubiquitination enzymes, basal transcriptional machinery members, and RNA processing factors. Sox2 was identified as a robust interacting partner of Nanog. The purified Nanog-Sox2 complex identified a DNA recognition sequence present in multiple overlapping Nanog/Sox2 ChIP-Seq data sets. The Nanog tryptophan repeat region is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Sox2, with tryptophan residues required. In Sox2, tyrosine to alanine mutations within a triple-repeat motif (S X T/S Y) abrogates the Nanog-Sox2 interaction, alters expression of genes associated with the Nanog-Sox2 cognate sequence, and reduces the ability of Sox2 to rescue ES cell differentiation induced by endogenous Sox2 deletion. Substitution of the tyrosines with phenylalanine rescues both the Sox2-Nanog interaction and efficient self-renewal. These results suggest that aromatic stacking of Nanog tryptophans and Sox2 tyrosines mediates an interaction central to ES cell self-renewal.

12044636|t|Analysis of synphilin-1 and synuclein interactions by yeast two-hybrid beta-galactosidase liquid assay.
12044636|t|Synphilin-1 interacts with alpha-synuclein, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). By examination of their interactions quantitatively, with the use of the yeast two-hybrid beta-galactosidase assay, we find that the synuclein amino acid (aa) 1-65 region is sufficient for an interaction. A central domain of synphilin-1, aa 349-555, is both necessary and sufficient for an interaction with alpha-synuclein. We did not observe an effect of the synuclein A53T mutation, which causes one familial form of PD, on interactions with synphilin-1. However, the A30P mutation caused an increase in the interaction between the synuclein aa 1-65 fragment and the synphilin-1 central domain.

12586840|t|Physical and functional interactions among AP-2 transcription factors, p300/CREB-binding protein, and CITED2.
12586840|t|The transcriptional co-activators and histone acetyltransferases p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) interact with CITED2, a transcription factor AP-2 (TFAP2) co-activator. p300/CBP, CITED2, and TFAP2A are essential for normal neural tube and cardiac development. Here we show that p300 and CBP co-activate TFAP2A in the presence of CITED2. TFAP2A transcriptional activity was modestly impaired in p300(+/-) and CBP(+/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts; this was rescued by ectopic expression of p300/CBP. p300, TFAP2A, and endogenous CITED2 could be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected U2-OS cells indicating that they can interact physically in vivo. CITED2 interacted with the dimerization domain of TFAP2C, which is highly conserved in TFAP2A/B. In mammalian two-hybrid experiments, full-length p300 and TFAP2A interacted only when CITED2 was co-transfected. N-terminal residues of TFAP2A, containing the transactivation domain, are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with p300, and this interaction was independent of CITED2. Consistent with this, N-terminal residues of TFAP2A were required for p300- and CITED2-dependent co-activation. A histone acetyltransferase-deficient p300 mutant (D1399Y) did not co-activate TFAP2A and did not affect the expression or cellular localization of TFAP2A or CITED2. In mammalian two-hybrid experiments p300D1399Y failed to interact with TFAP2A, explaining, at least in part, its failure to function as a co-activator. Our results suggest a model wherein interactions among TFAP2A, CITED2, and p300/CBP are necessary for TFAP2A-mediated transcriptional activation and for normal neural tube and cardiac development.

20644138|t|Mutagenesis of conserved amino acids of Helicobacter pylori fur reveals residues important for function.
20644138|t|The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) of the medically important pathogen Helicobacter pylori is unique in that it has been shown to function as a repressor both in the presence of an Fe2+ cofactor and in its apo (non-Fe2+-bound) form. However, virtually nothing is known concerning the amino acid residues that are important for Fur functioning. Therefore, mutations in six conserved amino acid residues of H. pylori Fur were constructed and analyzed for their impact on both iron-bound and apo repression. In addition, accumulation of the mutant proteins, protein secondary structure, DNA binding ability, iron binding capacity, and the ability to form higher-order structures were also examined for each mutant protein. While none of the mutated residues completely abrogated the function of Fur, we were able to identify residues that were critical for both iron-bound and apo-Fur repression. One mutation, V64A, did not alter regulation of any target genes. However, each of the five remaining mutations showed an effect on either iron-bound or apo regulation. Of these, H96A, E110A, and E117A mutations altered iron-bound Fur regulation and were all shown to influence iron binding to different extents. Additionally, the H96A mutation was shown to alter Fur oligomerization, and the E110A mutation was shown to impact oligomerization and DNA binding. Conversely, the H134A mutant exhibited changes in apo-Fur regulation that were the result of alterations in DNA binding. Although the E90A mutant exhibited alterations in apo-Fur regulation, this mutation did not affect any of the assessed protein functions. This study is the first for H. pylori to analyze the roles of specific amino acid residues of Fur in function and continues to highlight the complexity of Fur regulation in this organism.

21097510|t|DJ-1 enhances cell survival through the binding of Cezanne, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB.
21097510|t|Heightened DJ-1 (Park7) expression is associated with a reduction in chemotherapeutic-induced cell death and poor prognosis in several cancers, whereas the loss of DJ-1 function is found in a subgroup of Parkinson disease associated with neuronal death. This study describes a novel pathway by which DJ-1 modulates cell survival. Mass spectrometry shows that DJ-1 interacts with BBS1, CLCF1, MTREF, and Cezanne/OTUD7B/Za20d1. Among these, Cezanne is a known deubiquitination enzyme that inhibits NF-kB activity. DJ-1/Cezanne interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed and endogenous proteins, maps to the amino-terminal 70 residues of DJ-1, and leads to the inhibition of the deubiquitinating activity of Cezanne. Microarray profiling of shRNA-transduced cells shows that DJ-1 and Cezanne regulate IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression in opposing directions. Similarly, DJ-1 enhances NF-kB nuclear translocation and cell survival, whereas Cezanne reduces these outcomes. Analysis of mouse Park7(-/-) primary cells confirms the regulation of ICAM-1 by DJ-1 and Cezanne. As NF-kB is important in cellular survival and transformation, IL-8 functions as an angiogenic factor and pro-survival signal, and ICAM-1 has been implicated in tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis; these data provide an additional modality by which DJ-1 controls cell survival and possibly tumor progression via interaction with Cezanne.

24802387|t|The electrostatic interactions of relaxin-3 with receptor RXFP4 and the influence of its B-chain C-terminal conformation.
24802387|t|Relaxin-3 (also known as insulin-like peptide 7) is an insulin/relaxin-superfamily peptide hormone that can bind and activate three relaxin-family peptide receptors: RXFP3, RXFP4, and RXFP1. Recently, we identified key electrostatic interactions between relaxin-3 and its cognate receptor RXFP3 by using a charge-exchange mutagenesis approach. In the present study, the electrostatic interactions between relaxin-3 and RXFP4 were investigated with the same approach. Mutagenesis of the negatively charged extracellular residues of human RXFP4 identified a conserved EXXXD(100-104) motif that is essential for RXFP4 activation by relaxin-3. Mutagenesis of the conserved positively charged Arg residues of relaxin-3 demonstrated that B12Arg, B16Arg and B26Arg were all involved in the binding and activation of RXFP4, especially B26Arg. The activity complementation between the mutant ligands and the mutant receptors suggested two probable electrostatic interaction pairs: Glu100 of RXFP4 versus B26Arg of relaxin-3, and Asp104 of RXFP4 versus both B12Arg and B16Arg of relaxin-3. For interaction with the essential EXXXD motifs of both RXFP3 and RXFP4, a folding-back conformation of the relaxin-3 B-chain C-terminus seems to be critical, because it brings B26Arg sufficiently close to B12Arg and B16Arg. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the conserved B23Gly-B24Gly dipeptide of relaxin-3 with an Ala-Ser dipeptide that occupied the corresponding position of insulin-like peptide 5 and resulted in an extended helical conformation. The mutant relaxin-3 showed a significant decrease in receptor-activation potency towards both RXFP3 and RXFP4, suggesting that a folding-back conformation of the B-chain C-terminus was important for relaxin-3 to efficiently interact with the EXXXD motifs of both receptors.

11046132|t|Platelet-derived growth factor receptor association with Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor potentiates receptor activity.
11046132|t|Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for many cell types. The PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates the mitogenic effects of PDGF by binding to and/or phosphorylating a variety of intracellular signaling proteins upon PDGF-induced receptor dimerization. We show here that the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF; also known as EBP50), a protein not previously known to interact with the PDGFR, binds to the PDGFR carboxyl terminus (PDGFR-CT) with high affinity via a PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/Z0-1 homology) domain-mediated interaction and potentiates PDGFR autophosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in cells. A point-mutated version of the PDGFR, with the terminal leucine changed to alanine (L1106A), cannot bind NHERF in vitro and is markedly impaired relative to the wild-type receptor with regard to PDGF-induced autophosphorylation and activation of ERK in cells. NHERF potentiation of PDGFR signaling depends on the capacity of NHERF to oligomerize. NHERF oligomerizes in vitro when bound with PDGFR-CT, and a truncated version of the first NHERF PDZ domain that can bind PDGFR-CT but which does not oligomerize reduces PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity when transiently overexpressed in cells. PDGFR activity in cells can also be regulated in a NHERF-dependent fashion by stimulation of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, a known cellular binding partner for NHERF. These findings reveal that NHERF can directly bind to the PDGFR and potentiate PDGFR activity, thus elucidating both a novel mechanism by which PDGFR activity can be regulated and a new cellular role for the PDZ domain-containing adapter protein NHERF.

22363216|t|GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 is regulated by ArfGAP1.
22363216|t|Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and also contribute to idiopathic PD. LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity. ArfGAP1 may represent a promising target for interfering with LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD.

12445118|t|COI1 links jasmonate signalling and fertility to the SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex in Arabidopsis.
12445118|t|Jasmonates (JAs) regulate Arabidopsis thaliana wound and defence responses, pollen development, and stress-related growth inhibition. Significantly, each of these responses requires COI1, an F-box protein. Other F-box proteins interact with SKP1 and cullin proteins to form SCF complexes that selectively recruit regulatory proteins targeted for ubiquitination. To determine whether COI1 also functions in an SCF complex, we have characterized Arabidopsis proteins that bind to COI1. An Arabidopsis cDNA expression library was screened in yeast for clones that produce proteins which can bind to COI1. We recovered two SKP1 homologues and a histone deacetylase. The Arabidopsis F-box protein TIR1 interacted with SKP1 proteins, but not with the histone deacetylase. Mutant COI1 proteins revealed that the F-box is required for interaction with SKP1s, but that sequences in leucine-rich repeat domains are required for interaction with the histone deacetylase. Epitope-tagged COI1 was introduced into Arabidopsis plants and cell cultures. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction in planta of COI1 with SKP1-like proteins and histone deacetylase, and also indicated that COI1 interacted with cullin. These results suggest that COI1 forms an SCFCOI1 complex in vivo. COI1 is therefore expected to form a functional E3-type ubiquitin ligase in plants and to regulate expression of jasmonate responsive genes, possibly by targeted ubiquitination of a histone deacetylase.

25225338|t|Disease mutations in desmoplakin inhibit Cx43 membrane targeting mediated by desmoplakin-EB1 interactions.
25225338|t|Mechanisms by which microtubule plus ends interact with regions of cell-cell contact during tissue development and morphogenesis are not fully understood. We characterize a previously unreported interaction between the microtubule binding protein end-binding 1 (EB1) and the desmosomal protein desmoplakin (DP), and demonstrate that DP-EB1 interactions enable DP to modify microtubule organization and dynamics near sites of cell-cell contact. EB1 interacts with a region of the DP N terminus containing a hotspot for pathogenic mutations associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC). We show that a subset of AC mutations, in addition to a mutation associated with skin fragility/woolly hair syndrome, impair gap junction localization and function by misregulating DP-EB1 interactions and altering microtubule dynamics. This work identifies a novel function for a desmosomal protein in regulating microtubules that affect membrane targeting of gap junction components, and elucidates a mechanism by which DP mutations may contribute to the development of cardiac and cutaneous diseases.

16293620|t|Structural determinants for the binding of anthrax lethal factor to oligomeric protective antigen.
16293620|t|Anthrax lethal toxin assembles at the surface of mammalian cells when the lethal factor (LF) binds via its amino-terminal domain, LF(N), to oligomeric forms of activated protective antigen (PA). LF x PA complexes are then trafficked to acidified endosomes, where PA forms heptameric pores in the bounding membrane and LF translocates through these pores to the cytosol. We used enhanced peptide amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and directed mutagenesis to define the surface on LF(N) that interacts with PA. A continuous surface encompassing one face of LF(N) became protected from deuterium exchange when LF(N) was bound to a PA dimer. Directed mutational analysis demonstrated that residues within this surface on LF(N) interact with Lys-197 on two PA subunits simultaneously, thereby showing that LF(N) spans the PA subunit:subunit interface and explaining why heptameric PA binds a maximum of three LF(N) molecules. Our results elucidate the structural basis for anthrax lethal toxin assembly and may be useful in developing drugs to block toxin action.

19153231|t|Ebola virus protein VP35 impairs the function of interferon regulatory factor-activating kinases IKKepsilon and TBK-1.
19153231|t|The Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 protein antagonizes the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) response. We previously demonstrated that VP35 inhibits the virus-induced activation of the IFN-beta promoter by blocking the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor that is crucial for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta expression. Furthermore, VP35 blocks IFN-beta promoter activation induced by any of several components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5)-activated signaling pathways including RIG-I, IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1), and IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon). These results suggested that VP35 may target the IRF kinases TBK-1 and IKKepsilon. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments now demonstrate physical interactions of VP35 with IKKepsilon and TBK-1, and the use of an IKKepsilon deletion construct further demonstrates that the amino-terminal kinase domain of IKKepsilon is sufficient for interactions with either IRF-3 or VP35. In vitro, either IKKepsilon or TBK-1 phosphorylates not only IRF-3 but also VP35. Moreover, VP35 overexpression impairs IKKepsilon-IRF-3, IKKepsilon-IRF-7, and IKKepsilon-IPS-1 interactions. Finally, lysates from cells overexpressing IKKepsilon contain kinase activity that can phosphorylate IRF-3 in vitro. When VP35 is expressed in the IKKepsilon-expressing cells, this kinase activity is suppressed. These data suggest that VP35 exerts its IFN-antagonist function, at least in part, by blocking necessary interactions between the kinases IKKepsilon and TBK-1 and their normal interaction partners, including their substrates, IRF-3 and IRF-7.

12799422|t|Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CrkII adaptor protein modulates cell migration.
12799422|t|CrkII belongs to a family of adaptor proteins that become tyrosine phosphorylated after various stimuli. We examined the role of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation in fibronectin-induced cell migration. Overexpression of CrkII inhibited dephosphorylation of focal adhesion components such as p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130cas) and paxillin by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII was dephosphorylated by PTP1B both in vitro and in vivo, showing for the first time that PTP1B directly dephosphorylates CrkII. A CrkII mutant in which tyrosine residue 221 was substituted by phenylalanine (CrkII-Y221F) could not be tyrosine phosphorylated, and it showed significantly increased binding to p130cas and paxillin. Enhanced binding of CrkII to p130cas has been reported to promote cell migration. Nonphosphorylated CrkII-Y221F promoted HT1080 cell migration on fibronectin, whereas wild-type CrkII did not at moderate expression levels. Moreover, co-expression of CrkII and PTP1B promoted HT1080 cell migration on fibronectin and retained tyrosine phosphorylation and binding of p130cas to CrkII, whereas paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced. These findings support the concepts that CrkII binding activity is regulated by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and that tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII can downmodulate cell migration mediated by the focal adhesion kinase/p130cas pathway.

7935368|t|Characterization of an interaction between insulin receptor substrate 1 and the insulin receptor by using the two-hybrid system.
7935368|t|Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of the insulin receptor and has been implicated in insulin signaling. Although IRS-1 is thought to interact with the insulin receptor, the nature of the interaction has not been defined. In this study, we used the two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the interaction between human IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. We demonstrate that IRS-1 forms a specific complex with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor when both are expressed as hybrid proteins in yeast cells. We show that the interaction is strictly dependent upon receptor tyrosine kinase activity, since IRS-1 shows no interaction with a kinase-inactive receptor hybrid containing a mutated ATP-binding site. Furthermore, mutation of receptor tyrosine 960 to phenylalanine eliminates IRS-1 interaction in the two-hybrid assay. These data suggest that the interaction between IRS-1 and the receptor is direct and provide evidence that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved. Furthermore, we show that a 356-amino-acid region encompassed by amino acids 160 through 516 of IRS-1 is sufficient for interaction with the receptor in the two-hybrid assay. Lastly, in agreement with our findings for yeast cells, we show that the insulin receptor is unable to phosphorylate an IRS-1 protein containing a deletion of amino acids 45 to 516 when expressed in COS cells. The two-hybrid assay should provide a facile means by which to pursue a detailed understanding of this interaction.

17721446|t|Rad9 BRCT domain interaction with phosphorylated H2AX regulates the G1 checkpoint in budding yeast.
17721446|t|Phosphorylation of histone H2A or H2AX is an early and sensitive marker of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells, although mutation of the conserved damage-dependent phosphorylation site is well tolerated. Here, we show that H2A phosphorylation is required for cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage at the G1/S transition in budding yeast. Furthermore, we show that the tandem BRCT domain of Rad9 interacts directly with phosphorylated H2A in vitro and that a rad9 point mutation that abolishes this interaction results in in vivo phenotypes that are similar to those caused by an H2A phosphorylation site mutation. Remarkably, similar checkpoint defects are also caused by a Rad9 Tudor domain mutation that impairs Rad9 chromatin association already in undamaged cells. These findings indicate that constitutive Tudor domain-mediated and damage-specific BRCT domain-phospho-H2A-dependent interactions of Rad9 with chromatin cooperate to establish G1 checkpoint arrest.

22555612|t|SUMOylation of Blimp-1 is critical for plasma cell differentiation.
22555612|t|Transcriptional repressor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) is a master regulator of plasma cell differentiation. Here we show that Blimp-1 is covalently modified by SUMO1 at lysine 816, a modification mediated by SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1. Mutation of Blimp-1 lysine 816 reduces transcriptional repression--correlating with a reduced interaction with a histone deacetylase, HDAC2--and impairs differentiation of antibody-secreting cells. Thus, the SUMO pathway critically regulates Blimp-1 function during plasma cell differentiation.

10413501|t|Superadditive and subadditive effects of "hot spot" mutations within the interfaces of placental ribonuclease inhibitor with angiogenin and ribonuclease A.
10413501|t|Previous single-site mutagenesis studies on the complexes of ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) with angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A suggested that in both cases a substantial fraction of the binding energy is concentrated within one small part of the crystallographically observed interface, involving RI residues 434-438. Such energetic "hot spots" are common in protein-protein complexes, but their physical meaning is generally unclear. Here we have investigated this question by examining the detailed interactions within the RI.ligand hot spots and the extent to which they function independently. The effects of Phe versus Ala substitutions show that the key residue Tyr434 interacts with both ligands primarily through its phenyl ring; for Tyr437, the OH group forms the important contacts with RNase A, whereas the phenyl group interacts with Ang. Kinetic characterization of complexes containing multiple substitutions reveals striking, but distinctive, cooperativity in the interactions of RI with the two ligands. The losses in binding energy for the RNase complex associated with replacements of Tyr434 and Asp435, and Tyr434 and Tyr437, are markedly less than additive (i.e., by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively). In contrast, the energetic effects of the 434 and 435, and 434 and 437, substitution pairs on binding of Ang are fully additive and 2.5 kcal/mol beyond additive, respectively. Superadditivities (0.9-2.4 kcal/mol) are also observed for several multisite replacements involving these inhibitor residues and two Ang residues, Arg5 and Lys40, from this part of the interface. Consequently, the decreases in binding energy for some triple-variant complexes are as large as 8.5-10.1 kcal/mol (compared to a total DeltaG of -21.0 kcal/mol for the wild-type complex). Potential explanations for these functional couplings, many of which occur over distances of >13 A and are not mediated by direct or triangulated contacts, are proposed. These findings show that the basis for the generation of hot spots can be complex, and that these sites can assume significantly more (as with Ang) or less (as with RNase) importance than indicated from the effects of single-site mutations.

15020601|t|Cryopyrin-induced interleukin 1beta secretion in monocytic cells: enhanced activity of disease-associated mutants and requirement for ASC.
15020601|t|Several autoinflammatory disorders are associated with missense mutations within the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain of cryopyrin. The mechanism by which cryopyrin mutations cause inflammatory disease remains elusive. To understand the molecular bases of these diseases, we generated constructs to express three common cryopyrin disease-associated mutations, R260W, D303N, and E637G, and compared their activity with that of the wild-type protein. All cryopyrin mutant proteins tested were found to induce potent NF-kappaB activity when compared with the wild-type protein. This activation was dependent on the expression of ASC, an adaptor protein previously suggested to mediate cryopyrin signaling. When the disease-associated mutants were expressed in monocytic THP-1 cells (which express endogenous ASC), each induced spontaneous IL-1beta secretion, whereas wild-type protein did not. In the absence of stimuli, wild-type cryopyrin was unable to bind to ASC, whereas the three mutants coimmunoprecipitated with ASC, suggesting a mechanism involved in the constitutive activation of mutant proteins. The induction of cryopyrin activity by enforced oligomerization in THP-1 cells resulted in ASC binding and the secretion of IL-1beta, an effect that was abolished by the inhibition of ASC expression with small interfering RNAs. Thus, cryopyrin-mediated IL-1beta secretion requires ASC in monocytic cells. Further, these results indicate that cryopyrin disease-associated mutants are constitutively active and able to induce NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta secretion at least in part by an increased ability to interact with ASC.

17909018|t|A CDKN2A mutation in familial melanoma that abrogates binding of p16INK4a to CDK4 but not CDK6.
17909018|t|The CDKN2A locus encodes two distinct proteins, p16INK4a and p14ARF, both of which are implicated in replicative senescence and tumor suppression in different contexts. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel strain of human diploid fibroblasts (designated Milan HDFs) from an individual who is homozygous for the R24P mutation in p16INK4a. As this mutation occurs in the first exon of INK4a (exon 1alpha), it has no effect on the primary sequence of p14(ARF). Based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the R24P variant is specifically defective for binding to CDK4 but remains able to associate with CDK6. Nevertheless, Milan HDFs behave as if they are p16INK4a deficient, in terms of sensitivity to spontaneous and oncogene-induced senescence, and the R24P variant has little effect on proliferation when ectopically expressed in normal fibroblasts. It can, however, impair the proliferation of U20S cells, presumably because they express more CDK6 than primary fibroblasts. These observations suggest that CDK4 and CDK6 are not functionally redundant and underscore the importance of CDK4 in the development of melanoma.

18571510|t|NPR1 preferentially binds to the DNA-inactive form of Arabidopsis TGA2.
18571510|t|Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is triggered by hormone defense cues and is associated with the onset of expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes that encode for anti-microbial proteins in plants. In the case of PR-1, transcriptional activation involves promoter-specific recruitment of transcription factors such as TGA2 through a mechanism that may involve transient physical interaction with the NPR1 protein. This stimulus-inducible recruitment process has yet to be fully explained at the functional and mechanistic level. To investigate this question further, we initially looked to see whether NPR1 preferentially forms a complex with the DNA bound or unbound fraction of TGA2. As shown here, NPR1 appears to preferentially interact with the non-DNA bound fraction of TGA2. We subsequently mutated this transcription factor to identify key residues in its conserved carboxyl terminal (CT) domain that mediate complex formation with NPR1. These approaches revealed that two non-overlapping regions of the CT domain of TGA2 bind independently to NPR1. The specificity and biological significance of these findings were inferred with a mutant form of NPR1 that fails to activate SAR in vivo. These and other findings raise the possibility that NPR1 may transiently interact with the DNA unbound fraction of TGA2 to promote its recruitment to an active form on cognate target promoters.

16488394|t|WASP suppresses the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae las17Delta strain in the presence of WIP.
16488394|t|Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by alterations in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and several of these mutations affect WASP's interaction with WIP (WASP-interacting protein), suggesting that loss of interaction between WASP and WIP is causal to the disease. Las17p is the yeast homologue of WASP and las17Delta strain is unable to grow at 37 degrees C. We show that Human WASP suppresses the growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae las17Delta strain, only in the presence of WIP. WIP mediates cortical localisation of WASP as well as stabilise WASP in yeast cells. Mutations which affected WASP-WIP interaction abolished WASP's ability to suppress the growth defect of las17Delta strain. We have demonstrated that WASP-WIP is an active complex and WASP's ability to suppress the growth defect of las17Delta strain is dependent on the presence of a functional Arp2/3 activating domain of WASP and also the Verprolin domain (V) of WIP.

20360685|t|AIF promotes chromatinolysis and caspase-independent programmed necrosis by interacting with histone H2AX.
20360685|t|Programmed necrosis induced by DNA alkylating agents, such as MNNG, is a caspase-independent mode of cell death mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). After poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, calpain, and Bax activation, AIF moves from the mitochondria to the nucleus where it induces chromatinolysis and cell death. The mechanisms underlying the nuclear action of AIF are, however, largely unknown. We show here that, through its C-terminal proline-rich binding domain (PBD, residues 543-559), AIF associates in the nucleus with histone H2AX. This interaction regulates chromatinolysis and programmed necrosis by generating an active DNA-degrading complex with cyclophilin A (CypA). Deletion or directed mutagenesis in the AIF C-terminal PBD abolishes AIF/H2AX interaction and AIF-mediated chromatinolysis. H2AX genetic ablation or CypA downregulation confers resistance to programmed necrosis. AIF fails to induce chromatinolysis in H2AX or CypA-deficient nuclei. We also establish that H2AX is phosphorylated at Ser139 after MNNG treatment and that this phosphorylation is critical for caspase-independent programmed necrosis. Overall, our data shed new light in the mechanisms regulating programmed necrosis, elucidate a key nuclear partner of AIF, and uncover an AIF apoptogenic motif.

19625296|t|Mutations in the LRRK2 Roc-COR tandem domain link Parkinson's disease to Wnt signalling pathways.
19625296|t|Mutations in PARK8, encoding LRRK2, are the most common known cause of Parkinson's disease. The LRRK2 Roc-COR tandem domain exhibits GTPase activity controlling LRRK2 kinase activity via an intramolecular process. We report the interaction of LRRK2 with the dishevelled family of phosphoproteins (DVL1-3), key regulators of Wnt (Wingless/Int) signalling pathways important for axon guidance, synapse formation and neuronal maintenance. Interestingly, DVLs can interact with and mediate the activation of small GTPases with structural similarity to the LRRK2 Roc domain. The LRRK2 Roc-COR domain and the DVL1 DEP domain were necessary and sufficient for LRRK2-DVL1 interaction. Co-expression of DVL1 increased LRRK2 steady-state protein levels, an effect that was dependent on the DEP domain. Strikingly, LRRK2-DVL1-3 interactions were disrupted by the familial PARK8 mutation Y1699C, whereas pathogenic mutations at residues R1441 and R1728 strengthened LRRK2-DVL1 interactions. Co-expression of DVL1 with LRRK2 in mammalian cells resulted in the redistribution of LRRK2 to typical cytoplasmic DVL1 aggregates in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells and co-localization in neurites and growth cones of differentiated dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. This is the first report of the modulation of a key LRRK2-accessory protein interaction by PARK8 Roc-COR domain mutations segregating with Parkinson's disease. Since the DVL1 DEP domain is known to be involved in the regulation of small GTPases, we propose that: (i) DVLs may influence LRRK2 GTPase activity, and (ii) Roc-COR domain mutations modulating LRRK2-DVL interactions indirectly influence kinase activity. Our findings also link LRRK2 to Wnt signalling pathways, suggesting novel pathogenic mechanisms and new targets for genetic analysis in Parkinson's disease.

9428767|t|Interaction of a G-protein beta-subunit with a conserved sequence in Ste20/PAK family protein kinases.
9428767|t|Serine/threonine protein kinases of the Ste20/PAK family have been implicated in the signalling from heterotrimeric G proteins to mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste20 is involved in transmitting the mating-pheromone signal from the betagamma-subunits (encoded by the STE4 and STE18 genes, respectively) of a heterotrimeric G protein to a downstream MAP kinase cascade. We have identified a binding site for the G-protein beta-subunit (Gbeta) in the non-catalytic carboxy-terminal regions of Ste20 and its mammalian homologues, the p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs). Association of Gbeta with this site in Ste20 was regulated by binding of pheromone to the receptor. Mutations in Gbeta and Ste20 that prevented this association blocked activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Considering the high degree of structural and functional conservation of Ste20/PAK family members and G-protein subunits, our results provide a possible model for a role of these kinases in Gbetagamma-mediated signal transduction in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.

11018522|t|We have identified the multiple PDZ domain containing protein (MUPP-1 or MPDZ) as a novel binding partner of the human c-Kit. c-Kit binds specifically to the 10th PDZ domain of MUPP-1 via its C-terminal sequence. Furthermore, a kinase negative-mutant receptor interacted more strongly with MUPP-1 than the wild-type c-Kit. Strikingly, a constitutively activated c-Kit (D816V-Kit) did not bind to MUPP-1, although this oncogenic form retains the PDZ binding motif 'HDDV' at the C-terminal end. Deletion of V967 of c-Kit abolished binding to MUPP-1 and drastically reduced its tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the structure of the C-terminal tail of c-Kit influences its enzymatic activity.

Five conserved proteins for centriole duplication have been identified. Two of them, SAS-5 and SAS-6, physically interact with each other and are codependent for their targeting to procentrioles. However, it remains unclear how these two proteins interact at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that the short SAS-5 C-terminal domain (residues 390-404) specifically binds to a narrow central region (residues 275-288) of the SAS-6 coiled coil. This was supported by the crystal structure of the SAS-6 coiled-coil domain (CCD), which, together with mutagenesis studies, indicated that the association is mediated by synergistic hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The crystal structure also shows a periodic charge pattern along the SAS-6 CCD, which gives rise to an anti-parallel tetramer. Overall, our findings establish the molecular basis of the specific interaction between SAS-5 and SAS-6, and suggest that both proteins individually adopt an oligomeric conformation that is disrupted upon the formation of the hetero-complex to facilitate the correct assembly of the nine-fold symmetric centriole.

10722738|t|cAMP-independent activation of the adenovirus type 12 E2 promoter correlates with the recruitment of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A(12S), and CBP to the E2-CRE.
10722738|t|Expression of the transcription unit early region 2 (E2) is of crucial importance for adenoviruses because this region encodes proteins essential for viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that the E1A(12S) protein of the oncogenic adenovirus serotype 12 activates the E2 promoter in dependence of the N terminus and the conserved region 1. Activation is mediated through a cAMP-response element that is bound by CREB-1 and ATF-1. Moreover, the Ad12 E2 promoter is inducible by protein kinase A and repressed by either a dominant-negative cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant or the highly specific protein kinase A inhibitor protein underscoring the participation of CREB-1/ATF-1 in promoter activation. E1A(12S) binds to CREB-1 and ATF-1 in dependence of the N terminus and CR1 and is recruited to the E2 cAMP-response element through both cellular transcription factors. Most interestingly, point mutations revealed that E1A(12S) domains essential for binding to CREB-1/ATF-1 and for activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter are also essential for binding to the CREB-binding protein. Due to these data and results obtained in DNA-dependent protein-protein interaction assays, we propose a model in which the cAMP-independent activation of the Ad12 E2 promoter is mediated through a ternary complex consisting of CREB-1/ATF-1, E1A(12S), and CREB-binding protein, which assembles on the E2 cAMP-response element.

15156152|t|Myosin-X provides a motor-based link between integrins and the cytoskeleton.
15156152|t|Unconventional myosins are actin-based motors with a growing number of attributed functions. Interestingly, it has been proposed that integrins are transported by unidentified myosins to facilitate cellular remodelling. Here we present an interaction between the unconventional myosin-X (Myo10) FERM (band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain and an NPXY motif within beta-integrin cytoplasmic domains. Importantly, knock-down of Myo10 by short interfering RNA impaired integrin function in cell adhesion, whereas overexpression of Myo10 stimulated the formation and elongation of filopodia in an integrin-dependent manner and relocalized integrins together with Myo10 to the tips of filopodia. This integrin relocalization and filopodia elongation did not occur with Myo10 mutants deficient in integrin binding or with a beta(1)-integrin point mutant deficient in Myo10 binding. Taken together, these results indicate that Myo10-mediated relocalization of integrins might serve to form adhesive structures and thereby promote filopodial extension.

14508515|t|Menin, a tumor suppressor, associates with nonmuscle myosin II-A heavy chain.
14508515|t|MEN1 is a likely tumor suppressor gene that encodes a novel protein, menin. Menin is a 610 amino-acid residue protein with as yet unknown function(s). We have used tandem affinity purification and mass spectroscopy to isolate and identify proteins associating with menin from cultured HeLa cell extracts. This strategy has resulted in the isolation and identification of nonmuscle myosin type II-A heavy chain (NMHC II-A) as a menin interacting protein. This interaction was confirmed by glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays, by coimmunoprecipitation, and by actin selection of myosin. We have further identified the amino-terminal region of menin and the head domain of NMHC II-A to be regions required for this interaction. Moreover menin was seen to colocalize with this myosin isoform in the cleavage furrow of dividing cells by indirect immunofluoresence. These data indicate that menin through binding to NMHC II-A could participate in cell division and in other processes that involve NMHC II-A.

9425168|t|Identification of p130Cas as a mediator of focal adhesion kinase-promoted cell migration.
9425168|t|Previously we have demonstrated that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-promoted migration on fibronectin (FN) by its overexpression in CHO cells is dependent on FAK autophosphorylation at Y397 and subsequent binding of Src to this site. In this report, we have examined the role of FAK association with Grb2 and p130(Cas), two downstream events of the FAK/Src complex that could mediate integrin-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks). We show that a Y925F FAK mutant was able to promote cell migration as efficiently as FAK and that the transfected FAK demonstrated no detectable association with Grb2 in CHO cells. In contrast, cells expressing a FAK P712/715A mutant demonstrated a level of migration comparable to that of control cells. This mutation did not affect FAK kinase activity, autophosphorylation, or Src association but did significantly reduce p130(Cas) association with FAK. Furthermore, FAK expression in CHO cells increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130(Cas) and its subsequent binding to several SH2 domains, which depended on both the p130(Cas) binding site and the Src binding site. However, we did not detect increased activation of Erks in cells expressing FAK, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not decrease FAK-promoted cell migration. Finally, we show that coexpression of p130(Cas) further increased cell migration on FN and coexpression of the p130(Cas) SH3 domain alone functioned as a dominant negative mutant and decreased cell migration. Together, these results demonstrate that p130(Cas), but not Grb2, is a mediator of FAK-promoted cell migration and suggest that FAK/ p130(Cas) complex targets downstream pathways other than Erks in mediating FAK-promoted cell migration.

9025305|t|Characterization of proteins that interact with the GTP-bound form of the regulatory GTPase Ran in Arabidopsis.
9025305|t|Ran, a small soluble GTP-binding protein, has been shown to be essential for the nuclear translocation of proteins and it is also thought to be involved in regulating cell cycle progression in mammalian and yeast cells. Genes encoding Ran-like proteins have been isolated from different higher plant species. Overexpression of plant Ran cDNAs, similarly to their mammalian/yeast homologues, suppresses the phenotype of the pim46-1 cell cycle mutant in yeast cells. The mammalian/yeast Ran proteins have been shown to interact with a battery of Ran-binding proteins, including the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1, the GTPase-activating Ran-GAP, nucleoporins and other Ran-binding proteins (RanBPs) specific for Ran-GTP. Here, the characterization of the first Ran-binding proteins from higher plants is reported. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding proteins of approximately 28 kDa (At-RanBP1a, At-RanBP1b) that interact with the GTP-bound forms of the Ran1, Ran2 and Ran3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced amino acid sequences of the At-RanBP1s display high similarity (60%) to mammalian/yeast RanBP1 proteins and contain the characteristic Ran-binding domains. Furthermore, interaction of the plant Ran and RanBP1 proteins, is shown to require the acidic C-terminal domain (-DEDDDL) of Ran proteins in addition to the presence of an intact Ran-binding domain. In whole cell extracts, the GST-RanBP1a fusion protein binds specifically to GTP-Ran and will not interact with Rab/Ypt-type small GTP-binding proteins. Finally, in good agreement with their proposed biological function, the At-Ran and the At-RanBP genes are expressed coordinately and show the highest level of expression in meristematic tissues.

22001206|t|Role of a propeller loop in the quaternary structure and enzymatic activity of prolyl dipeptidases DPP-IV and DPP9.
22001206|t|The dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) family members, including DPP-IV, DPP8, DPP9 and others, cleave the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue and are drug target rich. The dimerization of DPP-IV is required for its activity. A propeller loop located at the dimer interface is highly conserved within the family. Here we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on the loop of DPPIV and identified several residues important for dimer formation and enzymatic activity. Interestingly, the corresponding residues on DPP9 have a different impact whereby the mutations decrease activity without changing dimerization. Thus the propeller loop seems to play a varying role in different DPPs.

21292163|t|Structural basis for dimerization and activity of human PAPD1, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase.
21292163|t|Poly(A) polymerases (PAPs) are found in most living organisms and have important roles in RNA function and metabolism. Here, we report the crystal structure of human PAPD1, a noncanonical PAP that can polyadenylate RNAs in the mitochondria (also known as mtPAP) and oligouridylate histone mRNAs (TUTase1). The overall structure of the palm and fingers domains is similar to that in the canonical PAPs. The active site is located at the interface between the two domains, with a large pocket that can accommodate the substrates. The structure reveals the presence of a previously unrecognized domain in the N-terminal region of PAPD1, with a backbone fold that is similar to that of RNP-type RNA binding domains. This domain (named the RL domain), together with a b-arm insertion in the palm domain, contributes to dimerization of PAPD1. Surprisingly, our mutagenesis and biochemical studies show that dimerization is required for the catalytic activity of PAPD1.

25616961|t|ALS-linked mutations in ubiquilin-2 or hnRNPA1 reduce interaction between ubiquilin-2 and hnRNPA1.
25616961|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in UBQLN2 and some members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family cause ALS. Most mutations in UBQLN2 are missense mutations that occur in and around a PXX repeat motif located in the central domain of the encoded protein. However, neither the function of the PXX motif nor the mechanism by which mutations in UBQLN2 cause ALS is known. We screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the central domain of ubiquilin-2 hoping to identify proteins whose binding is affected by the UBQLN2 mutations. Three such interactors were identified-hnRNPA1, hnRNPA3 and hnRNPU-all members of the hnRNP family. The interacting region in each of these proteins was their glycine-rich domain, the domain most frequently mutated in hnRNP-related proteins that cause ALS. We focused on hnRNPA1, because a mutation in the protein causes ALS. We confirmed the interaction between wild-type (WT) ubiquilin-2 and hnRNPA1 proteins in vitro and in cells. In contrast, all five ALS mutations in ubiquilin-2 that we examined had reduced binding with WT hnRNPA1. In addition, hnRNPA1 carrying the D262V missense mutation that causes ALS failed to bind WT ubiquilin-2. Overexpression of ubiquilin-2 containing the ALS mutations increased cell death and, for several of the mutants, this correlated with increased translocation of hnRNPA1 to the cytoplasm. Knockdown of ubiquilin-2 led to increased turnover of hnRNPA1, indicating ubiquilin-2 functions to stabilize hnRNPA1. The discovery that ubiquilin-2 interacts with hnRNP proteins and that mutation in either protein disrupts interaction suggests a connection between proteostasis and RNA metabolism.

11375976|t|Telomeric protein Pin2/TRF1 as an important ATM target in response to double strand DNA breaks.
11375976|t|ATM mutations are responsible for the genetic disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). ATM encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation-induced double strand DNA breaks. Cells derived from A-T patients show many abnormalities, including accelerated telomere loss and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation; they enter into mitosis and apoptosis after DNA damage. Pin2 was originally identified as a protein involved in G(2)/M regulation and is almost identical to TRF1, a telomeric protein that negatively regulates telomere elongation. Pin2 and TRF1, probably encoded by the same gene, PIN2/TRF1, are regulated during the cell cycle. Furthermore, up-regulation of Pin2 or TRF1 induces mitotic entry and apoptosis, a phenotype similar to that of A-T cells after DNA damage. These results suggest that ATM may regulate the function of Pin2/TRF1, but their exact relationship remains unknown. Here we show that Pin2/TRF1 coimmunoprecipitated with ATM, and its phosphorylation was increased in an ATM-dependent manner by ionizing DNA damage. Furthermore, activated ATM directly phosphorylated Pin2/TRF1 preferentially on the conserved Ser(219)-Gln site in vitro and in vivo. The biological significance of this phosphorylation is substantiated by functional analyses of the phosphorylation site mutants. Although expression of Pin2 and its mutants has no detectable effect on telomere length in transient transfection, a Pin2 mutant refractory to ATM phosphorylation on Ser(219) potently induces mitotic entry and apoptosis and increases radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. In contrast, Pin2 mutants mimicking ATM phosphorylation on Ser(219) completely fail to induce apoptosis and also reduce radiation hypersensitivity of A-T cells. Interestingly, the phenotype of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutants is the same as that which resulted from inhibition of endogenous Pin2/TRF1 in A-T cells by its dominant-negative mutants. These results demonstrate for the first time that ATM interacts with and phosphorylates Pin2/TRF1 and suggest that Pin2/TRF1 may be involved in the cellular response to double strand DNA breaks.

10747027|t|The structure of mouse HP1 suggests a unique mode of single peptide recognition by the shadow chromo domain dimer.
10747027|t|The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins is involved in gene silencing via the formation of heterochromatic structures. They are composed of two related domains: an N-terminal chromo domain and a C-terminal shadow chromo domain. Present results suggest that chromo domains may function as protein interaction motifs, bringing together different proteins in multi-protein complexes and locating them in heterochromatin. We have previously determined the structure of the chromo domain from the mouse HP1beta protein, MOD1. We show here that, in contrast to the chromo domain, the shadow chromo domain is a homodimer. The intact HP1beta protein is also dimeric, where the interaction is mediated by the shadow chromo domain, with the chromo domains moving independently of each other at the end of flexible linkers. Mapping studies, with fragments of the CAF1 and TIF1beta proteins, show that an intact, dimeric, shadow chromo domain structure is required for complex formation.

21320496|t|Identification and functional analysis of a new phosphorylation site (Y398) in the SH3 domain of Abi-1.
21320496|t|Abi-1 is an adaptor protein for Abelson kinase (c-Abl), and Abi-1 promotes the Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Mammalian Enabled (Mena) by binding both c-Abl and Mena. Here, we identified a new phosphorylation site (Y398) in the SH3 domain of Abi-1, and disruption of Y398, combined with the previously identified phosphorylation site Y213, significantly weakens the binding of Abi-1 to c-Abl. The SH3 domain of Abi-1 and the proline-rich domain of c-Abl are involved in this interaction. Abi-1 phosphorylation at both sites stimulates the phosphorylation of Mena through the activation of c-Abl kinase. The phosphorylation of Abi-1 also plays a role in enhancing the adhesion of Bcr-Abl-transformed leukemic cells.

22014570|t|FoxM1 promotes b-catenin nuclear localization and controls Wnt target-gene expression and glioma tumorigenesis.
22014570|t|Wnt/b-catenin signaling is essential for stem cell regulation and tumorigenesis, but its molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we report that FoxM1 is a downstream component of Wnt signaling and is critical for b-catenin transcriptional function in tumor cells. Wnt3a increases the level and nuclear translocation of FoxM1, which binds directly to b-catenin and enhances b-catenin nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Genetic deletion of FoxM1 in immortalized neural stem cells abolishes b-catenin nuclear localization. FoxM1 mutations that disrupt the FoxM1-b-catenin interaction or FoxM1 nuclear import prevent b-catenin nuclear accumulation in tumor cells. FoxM1-b-catenin interaction controls Wnt target gene expression, is required for glioma formation, and represents a mechanism for canonical Wnt signaling during tumorigenesis.

10846174|t|Disruption of the CED-9.CED-4 complex by EGL-1 is a critical step for programmed cell death in Caenorhabditis elegans.
10846174|t|In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the apoptotic machinery is composed of four basic elements: the caspase CED-3, the Apaf-1 homologue CED-4, and the Bcl-2 family members CED-9 and EGL-1. The ced-9(n1950) gain-of-function mutation prevents most, if not all, somatic cell deaths in C. elegans. It encodes a CED-9 protein with a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at position 169, which is located within the highly conserved Bcl-2 homology 1 domain. We performed biochemical analyses with the CED-9G169E protein to gain insight into the mechanism of programmed cell death. We find that CED-9G169E retains the ability to bind both EGL-1 and CED-4, although its affinity for EGL-1 is reduced. In contrast to the behavior of wild-type CED-9, the interaction between CED-9G169E and CED-4 is not disrupted by expression of EGL-1. Furthermore, CED-4 and CED-9G169E co-localizes with EGL-1 to the mitochondria in mammalian cells, and expression of EGL-1 does not induce translocation of CED-4 to the cytosol. Finally, the ability of EGL-1 to promote apoptosis is impaired by the replacement of wild-type CED-9 with CED-9G169E, and this effect is correlated with the inability of EGL-1 to induce the displacement of CED-4 from the CED-9.CED-4 complex. These studies suggest that the release of CED-4 from the CED-9.CED-4 complex is a necessary step for induction of programmed cell death in C. elegans.

16628218|t|Phospholipase Cgamma/diacylglycerol-dependent activation of beta2-chimaerin restricts EGF-induced Rac signaling.
16628218|t|Although receptor-mediated regulation of small G-proteins and the cytoskeleton is intensively studied, the mechanisms for attenuation of these signals are poorly understood. In this study, we have identified the Rac-GAP beta2-chimaerin as an effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via coupling to phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) and generation of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). EGF redistributes beta2-chimaerin to promote its association with the small GTPase Rac1 at the plasma membrane, as determined by FRET. This relocalization and association with Rac1 were impaired by disruption of the beta2-chimaerin C1 domain as well as by PLCgamma1 RNAi, thus defining beta2-chimaerin as a novel DAG effector. On the other hand, GAP-deficient beta2-chimaerin mutants show enhanced translocation and sustained Rac1 association in the FRET assays. Remarkably, RNAi depletion of beta2-chimaerin significantly extended the duration of Rac activation by EGF, suggesting that beta2-chimaerin serves as a mechanism that self-limits Rac activity in response to EGFR activation. Our results represent the first direct evidence of divergence in DAG signaling downstream of a tyrosine-kinase receptor via a PKC-independent mechanism.

10409688|t|The Cap-binding protein eIF4E promotes folding of a functional domain of yeast translation initiation factor eIF4G1.
10409688|t|The association of eucaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4G with the cap-binding protein eIF4E establishes a critical link between the mRNA and the ribosome during translation initiation. This association requires a conserved seven amino acid peptide within eIF4G that binds to eIF4E. Here we report that a 98-amino acid fragment of S. cerevisiae eIF4G1 that contains this eIF4E binding peptide undergoes an unfolded to folded transition upon binding to eIF4E. The folding of the eIF4G1 domain was evidenced by the eIF4E-dependent changes in its protease sensitivity and (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectrum. Analysis of a series of charge-to-alanine mutations throughout the essential 55.4-kDa core of yeast eIF4G1 also revealed substitutions within this 98-amino acid region that led to reduced eIF4E binding in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that the association of yeast eIF4E with eIF4G1 leads to the formation of a structured domain within eIF4G1 that could serve as a specific site for interactions with other components of the translational apparatus. They also suggest that the stability of the native eIF4E-eIF4G complex is determined by amino acid residues outside of the conserved seven-residue consensus sequence.

19609323|t|Structural basis for recruitment of BRCA2 by PALB2.
19609323|t|The breast cancer 2, early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination. BRCA2 recruits the recombinase RAD51 to sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments and thereby promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), mutations in which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype N of Fanconi anaemia. We have determined the structure of the PALB2 carboxy-terminal beta-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide. The structure shows the molecular determinants of this important protein-protein interaction and explains the effects of both cancer-associated truncating mutants in PALB2 and missense mutations in the amino-terminal region of BRCA2.

17306257|t|The adapter 3BP2 is involved in leukocyte signaling downstream Src/Syk-kinases coupled immunoreceptors.

A binding region of CIN85 SH3 domains on 3BP2 was mapped to a PVPTPR motif in the first proline-rich region of 3BP2, whereas the C-terminal SH3 domain of HIP-55 bound a more distal proline-rich domain of 3BP2.

16525503|t|An arginine/lysine-rich motif is crucial for VCP/p97-mediated modulation of ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis.
16525503|t|Arginine/lysine-rich motifs typically function as targeting signals for the translocation of proteins to the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that such a motif consisting of four basic amino acids in the polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 (Atx-3) serves as a recognition site for the interaction with the molecular chaperone VCP. Through this interaction, VCP modulates the fibrillogenesis of pathogenic forms of Atx-3 in a concentration-dependent manner, with low concentrations of VCP stimulating fibrillogenesis and excess concentrations suppressing it. No such effect was observed with a mutant Atx-3 variant, which does not contain a functional VCP interaction motif. Strikingly, a stretch of four basic amino acids in the ubiquitin chain assembly factor E4B was also discovered to be critical for VCP binding, indicating that arginine/lysine-rich motifs might be generally utilized by VCP for the targeting of proteins. In vivo studies with Drosophila models confirmed that VCP selectively modulates aggregation and neurotoxicity induced by pathogenic Atx-3. Together, these results define the VCP-Atx-3 association as a potential target for therapeutic intervention and suggest that it might influence the progression of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

24785777|t|Homooligomerization is needed for stability: a molecular modelling and solution study of Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
24785777|t|Although many enzymes are homooligomers composed of tightly bound subunits, it is often the case that smaller assemblies of such subunits, or even individual monomers, seem to have all the structural features necessary to independently conduct catalysis. In this study, we investigated the reasons justifying the necessity for the hexameric form of Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase - a homohexamer composed of three linked dimers - since it appears that the dimer is the smallest unit capable of catalyzing the reaction, according to the currently accepted mechanism. Molecular modelling was employed to probe mutations at the dimer-dimer interface that would result in a dimeric enzyme form. In this way, both in silico and in vitro, the hexamer was successfully transformed into dimers. However, modelling and solution studies show that, when isolated, dimers cannot maintain the appropriate three-dimensional structure, including the geometry of the active site and the position of the catalytically important amino acids. Analytical ultracentrifugation proves that E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase dimeric mutants tend to dissociate into monomers with dissociation constants of 20-80  m. Consistently, the catalytic activity of these mutants is negligible, at least 6 orders of magnitude smaller than for the wild-type enzyme. We conclude that the hexameric architecture of E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase is necessary to provide stabilization of the proper three-dimensional structure of the dimeric assembly, and therefore this enzyme is the obligate (obligatory) hexamer.

9882311|t|Interaction of the transcription factor TFIID with simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen interferes with replication of SV40 DNA in vitro.
9882311|t|Simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen is the major regulatory protein that directs the course of viral infection, primarily by interacting with host cell proteins and modulating their functions. Initiation of viral DNA replication requires specific interactions of T antigen bound to the viral origin of DNA replication with cellular replication proteins. Transcription factors are thought to stimulate initiation of viral DNA replication, but the mechanism of stimulation is poorly understood. Since the transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) binds to sequences within the origin of replication and interacts specifically with T antigen, we examined whether TBP complexes stimulate SV40 DNA replication in vitro. On the contrary, we found that depletion of TBP complexes from human cell extracts increased their ability to support viral DNA replication, and readdition of TBP complexes to the depleted extracts diminished their activity. We have mapped the sites of interaction between the proteins to residues 181 to 205 of T antigen and 184 to 220 of TBP. Titration of fusion proteins containing either of these peptides into undepleted cell extracts stimulated their replication activity, suggesting that they prevented the T antigen-TBP interaction that interfered with replication activity. TBP complexes also interfered with origin DNA unwinding by purified T antigen, and addition of either the T antigen or the TBP fusion peptide relieved the inhibition. These results suggest that TBP complexes associate with a T-antigen surface that is also required for origin DNA unwinding and viral DNA replication. We speculate that competition among cellular proteins for T antigen may play a role in regulating the course of viral infection.

15070733|t|M-phase kinases induce phospho-dependent ubiquitination of somatic Wee1 by SCFbeta-TrCP.
15070733|t|Wee1, the Cdc2 inhibitory kinase, needs to be down-regulated at the onset of mitosis to ensure rapid activation of Cdc2. Previously, we have shown that human somatic Wee1 (Wee1A) is down-regulated both by protein phosphorylation and degradation, but the underlying mechanisms had not been elucidated. In the present study, we have identified the beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 1/2 (beta-TrCP1/2) F-box protein-containing SKP1/Cul1/F-box protein (SCF) complex (SCF(beta-TrCP1/2)) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Wee1A ubiquitination. Although Wee1A lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for beta-TrCP, recognition of Wee1A by beta-TrCP depended on phosphorylation, and two serine residues in Wee1A, S53 and S123, were found to be the most important phosphorylation sites for beta-TrCP recognition. We have found also that the major M-phase kinases polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Cdc2 are responsible for the phosphorylation of S53 and S123, respectively, and that in each case phosphorylation generates an unconventional phospho-degron (signal for degradation) that can be recognized by beta-TrCP. Phosphorylation of Wee1A by these kinases cooperatively stimulated the recognition and ubiquitination of Wee1A by SCF(beta-TrCP1/2) in vitro. Mutation of these residues or depletion of beta-TrCP by small-interfering RNA treatment increased the stability of Wee1A in HeLa cells. Moreover, our analysis indicates that beta-TrCP-dependent degradation of Wee1A is important for the normal onset of M-phase in vivo. These results also establish the existence of a feedback loop between Cdc2 and Wee1A in somatic cells that depends on ubiquitination and protein degradation and ensures the rapid activation of Cdc2 when cells are ready to divide.

16474402|t|Molecular recognition of p53 and MDM2 by USP7/HAUSP.
16474402|t|The ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7, has key roles in the p53 pathway whereby it stabilizes both p53 and MDM2. We show that the N-terminal domain of USP7 binds two closely spaced 4-residue sites in both p53 and MDM2, falling between p53 residues 359-367 and MDM2 residues 147-159. Cocrystal structures with USP7 were determined for both p53 peptides and for one MDM2 peptide. These peptides bind the same surface of USP7 as Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, explaining the competitive nature of the interactions. The structures and mutagenesis data indicate a preference for a P/AXXS motif in peptides that bind USP7. Contacts made by serine are identical and crucial for all peptides, and Trp165 in the peptide-binding pocket of USP7 is also crucial. These results help to elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition by USP7 and the regulation of the p53 pathway.

20642453|t|14-3-3 binding to LRRK2 is disrupted by multiple Parkinson's disease-associated mutations and regulates cytoplasmic localization.
20642453|t|LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) is mutated in a significant number of Parkinson's disease patients, but still little is understood about how it is regulated or functions. In the present study we have demonstrated that 14-3-3 protein isoforms interact with LRRK2. Consistent with this, endogenous LRRK2 isolated from Swiss 3T3 cells or various mouse tissues is associated with endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms. We have established that 14-3-3 binding is mediated by phosphorylation of LRRK2 at two conserved residues (Ser910 and Ser935) located before the leucine-rich repeat domain. Our results suggests that mutation of Ser910 and/or Ser935 to disrupt 14-3-3 binding does not affect intrinsic protein kinase activity, but induces LRRK2 to accumulate within discrete cytoplasmic pools, perhaps resembling inclusion bodies. To investigate links between 14-3-3 binding and Parkinson's disease, we studied how 41 reported mutations of LRRK2 affected 14-3-3 binding and cellular localization. Strikingly, we found that five of the six most common pathogenic mutations (R1441C, R1441G, R1441H, Y1699C and I2020T) display markedly reduced phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 thereby disrupting interaction with 14-3-3. We have also demonstrated that Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to endogenous LRRK2 is significantly reduced in tissues of homozygous LRRK2(R1441C) knock-in mice. Consistent with 14-3-3 regulating localization, all of the common pathogenic mutations displaying reduced 14-3-3-binding accumulated within inclusion bodies. We also found that three of the 41 LRRK2 mutations analysed displayed elevated protein kinase activity (R1728H, ~2-fold; G2019S, ~3-fold; and T2031S, ~4-fold). These results provide the first evidence suggesting that 14-3-3 regulates LRRK2 and that disruption of the interaction of LRRK2 with 14-3-3 may be linked to Parkinson's disease.

18550827|t|Genetic analysis of CAND1-CUL1 interactions in Arabidopsis supports a role for CAND1-mediated cycling of the SCFTIR1 complex.
18550827|t|SKP1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin-ligases regulate numerous aspects of eukaryotic growth and development. Cullin-Associated and Neddylation-Dissociated (CAND1) modulates SCF function through its interactions with the CUL1 subunit. Although biochemical studies with human CAND1 suggested that CAND1 plays a negative regulatory role by sequestering CUL1 and preventing SCF complex assembly, genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that cand1 mutants exhibit reduced SCF activity, demonstrating that CAND1 is required for optimal SCF function in vivo. Together, these genetic and biochemical studies have suggested a model of CAND1-mediated cycles of SCF complex assembly and disassembly. Here, using the SCF(TIR1) complex of the Arabidopsis auxin response pathway, we test the SCF cycling model with Arabidopsis mutant derivatives of CAND1 and CUL1 that have opposing effects on the CAND1-CUL1 interaction. We find that the disruption of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction results in an increased abundance of assembled SCF(TIR1) complex. In contrast, stabilization of the CAND1-CUL1 interaction diminishes SCF(TIR1) complex abundance. The fact that both decreased and increased CAND1-CUL1 interactions result in reduced SCF(TIR1) activity in vivo strongly supports the hypothesis that CAND1-mediated cycling is required for optimal SCF function.

17296936|t|Interaction between chromatin proteins MECP2 and ATRX is disrupted by mutations that cause inherited mental retardation.
17296936|t|Mutations in the human methyl-CpG-binding protein gene MECP2 cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome and some cases of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). We report that MeCP2 interacts with ATRX, a SWI2/SNF2 DNA helicase/ATPase that is mutated in ATRX syndrome (alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked). MeCP2 can recruit the helicase domain of ATRX to heterochromatic foci in living mouse cells in a DNA methylation-dependent manner. Also, ATRX localization is disrupted in neurons of Mecp2-null mice. Point mutations within the methylated DNA-binding domain of MeCP2 that cause Rett syndrome or X-linked mental retardation inhibit its interaction with ATRX in vitro and its localization in vivo without affecting methyl-CpG binding. We propose that disruption of the MeCP2-ATRX interaction leads to pathological changes that contribute to mental retardation.

11880648|t|Mycobacterium tuberculosis WhiB3 interacts with RpoV to affect host survival but is dispensable for in vivo growth.
11880648|t|Previous work established that the principal sigma factor (RpoV) of virulent Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, restores virulence to an attenuated strain containing a point mutation (Arg-515-->His) in the 4.2 domain of RpoV. We used the 4.2 domain of RpoV as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an M. tuberculosis H37Rv library and identified a putative transcription factor, WhiB3, which selectively interacts with the 4.2 domain of RpoV in virulent strains but not with the mutated (Arg-515-->His) allele. Infection of mice and guinea pigs with a M. tuberculosis H37Rv whiB3 deletion mutant strain showed that whiB3 is not necessary for in vivo bacterial replication in either animal model. In contrast, an M. bovis whiB3 deletion mutant was completely attenuated for growth in guinea pigs. However, we found that immunocompetent mice infected with the M. tuberculosis H37Rv whiB3 mutant strain had significantly longer mean survival times as compared with mice challenged with wild-type M. tuberculosis. Remarkably, the bacterial organ burdens of both mutant and wild-type infected mice were identical during the acute and persistent phases of infection. Our results imply that M. tuberculosis replication per se is not a sufficient condition for virulence in vivo. They also indicate a different role for M. bovis and M. tuberculosis whiB3 genes in pathogenesis generated in different animal models. We propose that M. tuberculosis WhiB3 functions as a transcription factor regulating genes that influence the immune response of the host.

11278422|t|Yes-associated protein and p53-binding protein-2 interact through their WW and SH3 domains.
11278422|t|To understand the role of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), binding partners of its WW1 domain were isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of the interacting proteins was identified as p53-binding protein-2 (p53BP-2). YAP and p53BP-2 interacted in vitro and in vivo using their WW1 and SH3 domains, respectively. The YAP WW1 domain bound to the YPPPPY motif of p53BP-2, whereas the p53BP-2 SH3 domain interacted with the VPMRLR sequence of YAP, which is different from other known SH3 domain-binding motifs. By mutagenesis, we showed that this unusual SH3 domain interaction was due to the presence of three consecutive tryptophans located within the betaC strand of the SH3 domain. A point mutation within this triplet, W976R, restored the binding selectivity to the general consensus sequence for SH3 domains, the PXXP motif. A constitutively active form of c-Yes was observed to decrease the binding affinity between YAP and p53BP-2 using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas the overexpression of c-Yes did not modify this interaction. Since overexpression of an activated form of c-Yes resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p53BP-2, we propose that the p53BP-2 phosphorylation, possibly in the WW1 domain-binding motif, might negatively regulate the YAP.p53BP-2 complex.

19322201|t|Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of HuR by heat shock.
19322201|t|The RNA-binding protein HuR regulates the stability and translation of numerous mRNAs encoding stress-response and proliferative proteins. Although its post-transcriptional influence has been linked primarily to its cytoplasmic translocation, here we report that moderate heat shock (HS) potently reduces HuR levels, thereby altering the expression of HuR target mRNAs. HS did not change HuR mRNA levels or de novo translation, but instead reduced HuR protein stability. Supporting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this process were results showing that (1) HuR was ubiquitinated in vitro and in intact cells, (2) proteasome inhibition increased HuR abundance after HS, and (3) the HuR kinase checkpoint kinase 2 protected against the loss of HuR by HS. Within a central, HS-labile approximately 110-amino-acid region, K182 was found to be essential for HuR ubiquitination and proteolysis as mutant HuR(K182R) was left virtually unubiquitinated and was refractory to HS-triggered degradation. Our findings reveal that HS transiently lowers HuR by proteolysis linked to K182 ubiquitination and that HuR reduction enhances cell survival following HS.

20921992|t|Prevention of cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis by Mcl-1 requires interaction between Mcl-1 and Bim.
20921992|t|Growth factor withdrawal from hemopoietic cells results in activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Members of the Bcl-2 family regulate this pathway, with anti-apoptotic members counteracting the effects of pro-apoptotic members. We investigated the effect on Mcl-1 function of mutation at a conserved threonine 163 residue (T163) in its proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine rich (PEST) region. Under normal growth conditions, Mcl-1 half-life increased with alteration of T163 to glutamic acid, but decreased with mutation to alanine. However, both T163 mutants exhibited greater pro-survival effects compared with the wild type, which can be explained by an increased stability of the T163A mutant in cytokine-starved conditions. Both the mutant forms exhibited prolonged binding to pro-apoptotic Bim in cytokine-deprived cells. The extent to which Mcl-1 mutants were able to exert their anti-apoptotic effects correlated with their ability to associate with Bim. We further observed that primary bone marrow derived macrophages survived following cytokine withdrawal as long as Bim and Mcl-1 remained associated. In our study, we were unable to detect a role for GSK-3-mediated regulation of Mcl-1 expression. Based on these results we propose that upon cytokine withdrawal, survival of hemopoietic cells depends on association between Mcl-1 and Bim. Furthermore, alteration of T163 of Mcl-1 may change the protein such that its association with Bim is affected, resulting in prolonged association and increased survival.

8922390|t|Identification of LIM3 as the principal determinant of paxillin focal adhesion localization and characterization of a novel motif on paxillin directing vinculin and focal adhesion kinase binding.
8922390|t|Paxillin is a 68-kD focal adhesion phosphoprotein that interacts with several proteins including members of the src family of tyrosine kinases, the transforming protein v-crk, and the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and the tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This suggests a function for paxillin as a molecular adaptor, responsible for the recruitment of structural and signaling molecules to focal adhesions. The current study defines the vinculin- and FAK-interaction domains on paxillin and identifies the principal paxillin focal adhesion targeting motif. Using truncation and deletion mutagenesis, we have localized the vinculin-binding site on paxillin to a contiguous stretch of 21 amino acids spanning residues 143-164. In contrast, maximal binding of FAK to paxillin requires, in addition to the region of paxillin spanning amino acids 143-164, a carboxyl-terminal domain encompassing residues 265-313. These data demonstrate the presence of a single binding site for vinculin, and at least two binding sites for FAK that are separated by an intervening stretch of 100 amino acids. Vinculin- and FAK-binding activities within amino acids 143-164 were separable since mutation of amino acid 151 from a negatively charged glutamic acid to the uncharged polar residue glutamine (E151Q) reduced binding of vinculin to paxillin by >90%, with no reduction in the binding capacity for FAK. The requirement for focal adhesion targeting of the vinculin- and FAK-binding regions within paxillin was determined by transfection into CHO.K1 fibroblasts. Significantly and surprisingly, paxillin constructs containing both deletion and point mutations that abrogate binding of FAK and/or vinculin were found to target effectively to focal adhesions. Additionally, expression of the amino-terminal 313 amino acids of paxillin containing intact vinculin- and FAK-binding domains failed to target to focal adhesions. This indicated other regions of paxillin were functioning as focal adhesion localization motifs. The carboxyl-terminal half of paxillin (amino acids 313-559) contains four contiguous double zinc finger LIM domains. Transfection analyses of sequential carboxyl-terminal truncations of the four individual LIM motifs and site-directed mutagenesis of LIM domains 1, 2, and 3, as well as deletion mutagenesis, revealed that the principal mechanism of targeting paxillin to focal adhesions is through LIM3. These data demonstrate that paxillin localizes to focal adhesions independent of interactions with vinculin and/or FAK, and represents the first definitive demonstration of LIM domains functioning as a primary determinant of protein subcellular localization to focal adhesions.

16249186|t|Structure of the human Papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein and its mechanism for inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor.
16249186|t|The E7 oncoprotein from human Papillomavirus (HPV) mediates cell transformation in part by binding to the human pRb tumor suppressor protein and E2F transcription factors, resulting in the dissociation of pRb from E2F transcription factors and the premature cell progression into the S-phase of the cell cycle. This activity is mediated by the LXCXE motif and the CR3 zinc binding domain of the E7 protein. In this study we report the x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of HPV E7 and a structure-based mutational analysis to investigate its mode of pRb and E2F binding and E2F displacement from pRb. The structure reveals a novel zinc-bound E7-CR3 obligate homodimer that contains two surface patches of sequence conservation. Mutation of residues within these patches reveals that one patch is required for pRb binding, whereas the other is required for E2F binding. We also show that both E7-mediated interactions are required to disrupt pRb.E2F complexes. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb. Because the CR3 region of HPV E7 has no detectable homology to other human proteins, the structure-function studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small molecule compounds that inhibit HPV-E7-mediated cell transformation.

11283256|t|Intermolecular and intramolecular interactions regulate catalytic activity of myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase alpha.
11283256|t|Myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) is a Cdc42-binding serine/threonine kinase with multiple functional domains. We had previously shown MRCKalpha to be implicated in Cdc42-mediated peripheral actin formation and neurite outgrowth in HeLa and PC12 cells, respectively. Here we demonstrate that native MRCK exists in high-molecular-weight complexes. We further show that the three independent coiled-coil (CC) domains and the N-terminal region preceding the kinase domain are responsible for intermolecular interactions leading to MRCKalpha multimerization. N terminus-mediated dimerization and consequent transautophosphorylation are critical processes regulating MRCKalpha catalytic activities. A region containing the two distal CC domains (CC2 and CC3; residues 658 to 930) was found to interact intramolecularly with the kinase domain and negatively regulates its activity. Its deletion also resulted in an active kinase, confirming a negative autoregulatory role. We provide evidence that the N terminus-mediated dimerization and activation of MRCK and the negative autoregulatory kinase-distal CC interaction are two mutually exclusive events that tightly regulate the catalytic state of the kinase. Disruption of this interaction by a mutant kinase domain resulted in increased kinase activity. MRCK kinase activity was also elevated when cells were treated with phorbol ester, which can interact directly with a cysteine-rich domain next to the distal CC domain. We therefore suggest that binding of phorbol ester to MRCK releases its autoinhibition, allowing N-terminal dimerization and subsequent kinase activation.

19172740|t|Structure of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 fusion protein MJ1130: a model for the eukaryotic EKC/KEOPS subcomplex.
19172740|t|The EKC/KEOPS yeast complex is involved in telomere maintenance and transcription. The Bud32p and kinase-associated endopeptidase 1 (Kaelp) components of the complex are totally conserved in eukarya and archaea. Their genes are fused in several archaeal genomes, suggesting that they physically interact. We report here the structure of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Kae1/Bud32 fusion protein MJ1130. Kae1 is an iron protein with an ASKHA fold and Bud32 is an atypical small RIO-type kinase. The structure MJ1130 suggests that association with Kae1 maintains the Bud32 kinase in an inactive state. We indeed show that yeast Kae1p represses the kinase activity of yeast Bud32p. Extensive conserved interactions between MjKae1 and MjBud32 suggest that Kae1p and Bud32p directly interact in both yeast and archaea. Mutations that disrupt the Kae1p/Bud32p interaction in the context of the yeast complex have dramatic effects in vivo and in vitro, similar to those observed with deletion mutations of the respective components. Direct interaction between Kae1p and Bud32p in yeast is required both for the transcription and the telomere homeostasis function of EKC/KEOPS.

15292222|t|Identification and characterization of zipper-interacting protein kinase as the unique vascular smooth muscle myosin phosphatase-associated kinase.
15292222|t|Excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle involves activation of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, which increases activity of the myosin actin-activated ATPase, resulting in contraction. Phosphorylation of MLC phosphatase (SMPP-1M) by Rho-associated kinase or endogenous SMPP-1M-associated kinase inhibits SMPP-1M, enhancing MLC phosphorylation and contraction. However, the precise identity of SMPP-1M-associated kinase remains unclear. Biochemical evidence strongly supports the idea that SMPP-1M-associated kinase is related to the human serine/threonine leucine zipper-interacting protein kinase (hZIPK), which is important in cell apoptosis, and the SMPP-1M-associated kinase has therefore been called ZIP-like kinase (MacDonald, J. A., Borman, M. A., Murani, A., Somlyo, A. V., Hartshorne, D. J., and Haystead, T. A. J. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 2419-2424). Whether the vascular smooth muscle SMPP-1M-associated kinase is a truncated version of hZIPK, native hZIPK, or a unique homologue of hZIPK is unclear. Here we show that only native hZIPK mRNA and protein are detectable in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). High stringency screening of a human aortic cDNA library for the SMPP-1M-associated kinase identified 18 positive clones, all of which proved to be clones of hZIPK. PCR-based studies of VSMC RNA revealed native hZIPK transcripts but no evidence for splice variants of hZIPK or a ZIP-like kinase. Northern blotting studies of multiple vascular and non-vascular tissue RNAs, including human bladder RNA, showed only 2.3 kb of mRNA predicted for full-length hZIPK. Immunoblotting showed native full-length 52-kDa hZIPK expression in VSMCs. Full-length and N-terminal hZIPK bound the C-terminal domain (amino acids 681-847) of the myosin binding subunit (MBS) of SMPP-1M. hZIPK immunoprecipitated with the MBS of SMPP-1M and dominant negative RhoA inhibited the hZIPK-MBS interaction. These data identify hZIPK as the unique SMPP-1-associated kinase expressed in human vesicular smooth muscle and support a role for Rho in promoting the hZIPK-MBS interaction.

14532330|t|Laforin, the dual-phosphatase responsible for Lafora disease, interacts with R5 (PTG), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase-1 that enhances glycogen accumulation.
14532330|t|Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Lafora type (LD, MIM 254780) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the presence of progressive neurological deterioration, myoclonus, epilepsy and polyglucosan intracellular inclusion bodies, called Lafora bodies. Lafora bodies resemble glycogen with reduced branching, suggesting an alteration in glycogen metabolism. Linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping localized EPM2A, a major gene for LD, to chromosome 6q24. EPM2A encodes a protein of 331 amino acids (named laforin) with two domains, a dual-specificity phosphatase domain and a carbohydrate binding domain. Here we show that, in addition, laforin interacts with itself and with the glycogen targeting regulatory subunit R5 of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). R5 is the human homolog of the murine Protein Targeting to Glycogen, a protein that also acts as a molecular scaffold assembling PP1 with its substrate, glycogen synthase, at the intracellular glycogen particles. The laforin-R5 interaction was confirmed by pull-down and co-localization experiments. Full-length laforin is required for the interaction. However, a minimal central region of R5 (amino acids 116-238), including the binding sites for glycogen and for glycogen synthase, is sufficient to interact with laforin. Point-mutagenesis of the glycogen synthase-binding site completely blocked the interaction with laforin. The majority of the EPM2A missense mutations found in LD patients result in lack of phosphatase activity, absence of binding to glycogen and lack of interaction with R5. Interestingly, we have found that the LD-associated EPM2A missense mutation G240S has no effect on the phosphatase or glycogen binding activities of laforin but disrupts the interaction with R5, suggesting that binding to R5 is critical for the laforin function. These results place laforin in the context of a multiprotein complex associated with intracellular glycogen particles, reinforcing the concept that laforin is involved in the regulation of glycogen metabolism.

14527422|t|BTB/POZ domain proteins are putative substrate adaptors for cullin 3 ubiquitin ligases.
14527422|t|Cullins (CULs) are subunits of a prominent class of RING ubiquitin ligases. Whereas the subunits and substrates of CUL1-associated SCF complexes and CUL2 ubiquitin ligases are well established, they are largely unknown for other cullin family members. We show here that S. pombe CUL3 (Pcu3p) forms a complex with the RING protein Pip1p and all three BTB/POZ domain proteins encoded in the fission yeast genome. The integrity of the BTB/POZ domain, which shows similarity to the cullin binding proteins SKP1 and elongin C, is required for this interaction. Whereas Btb1p and Btb2p are stable proteins, Btb3p is ubiquitylated and degraded in a Pcu3p-dependent manner. Btb3p degradation requires its binding to a conserved N-terminal region of Pcu3p that precisely maps to the equivalent SKP1/F box adaptor binding domain of CUL1. We propose that the BTB/POZ domain defines a recognition motif for the assembly of substrate-specific RING/cullin 3/BTB ubiquitin ligase complexes.

20363945|t|Functional dissection of the conjugative coupling protein TrwB.
20363945|t|The conjugative coupling protein TrwB is responsible for connecting the relaxosome to the type IV secretion system during conjugative DNA transfer of plasmid R388. It is directly involved in transport of the relaxase TrwC, and it displays an ATPase activity probably involved in DNA pumping. We designed a conjugation assay in which the frequency of DNA transfer is directly proportional to the amount of TrwB. A collection of point mutants was constructed in the TrwB cytoplasmic domain on the basis of the crystal structure of TrwB Delta N70, targeting the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)-binding region, the cytoplasmic surface, or the internal channel in the hexamer. An additional set of transfer-deficient mutants was obtained by random mutagenesis. Most mutants were impaired in both DNA and protein transport. We found that the integrity of the nucleotide binding domain is absolutely required for TrwB function, which is also involved in monomer-monomer interactions. Polar residues surrounding the entrance and inside the internal channel were important for TrwB function and may be involved in interactions with the relaxosomal components. Finally, the N-terminal transmembrane domain of TrwB was subjected to random mutagenesis followed by a two-hybrid screen for mutants showing enhanced protein-protein interactions with the related TrwE protein of Bartonella tribocorum. Several point mutants were obtained with mutations in the transmembranal helices: specifically, one proline from each protein may be the key residue involved in the interaction of the coupling protein with the type IV secretion apparatus.

19262565|t|Negative regulation of NF-kappaB action by Set9-mediated lysine methylation of the RelA subunit.
19262565|t|Proper regulation of NF-kappaB activity is critical to maintain and balance the inflammatory response. Inactivation of the NF-kappaB complex relies in part on the proteasome-mediated degradation of promoter-bound NF-kappaB, but the detailed molecular mechanism initiating this process remains elusive. Here, we show that the methylation of the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB has an important function in this process. Lysine methyltransferase Set9 physically associates with RelA in vitro and in vivo in response to TNF-alpha stimulation. Mutational and mass spectrometric analyses reveal that RelA is monomethylated by Set9 at lysine residues 314 and 315 in vitro and in vivo. Methylation of RelA inhibits NF-kappaB action by inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of promoter-associated RelA. Depletion of Set9 by siRNA or mutation of the RelA methylation sites prolongs DNA binding of NF-kappaB and enhances TNF-alpha-induced expression of NF-kappaB target genes. Together, these findings unveil a novel mechanism by which methylation of RelA dictates the turnover of NF-kappaB and controls the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory response.

22487239|t|Functional analysis of the Notch ligand Jagged1 missense mutant proteins underlying Alagille syndrome.
22487239|t|Heterozygous mutations in the JAG1 gene, encoding Notch ligand Jagged1, cause Alagille syndrome (ALGS). As most of the mutations are nonsense or frameshift mutations producing inactive truncated proteins, haplo-insufficiency is considered the major pathogenic mechanism of ALGS. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the missense mutations cause ALGS remain unclear. Here we analyzed the functional properties of four ALGS missense mutant proteins, P163L, R184H, G386R and C714Y, using transfected mammalian cells. P163L and R184H showed Notch-binding activities similar to that of the wild-type when assessed by immunoprecipitation. However, their trans-activation and cis-inhibition activities were almost completely impaired. These mutant proteins localized mainly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that the mutations induced improper protein folding. Furthermore, the mutant proteins bound more strongly to the ER chaperone proteins calnexin and calreticulin than the wild-type did. C714Y also localized to the ER, but possessed significant trans-activation activity and lacked enhanced binding to the chaperones, indicating a less severe phenotype. The properties of G386R were the same as those of the wild-type. Dominant-negative effects were not detected for any mutant protein. These results indicate that accumulation in the ER and binding to the chaperones correlate with the impaired signal-transduction activities of the missense mutant proteins, which may contribute to the pathogenic mechanism of ALGS. Our findings, which suggest the requirement for cell-surface localization of Jagged1 for cis-inhibition activities, also provide important information for understanding the molecular basis of Notch-signaling pathways.

20705607|t|Turning the RING domain protein MdmX into an active ubiquitin-protein ligase.
20705607|t|The related RING domain proteins MdmX and Mdm2 are best known for their role as negative regulators of the tumor suppressor p53. However, although Mdm2 functions as a ubiquitin ligase for p53, MdmX does not have appreciable ubiquitin ligase activity. In this study, we performed a mutational analysis of the RING domain of MdmX, and we identified two distinct regions that, when replaced by the respective regions of Mdm2, turn MdmX into an active ubiquitin ligase for p53. Mdm2 and MdmX form homodimers as well as heterodimers with each other. One of the regions identified localizes to the dimer interface indicating that subtle conformational changes in this region either affect dimer stability and/or the interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5b. The second region contains the cryptic nucleolar localization signal of Mdm2 but is also assumed to be involved in the interaction with UbcH5b. Here, we show that this region has a significant impact on the ability of respective MdmX mutants to functionally interact with UbcH5b in vitro supporting the notion that this region serves two distinct functional purposes, nucleolar localization and ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, evidence is provided to suggest that the RING domain of Mdm2 not only binds to UbcH5b but also acts as an allosteric activator of UbcH5b.

10677492|t|Studies on the role of the hydrophobic domain of Ost4p in interactions with other subunits of yeast oligosaccharyl transferase.
10677492|t|In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oligosaccharyl transferase (OT), which catalyzes the transfer of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide chains to nascent polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, consists of nine nonidentical membrane protein subunits. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated these nine proteins exist in three subcomplexes. Three of the OT subunits (Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p) have been proposed to exist in one subcomplex. To investigate the interaction of these three membrane proteins, initially we carried out a mutational analysis of Ost4p, which is an extraordinarily small membrane protein containing only 36 amino acid residues. This analysis indicated that when single amino acid residues in a region close to the luminal face of the putative transmembrane domain of Ost4p were changed into an ionizable amino acid such as Lys or Asp, growth at 37 degrees C and OT activity measured in vitro were impaired. In addition, using immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blot analysis, we found that with these mutations the interaction between Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p was disrupted. Introduction of Lys or Asp residues at other positions in the putative transmembrane domain or at the N or C terminus of Ost4p had no effect on disrupting subunit interactions or impairing the activity of OT. These findings suggest that a localized region of the putative transmembrane domain of Ost4p mediates in stabilization of the interaction with the two other OT subunits (Ost3p and Stt3p) in a subcomplex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

10602480|t|Interaction partners of Dlk/ZIP kinase: co-expression of Dlk/ZIP kinase and Par-4 results in cytoplasmic retention and apoptosis.
10602480|t|Dlk/ZIP kinase is a newly discovered serine/threonine kinase which, due to its homology to DAP kinase, was named DAP like kinase, Dlk. This kinase is tightly associated with nuclear structures, it undergoes extensive autophosphorylation and phosphorylates myosin light chain and core histones H3, H2A and H4 in vitro. Moreover, it possesses a leucine zipper which mediates interaction with transcription factor ATF-4, therefore it was called ZIP kinase. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify interaction partners of Dlk that might serve as regulators or targets. Besides ATF-4 and others we found Par-4, a modulator of transcription factor WT1 and mediator of apoptosis. Complex formation between Dlk and Par-4 was confirmed by GST pull-down experiments and kinase reactions in vitro and coexpression experiments in vivo. The interaction domain within Dlk was mapped to an arginine-rich region between residues 338 - 417, rather than to the leucine zipper. Strikingly, coexpression of Dlk and Par-4 lead to relocation of Dlk from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, particularly to actin filaments. These interactions provoked a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton and morphological symptoms of apoptosis, thus suggesting a functional relationship between Dlk and Par-4 in the control of apoptosis.

By both co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments, specific interaction between Rcr1 and the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 was found. This binding was largely mediated by a singular VPEY sequence in Rcr1 in addition to PPSY, the consensus ligand motif of the WW domains.

10704439|t|MAD3 encodes a novel component of the spindle checkpoint which interacts with Bub3p, Cdc20p, and Mad2p.
10704439|t|We show that MAD3 encodes a novel 58-kD nuclear protein which is not essential for viability, but is an integral component of the spindle checkpoint in budding yeast. Sequence analysis reveals two regions of Mad3p that are 46 and 47% identical to sequences in the NH(2)-terminal region of the budding yeast Bub1 protein kinase. Bub1p is known to bind Bub3p (Roberts et al. 1994) and we use two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments to show that Mad3p can also bind to Bub3p. In addition, we find that Mad3p interacts with Mad2p and the cell cycle regulator Cdc20p. We show that the two regions of homology between Mad3p and Bub1p are crucial for these interactions and identify loss of function mutations within each domain of Mad3p. We discuss roles for Mad3p and its interactions with other spindle checkpoint proteins and with Cdc20p, the target of the checkpoint.

19497856|t|Biochemical and functional characterization of six SIX1 Branchio-oto-renal syndrome mutations.
19497856|t|Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss, branchial arch defects, and renal anomalies. Recently, eight mutations in the SIX1 homeobox gene were discovered in BOR patients. To characterize the effect of SIX1 BOR mutations on the EYA-SIX1-DNA complex, we expressed and purified six of the eight mutants in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that only the most N-terminal mutation in SIX1 (V17E) completely abolishes SIX1-EYA complex formation, whereas all of the other mutants are able to form a stable complex with EYA. We further show that only the V17E mutant fails to localize EYA to the nucleus and cannot be stabilized by EYA in the cell. The remaining five SIX1 mutants are instead all deficient in DNA binding. In contrast, V17E alone has a DNA binding affinity similar to that of wild type SIX1 in complex with the EYA co-factor. Finally, we show that all SIX1 BOR mutants are defective in transcriptional activation using luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that the SIX1 BOR mutations contribute to the pathology of the disease through at least two different mechanisms that involve: 1) abolishing the formation of the SIX1-EYA complex or 2) diminishing the ability of SIX1 to bind DNA. Furthermore, our data demonstrate for the first time that EYA: 1) requires the N-terminal region of the SIX1 Six domain for its interaction, 2) increases the level of the SIX1 protein within the cell, and 3) increases the DNA binding affinity of SIX1.

10415025|t|Direct suppression of TCR-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by leukocyte protein tyrosine phosphatase, a tyrosine-specific phosphatase.
10415025|t|Leukocyte protein tyrosine phosphatase (LC-PTP)/hemopoietic PTP is a human cytoplasmic PTP that is predominantly expressed in the hemopoietic cells. Recently, it was reported that hemopoietic PTP inhibited TCR-mediated signal transduction. However, the precise mechanism of the inhibition was not identified. Here we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is the direct target of LC-PTP. LC-PTP dephosphorylated ERK2 in vitro. Expression of wild-type LC-PTP in 293T cells suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK2 by a mutant MEK1, which was constitutively active regardless of upstream activation signals. No suppression of the phosphorylation was observed by LC-PTPCS, a catalytically inactive mutant. In Jurkat cells, LC-PTP suppressed the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. LC-PTP and LC-PTPCS made complexes with ERK1, ERK2, and p38alpha, but not with the gain-of-function sevenmaker ERK2 mutant (D321N). A small deletion (aa 1-46) in the N-terminal portion of LC-PTP or Arg to Ala substitutions at aa 41 and 42 resulted in the loss of ERK binding activity. These LC-PTP mutants revealed little inhibition of the ERK cascade activated by TCR cross-linking. On the other hand, the wild-type LC-PTP did not suppress the phosphorylation of sevenmaker ERK2 mutant. Thus, the complex formation of LC-PTP with ERK is the essential mechanism for the suppression. Taken collectively, these results indicate that LC-PTP suppresses mitogen-activated protein kinase directly in vivo.

22345554|t|Direct methylation of FXR by Set7/9, a lysine methyltransferase, regulates the expression of FXR target genes.
22345554|t|The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand (bile acid)-dependent nuclear receptor that regulates target genes involved in every aspect of bile acid homeostasis. Upon binding of ligand, FXR recruits an array of coactivators and associated proteins, some of which have intrinsic enzymatic activity that modify histones or even components of the transcriptional complex. In this study, we show chromatin occupancy by the Set7/9 methyltransferase at the FXR response element (FXRE) and direct methylation of FXR in vivo and in vitro at lysine 206. siRNA depletion of Set7/9 in the Huh-7 liver cell line decreased endogenous mRNAs of the FXR target genes, the short heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP). Mutation of the methylation site at K206 of FXR to an arginine prevented methylation by Set7/9. A pan-methyllysine antibody recognized the wild-type FXR but not the K206R mutant form. An electromobility shift assay showed that methylation by Set7/9 enhanced binding of FXR/retinoic X receptor-a to the FXRE. Interaction between hinge domain of FXR (containing K206) and Set7/9 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, GST pull down, and mammalian two-hybrid experiments. Set7/9 overexpression in Huh-7 cells significantly enhanced transactivation of the SHP and BSEP promoters in a ligand-dependent fashion by wild-type FXR but not the K206R mutant FXR. A Set7/9 mutant deficient in methyltransferase activity was also not effective in increasing transactivation of the BSEP promoter. These studies demonstrate that posttranslational methylation of FXR by Set7/9 contributes to the transcriptional activation of FXR-target genes.

23511974|t|Human microcephaly protein CEP135 binds to hSAS-6 and CPAP, and is required for centriole assembly.
23511974|t|Centrioles are cylindrical structures that are usually composed of nine triplets of microtubules (MTs) organized around a cartwheel-shaped structure. Recent studies have proposed a structural model of the SAS-6-based cartwheel, yet we do not know the molecular detail of how the cartwheel participates in centriolar MT assembly. In this study, we demonstrate that the human microcephaly protein, CEP135, directly interacts with hSAS-6 via its carboxyl-terminus and with MTs via its amino-terminus. Unexpectedly, CEP135 also interacts with another microcephaly protein CPAP via its amino terminal domain. Depletion of CEP135 not only perturbed the centriolar localization of CPAP, but also blocked CPAP-induced centriole elongation. Furthermore, CEP135 depletion led to abnormal centriole structures with altered numbers of MT triplets and shorter centrioles. Overexpression of a CEP135 mutant lacking the proper interaction with hSAS-6 had a dominant-negative effect on centriole assembly. We propose that CEP135 may serve as a linker protein that directly connects the central hub protein, hSAS-6, to the outer MTs, and suggest that this interaction stabilizes the proper cartwheel structure for further CPAP-mediated centriole elongation.

18242179|t|14-3-3 Proteins directly regulate Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase alpha through phosphorylation-dependent multisite binding.
18242179|t|Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase alpha (CaMKKalpha) plays critical roles in the modulation of neuronal cell survival as well as many other cellular activities. Here we show that 14-3-3 proteins directly regulate CaMKKalpha when the enzyme is phosphorylated by protein kinase A on either Ser74 or Ser475. Mutational analysis revealed that these two serines are both functional: the CaMKKalpha mutant with a mutation at either of these residues, but not the double mutant, was inhibited significantly by 14-3-3. The mode of regulation described herein differs the recently described mode of 14-3-3 regulation of CaMKKalpha.

11741893|t|Cloning of MASK, a novel member of the mammalian germinal center kinase III subfamily, with apoptosis-inducing properties.
11741893|t|We have cloned a novel human GCK family kinase that has been designated as MASK (Mst3 and SOK1-related kinase). MASK is widely expressed and encodes a protein of 416 amino acid residues, with an N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal region. Like other GCK-III subfamily kinases, MASK does not activate any mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Wild type MASK, but not a form lacking the C terminus, exhibits homophilic binding in the yeast two-hybrid system and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Additionally, deletion of this C-terminal region of MASK leads to an increased kinase activity toward itself as well as toward an exogenous substrate, myelin basic protein. A potential caspase 3 cleavage site (DESDS) is present in the C-terminal region of MASK, and we show that MASK is cleaved in vitro by caspase 3. Finally, wild type and C-terminally truncated forms of MASK can both induce apoptosis upon overexpression in mammalian cells that is abrogated by CrmA, suggesting involvement of MASK in the apoptotic machinery in mammalian cells.

12163175|t|PY motifs of Rod1 are required for binding to Rsp5 and for drug resistance.
12163175|t|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the overexpression of ROD1 confers resistance to o-dinitrobenzene (o-DNB), a representative of target drugs of glutathione S-transferase. The roles of Rod1 in drug resistance have remained to be determined. We isolated the rog3 mutation as a suppressor mutation of the temperature sensitivity of the strain, in that two of the total four glycogen synthase kinase 3 homologs were deleted. Rog3 is homologous to Rod1, and its overexpression also conferred resistance to o-DNB. Furthermore, these two proteins have PY-motifs, and bound to Rsp5, a hect-type ubiquitin ligase. The rsp5-101 mutant showed sensitivity to o-DNB as did the rod1 mutant, a mutant Rod1 containing altered PY motifs was defective in ability to bind to Rsp5 and in conferring o-DNB resistance. These results suggest that interaction of Rod1 and Rsp5 is important for drug resistance.

10805725|t|Class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases are downstream targets of activated polypeptide growth factor receptors.
10805725|t|The class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) PI3K-C2alpha and PI3K-C2beta are two recently identified members of the large PI3K family. Both enzymes are characterized by the presence of a C2 domain at the carboxy terminus and, in vitro, preferentially utilize phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate as lipid substrates. Little is understood about how the catalytic activity of either enzyme is regulated in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that PI3K-C2alpha and PI3K-C2beta represent two downstream targets of the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in human carcinoma-derived A431 cells. Stimulation of quiescent cultures with EGF resulted in the rapid recruitment of both enzymes to a phosphotyrosine signaling complex that contained the EGF receptor and Erb-B2. Ligand addition also induced the appearance of a second, more slowly migrating band of PI3K-C2alpha and PI3K-C2beta immunoreactivity on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since both PI3K enzymes can utilize Ca(2+) as an essential divalent cation in lipid kinase assays and since the catalytic activity of PI3K-C2alpha is refractory to the inhibitor wortmannin, these properties were used to confirm the recruitment of each PI3K isozyme to the activated EGF receptor complex. To examine this interaction in greater detail, PI3K-C2beta was chosen for further investigation. EGF and platelet-derived growth factor also stimulated the association of PI3K-C2beta with their respective receptors in other cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The use of EGF receptor mutants and phosphopeptides derived from the EGF receptor and Erb-B2 demonstrated that the interaction with recombinant PI3K-C2beta occurs through E(p)YL/I phosphotyrosine motifs. The N-terminal region of PI3K-C2beta was found to selectively interact with the EGF receptor in vitro, suggesting that it mediates the association of this PI3K with the receptor. However, the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear. We conclude that class II PI3K enzymes may contribute to the generation of 3' phosphoinositides following the activation of polypeptide growth factor receptors in vivo and thus mediate certain aspects of their biological activity.

23220480|t|Dominant-negative effects of LRRK2 heterodimers: a possible mechanism of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease caused by LRRK2 I2020T mutation.
23220480|t|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the molecule responsible for autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), PARK8, but the etiologic effects of its mutation remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism for the neurodegeneration induced by I2020T mutant LRRK2. Using native gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation, we found that wild-type (WT) LRRK2 formed a heterodimer with I2020T LRRK2 in transfected cells, and that the heterodimer exhibited a markedly lower intracellular protein level than the WT/WT-homodimer. An increased amount of I2020T LRRK2 decreased the protein level of co-transfected WT LRRK2. A pulse-chase experiment revealed that the intracellular protein lifetime of WT LRRK2 was shortened by co-transfection with I2020T LRRK2. These results suggest that I2020T LRRK2 enhances the intracellular degradation of WT LRRK2 through WT/I2020T-heterodimer formation. Overexpression of WT LRRK2 in HEK293 cells increased the phosphorylation level of Akt1 (S473), a possible physiological substrate of LRRK2, and made cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. However, both Akt1 phosphorylation and apoptosis resistance were reduced in WT/I2020T-expressing cells in comparison with WT/WT-expressing cells. Reduction of Akt1 phosphorylation and apoptosis resistance were also evident when a neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y clone overexpressing WT LRRK2 was transfected with the I2020T LRRK2. Altogether, these results suggest that the I2020T mutation enhances the intracellular degradation of LRRK2 through WT/I2020T-heterodimer formation, leading to reduced Akt1 phosphorylation and diminished protectivity against apoptosis. Our findings suggest the possibility of a dominant-negative mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD caused by I2020T LRRK2 mutation.

18676636|t|Human p32 is a novel FOXC1-interacting protein that regulates FOXC1 transcriptional activity in ocular cells.
18676636|t|PURPOSE: Mutations in the human forkhead box C1 gene (FOXC1) cause Axenfeld-Rieger (AR) malformations, often leading to glaucoma. Understanding the function of FOXC1 necessitates characterizing the proteins that interact with FOXC1. This study was undertaken to isolate FOXC1-interacting proteins and determine their effects on FOXC1. METHODS: To identify FOXC1-interacting proteins, a human trabecular meshwork (HTM) yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library was screened. The interaction and colocalization between FOXC1 and its putative protein partner were confirmed by Ni(2+) pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to study the effect of the interacting protein on FOXC1 DNA-binding ability. Dual luciferase assays using FOXC1 reporter plasmids in HTM cells were performed to determine the effect of the interaction on FOXC1 transcription activity. RESULTS: The human p32 protein was isolated as a putative FOXC1-interacting protein from a Y2H screen. The interaction of FOXC1 with p32 was confirmed by Ni-pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation. Although p32 is predominantly cytoplasmic, the portion of p32 that is within the nucleus colocalizes with FOXC1. The FOXC1 forkhead domain (FHD) was identified as the p32 interaction domain. p32 significantly inhibited FOXC1-mediated transcription activation in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect FOXC1 DNA-binding ability. Of interest, a FOXC1 mutation F112S displayed an impaired interaction with p32. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, the human p32 protein as a novel regulator of FOXC1-mediated transcription activation. Failure of p32 to interact with FOXC1 containing the disease-causing F112S mutation indicates that impaired protein interaction may be a disease mechanism for AR malformations.

12668732|t|Identification of SAP97 as an intracellular binding partner of TACE.
12668732|t|Tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) is the metalloprotease-disintegrin responsible for the ectodomain shedding of several proteins, including tumor necrosis factor alpha. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the scaffolding protein synapse associated protein 97 (SAP97) as a binding partner of the cytoplasmic domain of TACE. By deletions and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that this interaction involved the PDZ3 domain of SAP97 and the extreme C-terminal amino-acid sequence of TACE. This interaction as well as the identification of the specific domains involved was confirmed in vitro by affinity purification and in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and alteration of localization analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that endogenous TACE and SAP97 colocalized in some intracellular areas of COS-7 cells and CACO-2 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of SAP97, unlike that of a mutant form of SAP97 deleted for its PDZ3 domain, altered the ability of TACE to release its substrates. Altogether, these results demonstrate an interaction between TACE and SAP97, which may have a functional implication for the regulation of TACE shedding activity.

16682949|t|Centrosomal proteins Nde1 and Su48 form a complex regulated by phosphorylation.
16682949|t|The centrosome modulates spindle formation and plays a critical role in guiding proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome aberrations, frequently seen in human tumors, may cause abnormal chromosome segregation and contribute to malignant transformation. To explore the components of the centrosomes, we previously identified a novel centrosomal protein called Su48. To further characterize the Su48-containing protein ensemble in the centrosome, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and isolated a number of Su48-interacting molecules, including the centrosomal protein Nde1. Here, we demonstrate that Su48 can associate with Nde1. Moreover, we found that Nde1 is subjected to phosphorylation in vivo. In particular, we identified six putative Cdc2 phosphorylation sites in Nde1 and found that alteration of these sites diminishes phosphorylation by Cdc2 in vitro and affects the stability of Su48-Nde1 interactions and the centrosomal localization of Nde1. Ablation of Nde1 by gene specific small interfering RNA causes mitotic delay and cell death, coupled with a modest decrease in the incidence of the cells that harbor excessive centrosomes. Collectively, our findings indicate that Nde1 can form a protein complex with Su48 in the centrosome and plays an important role for successful mitosis.

15582318|t|Tcap gene mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy.
15582318|t|OBJECTIVES: We sought to explore the relationship between a Tcap gene (TCAP) abnormality and cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cause severe heart failure and sudden death. Recent genetic investigations have revealed that mutations of genes encoding Z-disc components, including titin and muscle LIM protein (MLP), are the primary cause of both HCM and DCM. The Z-disc plays a role in establishing the mechanical coupling of sarcomeric contraction and stretching, with the titin/Tcap/MLP complex serving as a mechanical stretch sensor. Tcap interacts with the calsarcin, which tethers the calcineurin to the Z-disc. METHODS: The TCAP was analyzed in 346 patients with HCM (236 familial and 110 sporadic cases) and 136 patients with DCM (34 familial and 102 sporadic cases). Two different in vitro qualitative assays-yeast two-hybrid and glutathion S-transferase pull-down competition-were performed in order to investigate functional changes in Tcap's interaction with MLP, titin, and calsarcin-1 caused by the identified mutations and a reported DCM-associated mutation, R87Q. RESULTS: Two TCAP mutations, T137I and R153H, were found in patients with HCM, and another TCAP mutation, E132Q, was identified in a patient with DCM. It was demonstrated by the qualitative assays that the HCM-associated mutations augment the ability of Tcap to interact with titin and calsarcin-1, whereas the DCM-associated mutations impair the interaction of Tcap with MLP, titin, and calsarcin-1. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the difference in clinical phenotype (HCM or DCM) may be correlated with the property of altered binding among the Z-disc components.

10880439|t|Inhibition of human ether    go-go potassium channels by Ca(2+)/calmodulin.
10880439|t|Intracellular Ca(2+) inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels of the ether    go-go (EAG) family. To identify the underlying molecular mechanism, we expressed the human version hEAG1 in Xenopus oocytes. The channels lost Ca(2+) sensitivity when measured in cell-free membrane patches. However, Ca(2+) sensitivity could be restored by application of recombinant calmodulin (CaM). In the presence of CaM, half inhibition of hEAG1 channels was obtained in 100 nM Ca(2+). Overlay assays using labelled CaM and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion fragments of hEAG1 demonstrated direct binding of CaM to a C-terminal domain (hEAG1 amino acids 673-770). Point mutations within this section revealed a novel CaM-binding domain putatively forming an amphipathic helix with both sides being important for binding. The binding of CaM to hEAG1 is, in contrast to Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels, Ca(2+) dependent, with an apparent K(D) of 480 nM. Co-expression experiments of wild-type and mutant channels revealed that the binding of one CaM molecule per channel complex is sufficient for channel inhibition.

16717130|t|Paxillin phosphorylation at Ser273 localizes a GIT1-PIX-PAK complex and regulates adhesion and protrusion dynamics.
16717130|t|Continuous adhesion formation and disassembly (adhesion turnover) in the protrusions of migrating cells is regulated by unclear mechanisms. We show that p21-activated kinase (PAK)-induced phosphorylation of serine 273 in paxillin is a critical regulator of this turnover. Paxillin-S273 phosphorylation dramatically increases migration, protrusion, and adhesion turnover by increasing paxillin-GIT1 binding and promoting the localization of a GIT1-PIX-PAK signaling module near the leading edge. Mutants that interfere with the formation of this ternary module abrogate the effects of paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. PAK-dependent paxillin-S273 phosphorylation functions in a positive-feedback loop, as active PAK, active Rac, and myosin II activity are all downstream effectors of this turnover pathway. Finally, our studies led us to identify in highly motile cells a class of small adhesions that reside near the leading edge, turnover in 20-30 s, and resemble those seen with paxillin-S273 phosphorylation. These adhesions appear to be regulated by the GIT1-PIX-PAK module near the leading edge.

9341137|t|Isolation and characterization of a dual prenylated Rab and VAMP2 receptor.
9341137|t|Rab GTPases have been implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a rat clone that interacts with Rab3A as well as with Rab1. The gene encodes a 20.6-kDa protein with two extensive hydrophobic domains and is broadly expressed in all tissues. This protein binds to prenylated Rab GTPases but not to other small Ras-like GTPases such as the Rho/Rac family. This prenylated Rab acceptor (PRA1) also binds specifically to the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2 (or synaptobrevin II) but shows no affinity for VAMP1 or cellubrevin in both the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays. This specificity resides, in part, in the proline-rich domain of VAMP2 as a chimera containing this domain of VAMP2 fused to VAMP1 is able to bind to PRA1. The transmembrane domain of VAMP2 is also essential as its deletion abolished binding to PRA1. Replacement of the deleted VAMP2 transmembrane domain by a CAAX prenylation signal can not restore binding to PRA1. This interaction is therefore distinct from that required for VAMP2 binding to either syntaxin or both syntaxin and SNAP-25. Deletion analysis on PRA1 indicates that the critical Rab- and VAMP2-interacting residues reside in two regions: the amino-terminal residues 30-54 and the extreme carboxyl-terminal domain. This dual Rab and VAMP2 binding characteristic suggests that PRA1 may serve to link these two protein families in the control of vesicle docking and fusion.

23532844|t|The Joubert syndrome-associated missense mutation (V443D) in the Abelson-helper integration site 1 (AHI1) protein alters its localization and protein-protein interactions.
23532844|t|BACKGROUND: Missense mutations in AHI1 result in the neurodevelopmental ciliopathy called Joubert syndrome. RESULTS: Mutations in AHI1 decrease cilia formation, alter its localization and stability, and change its binding to HAP1 and NPHP1. CONCLUSION: Mutations in AHI1 affect ciliogenesis, AHI1 protein localization, and AHI1-protein interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: This study begins to describe how missense mutations in AHI1 can cause Joubert syndrome. Mutations in AHI1 cause Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a neurodevelopmental ciliopathy, characterized by midbrain-hindbrain malformations and motor/cognitive deficits. Here, we show that primary cilia (PC) formation is decreased in fibroblasts from individuals with JBTS and AHI1 mutations. Most missense mutations in AHI1, causing JBTS, occur in known protein domains, however, a common V443D mutation in AHI1 is found in a region with no known protein motifs. We show that cells transfected with AHI1-V443D, or a new JBTS-causing mutation, AHI1-R351L, have aberrant localization of AHI1 at the basal bodies of PC and at cell-cell junctions, likely through decreased binding of mutant AHI1 to NPHP1 (another JBTS-causing protein). The AHI1-V443D mutation causes decreased AHI1 stability because there is a 50% reduction in AHI1-V443D protein levels compared with wild type AHI1. Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (Hap1) is a regulatory protein that binds Ahi1, and Hap1 knock-out mice have been reported to have JBTS-like phenotypes, suggesting a role for Hap1 in ciliogenesis. Fibroblasts and neurons with Hap1 deficiency form PC with normal growth factor-induced ciliary signaling, indicating that the Hap1 JBTS phenotype is likely not through effects at PC. These results also suggest that the binding of Ahi1 and Hap1 may not be critical for ciliary function. However, we show that HAP1 has decreased binding to AHI1-V443D indicating that this altered binding could be responsible for the JBTS-like phenotype through an unknown pathway. Thus, these JBTS-associated missense mutations alter their subcellular distribution and protein interactions, compromising functions of AHI1 in cell polarity and cilium-mediated signaling, thereby contributing to JBTS.

21203436|t|Arabidopsis MKS1 is involved in basal immunity and requires an intact N-terminal domain for proper function.
21203436|t|BACKGROUND: Innate immune signaling pathways in animals and plants are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) functions downstream of innate immune receptors via a nuclear substrate MKS1 to regulate the activity of the WRKY33 transcription factor, which in turn controls the production of anti-microbial phytoalexins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigate the role of MKS1 in basal resistance and the importance of its N- and C-terminal domains for MKS1 function. We used the information that mks1 loss-of-function partially suppresses the mpk4 loss-of-function phenotype, and that transgenic expression of functional MKS1 in mpk4/mks1 double mutants reverted the mpk4 dwarf phenotype. Transformation of mks1/mpk4 with mutant versions of MKS1 constructs showed that a single amino acid substitution in a putative MAP kinase docking domain, MKS1-L32A, or a truncated MKS1 version unable to interact with WRKY33, were deficient in reverting the double mutant to the mpk4 phenotype. These results demonstrate functional requirement in MKS1 for the interaction with MPK4 and WRKY33. In addition, nuclear localization of MKS1 was shown to depend on an intact N-terminal domain. Furthermore, loss-of-function mks1 mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to strains of Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, indicating that MKS1 plays a role in basal defense responses. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that MKS1 function and subcellular location requires an intact N-terminus important for both MPK4 and WRKY33 interactions.

21828050|t|Ubiquitin ligase activity of Cul3-KLHL7 protein is attenuated by autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa causative mutation.
21828050|t|Substrate-specific protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is crucial for the proper function of the cell. Proteins are specifically recognized and ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and are then degraded by the proteasome. BTB proteins act as the substrate recognition subunit that recruits their cognate substrates to the Cullin 3-based multisubunit E3s. Recently, it was reported that missense mutations in KLHL7, a BTB-Kelch protein, are related to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). However, the involvement of KLHL7 in the UPS and the outcome of the adRP causative mutations were unknown. In this study, we show that KLHL7 forms a dimer, assembles with Cul3 through its BTB and BACK domains, and exerts E3 activity. Lys-48-linked but not Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain co-localized with KLHL7, which increased upon proteasome inhibition suggesting that KLHL7 mediates protein degradation via UPS. An adRP-causative missense mutation in the BACK domain of KLHL7 attenuated only the Cul3 interaction but not dimerization. Nevertheless, the incorporation of the mutant as a heterodimer in the Cul3-KLHL7 complex diminished the E3 ligase activity. Together, our results suggest that KLHL7 constitutes a Cul3-based E3 and that the disease-causing mutation inhibits ligase activity in a dominant negative manner, which may lead to the inappropriate accumulation of the substrates targeted for proteasomal degradation.

18335997|t|Neogenin interacts with hemojuvelin through its two membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domains.
18335997|t|Hemojuvelin is a recently identified iron-regulatory protein that plays an important role in affecting the expression of hepcidin, a key iron regulatory hormone. Although the underlying mechanism of this process is not clear, several hemojuvelin-binding proteins, including the cell surface receptor neogenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) cytokines, have been identified. The ectodomain of neogenin is composed of four immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains followed by six fibronectin type III-like (FNIII) domains. Here we report expression of soluble versions of hemojuvelin and neogenin for biochemical characterization of their interaction and the interaction of HJV with BMP-2. Hemojuvelin normally undergoes an autocatalytic cleavage, and as in vivo, recombinant hemojuvelin exists as a mixture of cleaved and uncleaved forms. Neogenin binds to cleaved and noncleaved hemojuvelin, as verified by its binding to an uncleaved mutant hemojuvelin. We localized the hemojuvelin binding site on neogenin to the membrane-proximal fifth and sixth FNIII domains and the juxtamembrane linker and showed that a fragment containing only this region binds 2-3 orders of magnitude more tightly than the entire neogenin ectodomain. Binding to the most membrane-proximal region of neogenin may play a role in regulating the levels of soluble and membrane-bound forms of hemojuvelin, which in turn would influence the amount of free BMP-2 available for binding to its receptors and triggering transcription of the hepcidin gene. Our finding that BMP-2 and neogenin bind simultaneously to hemojuvelin raises the possibility that neogenin is part of a multiprotein complex at the hepatocyte membrane involving BMP, its receptors, and hemojuvelin.

17357085|t|Transcription factor SIX5 is mutated in patients with branchio-oto-renal syndrome.
17357085|t|Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by the association of branchial arch defects, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. Mutations in EYA1 are known to cause BOR. More recently, mutations in SIX1, which interacts with EYA1, were identified as an additional cause of BOR. A second member of the SIX family of proteins, unc-39 (SIX5), has also been reported to directly interact with eya-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans. We hypothesized that this interaction would be conserved in humans and that interactors of EYA1 represent good candidate genes for BOR. We therefore screened a cohort of 95 patients with BOR for mutations in SIX5. Four different heterozygous missense mutations were identified in five individuals. Functional analyses of these mutations demonstrated that two mutations affect EYA1-SIX5 binding and the ability of SIX5 or the EYA1-SIX5 complex to activate gene transcription. We thereby identified heterozygous mutations in SIX5 as a novel cause of BOR.

16446454|t|F-box-like domain in the polerovirus protein P0 is required for silencing suppressor function.
16446454|t|Plants employ small RNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene silencing as a virus defense mechanism. In response, plant viruses encode proteins that can suppress RNA silencing, but the mode of action of most such proteins is poorly understood. Here, we show that the silencing suppressor protein P0 of two Arabidopsis-infecting poleroviruses interacts by means of a conserved minimal F-box motif with Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs of S-phase kinase-related protein 1 (SKP1), a component of the SCF family of ubiquitin E3 ligases. Point mutations in the F-box-like motif abolished the P0-SKP1 ortholog interaction, diminished virus pathogenicity, and inhibited the silencing suppressor activity of P0. Knockdown of expression of a SKP1 ortholog in Nicotiana benthamiana rendered the plants resistant to polerovirus infection. Together, the results support a model in which P0 acts as an F-box protein that targets an essential component of the host posttranscriptional gene silencing machinery.

20007317|t|Structural basis for the interaction between yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex components Sgf11 and Sus1.
20007317|t|Sus1 is a central component of the yeast gene gating machinery, the process by which actively transcribing genes such as GAL1 become associated with nuclear pore complexes. Sus1 is a component of both the SAGA transcriptional co-activator complex and the TREX-2 complex that binds to nuclear pore complexes. TREX-2 contains two Sus1 chains that have an articulated helical hairpin fold, enabling them to wrap around an extended alpha-helix in Sac3, following a helical hydrophobic stripe. In SAGA, Sus1 binds to Sgf11 and has been proposed to provide a link between SAGA and TREX-2. We present here the crystal structure of the complex between Sus1 and the N-terminal region of Sgf11 that forms an extended alpha-helix around which Sus1 wraps in a manner that shares some similarities with the Sus1-Sac3 interface in TREX-2. However, the Sus1-binding site on Sgf11 is somewhat shorter than on Sac3 and is based on a narrower hydrophobic stripe. Engineered mutants that disrupt the Sgf11-Sus1 interaction in vitro confirm the importance of the hydrophobic helical stripe in molecular recognition. Helix alpha1 of the Sus1-articulated hairpin does not bind directly to Sgf11 and adopts a wide range of conformations within and between crystal forms, consistent with the presence of a flexible hinge and also with results from previous extensive mutagenesis studies (Kl  ckner, C., Schneider, M., Lutz, S., Jani, D., Kressler, D., Stewart, M., Hurt, E., and K  hler, A. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 12049-12056). A single Sus1 molecule cannot bind Sgf11 and Sac3 simultaneously and this, combined with the structure of the Sus1-Sgf11 complex, indicates that Sus1 forms separate subcomplexes within SAGA and TREX-2.

16286470|t|Cooperation of ERK and SCFSkp2 for MKP-1 destruction provides a positive feedback regulation of proliferating signaling.
16286470|t|The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase MKP-1/CL100/DUSP1 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering MKP-1 proteolysis. Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis stimulated by MKK1-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Skp2 enhanced MKP-1 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Skp2 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous MKP-1 degradation rate in a Skp2-dependent manner. Thus, MKP-1 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and SCF(Skp2) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.

21135508|t|Myotubularin controls desmin intermediate filament architecture and mitochondrial dynamics in human and mouse skeletal muscle.
21135508|t|Muscle contraction relies on a highly organized intracellular network of membrane organelles and cytoskeleton proteins. Among the latter are the intermediate filaments (IFs), a large family of proteins mutated in more than 30 human diseases. For example, mutations in the DES gene, which encodes the IF desmin, lead to desmin-related myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Here, we demonstrate that myotubularin (MTM1), which is mutated in individuals with X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM; also known as myotubular myopathy), is a desmin-binding protein and provide evidence for direct regulation of desmin by MTM1 in vitro and in vivo. XLCNM-causing mutations in MTM1 disrupted the MTM1-desmin complex, resulting in abnormal IF assembly and architecture in muscle cells and both mouse and human skeletal muscles. Adeno-associated virus-mediated ectopic expression of WT MTM1 in Mtm1-KO muscle reestablished normal desmin expression and localization. In addition, decreased MTM1 expression and XLCNM-causing mutations induced abnormal mitochondrial positioning, shape, dynamics, and function. We therefore conclude that MTM1 is a major regulator of both the desmin cytoskeleton and mitochondria homeostasis, specifically in skeletal muscle. Defects in IF stabilization and mitochondrial dynamics appear as common physiopathological features of centronuclear myopathies and desmin-related myopathies.

17558407|t|Mutations in the gene encoding the basal body protein RPGRIP1L, a nephrocystin-4 interactor, cause Joubert syndrome.
17558407|t|Protein-protein interaction analyses have uncovered a ciliary and basal body protein network that, when disrupted, can result in nephronophthisis (NPHP), Leber congenital amaurosis, Senior-L  ken syndrome (SLSN) or Joubert syndrome (JBTS). However, details of the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain poorly understood. RPGRIP1-like protein (RPGRIP1L) is a homolog of RPGRIP1 (RPGR-interacting protein 1), a ciliary protein defective in Leber congenital amaurosis. We show that RPGRIP1L interacts with nephrocystin-4 and that mutations in the gene encoding nephrocystin-4 (NPHP4) that are known to cause SLSN disrupt this interaction. RPGRIP1L is ubiquitously expressed, and its protein product localizes to basal bodies. Therefore, we analyzed RPGRIP1L as a candidate gene for JBTS and identified loss-of-function mutations in three families with typical JBTS, including the characteristic mid-hindbrain malformation. This work identifies RPGRIP1L as a gene responsible for JBTS and establishes a central role for cilia and basal bodies in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

25143260|t|Collapse of the native structure caused by a single amino acid exchange in human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase(1.).
25143260|t|Human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is essential for the antioxidant defense system, stabilization of tumor suppressors (e.g. p53, p33, and p73), and activation of quinone-based chemotherapeutics. Overexpression of NQO1 in many solid tumors, coupled with its ability to convert quinone-based chemotherapeutics into potent cytotoxic compounds, have made it a very attractive target for anticancer drugs. A naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism (C609T) leading to an amino acid exchange (P187S) has been implicated in the development of various cancers and poor survival rates following anthracyclin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite its importance for cancer prediction and therapy, the exact molecular basis for the loss of function in NQO1  P187S is currently unknown. Therefore, we solved the crystal structure of NQO1  P187S. Surprisingly, this structure is almost identical to NQO1. Employing a combination of NMR spectroscopy and limited proteolysis experiments, we demonstrated that the single amino acid exchange destabilized interactions between the core and C-terminus, leading to depopulation of the native structure in solution. This collapse of the native structure diminished cofactor affinity and led to a less competent FAD-binding pocket, thus severely compromising the catalytic capacity of the variant protein. Hence, our findings provide a rationale for the loss of function in NQO1  P187S with a frequently occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism.

However, apart from the catalytic exchange activity of the SEC7 domain, the functional significance of other conserved domains is virtually unknown. Here, we show that a distinct N-terminal domain of GNOM mediates dimerization and in addition interacts heterotypically with two other conserved domains in vivo. In contrast with N-terminal dimerization, the heterotypic interaction is essential for GNOM function, as mutations abolishing this interaction inactivate the GNOM protein and compromise its membrane association. Our results suggest a general model of large ARF-GEF function in which regulated changes in protein conformation control membrane association of the exchange factor and, thus, activation of ARFs.

16996049|t|Interaction of PAR-6 with CDC-42 is required for maintenance but not establishment of PAR asymmetry in C. elegans.
16996049|t|Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic polarity requires the asymmetrically distributed proteins PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3. The rho family GTPase CDC-42 regulates the activities of these proteins in mammals, flies and worms. To clarify its mode of action in C. elegans we disrupted the interaction between PAR-6 and CDC-42 in vivo, and also determined the distribution of GFP-tagged CDC-42 in the early embryo. Mutant PAR-6 proteins unable to interact with CDC-42 accumulated asymmetrically, at a reduced level, but this asymmetry was not maintained during the first division. We also determined that constitutively active GFP::CDC-42 becomes enriched in the anterior during the first cell cycle in a domain that overlaps with PAR-6. The asymmetry is dependent on PAR-2, PAR-5 and PAR-6. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of constitutively active GFP::CDC-42 increased the size of the anterior domain. We conclude that the CDC-42 interaction with PAR-6 is not required for the initial establishment of asymmetry but is required for maximal cortical accumulation of PAR-6 and to maintain its asymmetry.

24788516|t|Structural analysis of the KANSL1/WDR5/KANSL2 complex reveals that WDR5 is required for efficient assembly and chromatin targeting of the NSL complex.
24788516|t|The subunits of the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex, which include the histone acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first), play important roles in various cellular functions, including transcription regulation and stem cell identity maintenance and reprogramming, and are frequently misregulated in disease. Here, we provide the first biochemical and structural insights into the molecular architecture of this large multiprotein assembly. We identified several direct interactions within the complex and show that KANSL1 acts as a scaffold protein interacting with four other subunits, including WDR5, which in turn binds KANSL2. Structural analysis of the KANSL1/WDR5/KANSL2 subcomplex reveals how WDR5 is recruited into the NSL complex via conserved linear motifs of KANSL1 and KANSL2. Using structure-based KANSL1 mutants in transgenic flies, we show that the KANSL1-WDR5 interaction is required for proper assembly, efficient recruitment of the NSL complex to target promoters, and fly viability. Our data clearly show that the interactions of WDR5 with the MOF-containing NSL complex and MLL/COMPASS histone methyltransferase complexes are mutually exclusive. We propose that rather than being a shared subunit, WDR5 plays an important role in assembling distinct histone-modifying complexes with different epigenetic regulatory roles.

17711851|t|Identification of a redox-sensitive cysteine in GCP60 that regulates its interaction with golgin-160.
17711851|t|Golgin-160 is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates. It localizes to the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi and has a large C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The noncoiled-coil N-terminal head domain contains Golgi targeting information, a cryptic nuclear localization signal, and three caspase cleavage sites. Caspase cleavage of the golgin-160 head domain generates different fragments that can translocate to the nucleus by exposing the nuclear localization signal. We have previously shown that GCP60, a Golgi resident protein, interacts weakly with the golgin-160 head domain but has a strong interaction with one of the caspase-generated golgin-160 fragments (residues 140-311). This preferential interaction increases the Golgi retention of the golgin-160 fragment in cells overexpressing GCP60. Here we studied the interaction of golgin-160-(140-311) with GCP60 and identified a single cysteine residue in GCP60 (Cys-463) that is critical for the interaction of the two proteins. Mutation of the cysteine blocked the interaction in vitro and disrupted the ability to retain the golgin-160 fragment at the Golgi in cells. We also found that Cys-463 is redox-sensitive; in its reduced form, interaction with golgin-160 was diminished or abolished, whereas oxidation of the Cys-463 by hydrogen peroxide restored the interaction. In addition, incubation with a nitric oxide donor promoted this interaction in vitro. These findings suggest that nuclear translocation of golgin-160-(140-311) is a highly coordinated event regulated not only by cleavage of the golgin-160 head but also by the oxidation state of GCP60.

21481793|t|A tight junction-associated Merlin-angiomotin complex mediates Merlin's regulation of mitogenic signaling and tumor suppressive functions.
21481793|t|The Merlin/NF2 tumor suppressor restrains cell growth and tumorigenesis by controlling contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation. We have identified a tight-junction-associated protein complex comprising Merlin, Angiomotin, Patj, and Pals1. We demonstrate that Angiomotin functions downstream of Merlin and upstream of Rich1, a small GTPase Activating Protein, as a positive regulator of Rac1. Merlin, through competitive binding to Angiomotin, releases Rich1 from the Angiomotin-inhibitory complex, allowing Rich1 to inactivate Rac1, ultimately leading to attenuation of Rac1 and Ras-MAPK pathways. Patient-derived Merlin mutants show diminished binding capacities to Angiomotin and are unable to dissociate Rich1 from Angiomotin or inhibit MAPK signaling. Depletion of Angiomotin in Nf2(-/-) Schwann cells attenuates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, impedes cellular proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.

17855368|t|Identification of a novel inhibitor of differentiation-1 (ID-1) binding partner, caveolin-1, and its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
17855368|t|Recently, ID-1 (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding) is suggested as an oncogene and is reported to promote cell proliferation, invasion, and survival in several types of human cancer cells through multiple signaling pathways. However, how Id-1 interacts with these pathways and the immediate downstream effectors of the Id-1 protein are not known. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid screening technique, we identified a novel Id-1-interacting protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a cell membrane protein, and a positive regulator of cell survival and metastasis in prostate cancer. Using an immunoprecipitation method, we found that the helix-loop-helix domain of the Id-1 protein was essential for the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1. In addition, we also demonstrated that the physical interaction between Id-1 and Cav-1 played a key role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased cell migration rate as well as resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, our results revealed that this effect was regulated by Id-1-induced Akt activation through promoting the binding activity between Cav-1 and protein phosphatase 2A. Our study demonstrates a novel Id-1 binding partner and suggests a molecular mechanism that mediates the function of Id-1 in promoting prostate cancer progression through activation of the Akt pathway leading to cancer cell invasion and resistance to anticancer drug-induced apoptosis.

20561531|t|Structural basis for Par-4 recognition by the SPRY domain- and SOCS box-containing proteins SPSB1, SPSB2, and SPSB4.
20561531|t|The mammalian SPRY domain- and SOCS box-containing proteins, SPSB1 to SPSB4, belong to the SOCS box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Substrate recognition sites for the SPRY domain are identified only for human Par-4 (ELNNNL) and for the Drosophila orthologue GUSTAVUS binding to the DEAD-box RNA helicase VASA (DINNNN). To further investigate this consensus motif, we determined the crystal structures of SPSB1, SPSB2, and SPSB4, as well as their binding modes and affinities for both Par-4 and VASA. Mutation of each of the three Asn residues in Par-4 abrogated binding to all three SPSB proteins, while changing EL to DI enhanced binding. By comparison to SPSB1 and SPSB4, the more divergent protein SPSB2 showed only weak binding to Par-4 and was hypersensitive to DI substitution. Par-4((59-77)) binding perturbed NMR resonances from a number of SPSB2 residues flanking the ELNNN binding site, including loop D, which binds the EL/DI sequence. Although interactions with the consensus peptide motif were conserved in all structures, flanking sites in SPSB2 were identified as sites of structural change. These structural changes limit high-affinity interactions for SPSB2 to aspartate-containing sequences, whereas SPSB1 and SPSB4 bind strongly to both Par-4 and VASA peptides.

9990021|t|The retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator, RPGR, interacts with the delta subunit of rod cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.
9990021|t|Recently, the retinitis pigmentosa 3 (RP3) gene has been cloned and named retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR). The amino-terminal half of RPGR is homologous to regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1), the nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTP-binding protein Ran. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified the delta subunit of rod cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDEdelta) as interacting with the RCC1-like domain (RLD) of RPGR (RPGR392). The interaction of RPGR with PDEdelta was confirmed by pull-down assays and plasmon surface resonance. The binding affinity was determined to be 90 nM. Six missense mutations at evolutionary conserved residues within the RLD, which were found in RP3 patients, were analyzed by using the two-hybrid system. All missense mutations showed reduced interaction with PDEdelta. A non-RP3-associated missense substitution outside the RLD, V36F, did not abolish the interaction with PDEdelta. PDEdelta is widely expressed and highly conserved across evolution and is proposed to regulate the membrane insertion or solubilization of prenylated proteins, including the catalytic subunits of the PDE holoenzyme involved in phototransduction and small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family. These results suggest that RPGR mutations give rise to retinal degeneration by dysregulation of intracellular processes that determine protein localization and protein transport.

18171471|t|Multiple paxillin binding sites regulate FAK function.
18171471|t|BACKGROUND: FAK localization to focal adhesions is essential for its activation and function. Localization of FAK is mediated through the C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain. Recent structural analyses have revealed two paxillin-binding sites in the FAT domain of FAK. To define the role of paxillin binding to each site on FAK, point mutations have been engineered to specifically disrupt paxillin binding to each docking site on the FAT domain of FAK individually or in combination. RESULTS: These mutants have been characterized and reveal an important role for paxillin binding in FAK subcellular localization and signaling. One paxillin-binding site (comprised of alpha-helices 1 and 4 of the FAT domain) plays a more prominent role in localization than the other. Mutation of either paxillin-binding site has similar effects on FAK activation and downstream signaling. However, the sites aren't strictly redundant as each mutant exhibits phosphorylation/signaling defects distinct from wild type FAK and a mutant completely defective for paxillin binding. CONCLUSION: The studies demonstrate that the two paxillin-binding sites of FAK are not redundant and that both sites are required for FAK function.

21531806|t|Binding and spreading of ParB on DNA determine its biological function in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
21531806|t|ParB protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to a widely represented ParB family of chromosomally and plasmid-encoded partitioning type IA proteins. Ten putative parS sites are dispersed in the P. aeruginosa chromosome, with eight of them localizing in the oriC domain. After binding to parS, ParB spreads on the DNA, causing transcriptional silencing of nearby genes (A. A. Bartosik et al., J. Bacteriol. 186:6983-6998, 2004). We have studied ParB derivatives impaired in spreading either due to loss of DNA-binding ability or oligomerization. We defined specific determinants outside of the helix-turn-helix motif responsible for DNA binding. Analysis confirmed the localization of the main dimerization domain in the C terminus of ParB but also mapped another self-interactive domain in the N-terminal domain. Reverse genetics were used to introduce five parB alleles impaired in spreading into the P. aeruginosa chromosome. The single amino acid substitutions in ParB causing a defect in oligomerization but not in DNA binding caused a chromosome segregation defect, slowed the growth rate, and impaired motilities, similarly to the pleiotropic phenotype of parB-null mutants, indicating that the ability to spread is vital for ParB function in the cell. The toxicity of ParB overproduction in Pseudomonas spp. is not due to the spreading since several ParB derivatives defective in oligomerization were still toxic for P. aeruginosa when provided in excess.

14685257|t|Structural basis of ligand recognition by PABC, a highly specific peptide-binding domain found in poly(A)-binding protein and a HECT ubiquitin ligase.
14685257|t|The C-terminal domain of poly(A)-binding protein (PABC) is a peptide-binding domain found in poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) and a HECT (homologous to E6-AP C-terminus) family E3 ubiquitin ligase. In protein synthesis, the PABC domain of PABP functions to recruit several translation factors possessing the PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2) to the mRNA poly(A) tail. We have determined the solution structure of the human PABC domain in complex with two peptides from PABP-interacting protein-1 (Paip1) and Paip2. The structures show a novel mode of peptide recognition, in which the peptide binds as a pair of beta-turns with extensive hydrophobic, electrostatic and aromatic stacking interactions. Mutagenesis of PABC and peptide residues was used to identify key protein-peptide interactions and quantified by isothermal calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance and GST pull-down assays. The results provide insight into the specificity of PABC in mediating PABP-protein interactions.

22634751|t|Mutations in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN1C cause IMAGe syndrome.
22634751|t|IMAGe syndrome (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) is an undergrowth developmental disorder with life-threatening consequences. An identity-by-descent analysis in a family with IMAGe syndrome identified a 17.2-Mb locus on chromosome 11p15 that segregated in the affected family members. Targeted exon array capture of the disease locus, followed by high-throughput genomic sequencing and validation by dideoxy sequencing, identified missense mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN1C (also known as P57KIP2) in two familial and four unrelated patients. A familial analysis showed an imprinted mode of inheritance in which only maternal transmission of the mutation resulted in IMAGe syndrome. CDKN1C inhibits cell-cycle progression, and we found that targeted expression of IMAGe-associated CDKN1C mutations in Drosophila caused severe eye growth defects compared to wild-type CDKN1C, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. All IMAGe-associated mutations clustered in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN1C and resulted in loss of PCNA binding, distinguishing them from the mutations of CDKN1C that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome.

11157984|t|Cdc42Hs facilitates cytoskeletal reorganization and neurite outgrowth by localizing the 58-kD insulin receptor substrate to filamentous actin.
11157984|t|Cdc42Hs is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and is required for neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which Cdc42Hs regulates these processes, a search for novel Cdc42Hs protein partners was undertaken by yeast two-hybrid assay. Here, we identify the 58-kD substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRS-58) as a Cdc42Hs target. IRS-58 is a brain-enriched protein comprising at least four protein-protein interaction sites: a Cdc42Hs binding site, an Src homology (SH)3-binding site, an SH3 domain, and a tryptophan, tyrptophan (WW)-binding domain. Expression of IRS-58 in Swiss 3T3 cells leads to reorganization of the filamentous (F)-actin cytoskeleton, involving loss of stress fibers and formation of filopodia and clusters. In N1E-115 cells IRS-58 induces neurite outgrowth with high complexity. Expression of a deletion mutant of IRS-58, which lacks the SH3- and WW-binding domains, induced neurite extension without complexity in N1E-115 cells. In Swiss 3T3 cells and N1E-115 cells, IRS-58 colocalizes with F-actin in clusters and filopodia. An IRS-58(1267N) mutant unable to bind Cdc42Hs failed to localize with F-actin to induce neurite outgrowth or significant cytoskeletal reorganization. These results suggest that Cdc42Hs facilitates cytoskeletal reorganization and neurite outgrowth by localizing protein complexes via adaptor proteins such as IRS-58 to F-actin.

10336672|t|Differential interaction of the tSXV motifs of the NR1 and NR2A NMDA receptor subunits with PSD-95 and SAP97.
10336672|t|The NR1 and NR2 subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are encoded by distinct genes. In the rat brain, four C-terminal variants of the NR1 subunit (NR1-1 to NR1-4) are encoded by a single gene, and are generated by alternative splicing of the C1 and C2 exon cassettes, while four different genes encode the NR2 subunits (NR2 A-D). Functional NMDA receptors result from the heteromultimeric assembly of NR1 variants with distinct NR2 subunits. The NR2B subunit interacts with post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), SAP97 and members of the membrane-associated guanylate-like kinase (MAGUK) family of proteins. This interaction occurs through the binding of the C-terminal tSXV intracellular motif of the NR2B subunit to the N-terminal PDZ (PSD-95, discs-large, ZO-1) domains of the PSD-95 and SAP97 proteins. Both NR1-3 and NR1-4 also display a consensus C-terminal tSXV motif. Using the two-hybrid genetic system in yeast and site-directed mutagenesis, we compared the binding of the NR2A, NR1-3 and NR1-4 tSXV motifs with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SAP97. The main conclusions of the present report are that: (i) while NR2A displays a strong interaction with PSD-95 and SAP97, the NR1-3 and NR1-4 NMDA receptor subunits do not display any interaction despite the presence of tSXV motifs; (ii) the C-terminal tSXV motif of the NR2A subunit is mandatory but not sufficient for efficient interaction with the PSD-95 and SAP97 proteins; (iii) as yet unidentified upstream sequences of the receptor subunits determine whether the tSXV motifs will bind to the PSD-95 and SAP97 PDZ domains; (iv) different tSXV motifs elicit interactions of variable strengths; and (v) residues in positions -3 and -4 modulate the binding affinity of the C-terminal tSXV motifs. Using immunohistochemistry, we also compared the distribution of the PSD-95, NR2A and SAP97 proteins in adult rat brain, and we show that in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, there is evidence for colocalization of these proteins.

17875641|t|Wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential to cell cycle progression in G(1)/S and G(2)/M transitions in fission yeast.
17875641|t|Inosine (I) at position 34 (wobble position) of tRNA is formed by the hydrolytic deamination of a genomically encoded adenosine (A). The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, termed tRNA A:34 deaminase, is the heterodimeric Tad2p/ADAT2.Tad3p/ADAT3 complex in eukaryotes. In budding yeast, deletion of each subunit is lethal, indicating that the wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential for viability; however, most of its physiological roles remain unknown. To identify novel cell cycle mutants in fission yeast, we isolated the tad3-1 mutant that is allelic to the tad3(+) gene encoding a homolog of budding yeast Tad3p. Interestingly, the tad3-1 mutant cells principally exhibited cell cycle-specific phenotype, namely temperature-sensitive and irreversible cell cycle arrest both in G(1) and G(2). Further analyses revealed that in the tad3-1 mutant cells, the S257N mutation that occurred in the catalytically inactive Tad3 subunit affected its association with catalytically active Tad2 subunit, leading to an impairment in the A to I conversion at position 34 of tRNA. In tad3-1 mutant cells, the overexpression of the tad3(+) gene completely suppressed the decreased tRNA inosine content. Notably, the overexpression of the tad2(+) gene partially suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype and the decreased tRNA inosine content, indicating that the tad3-1 mutant phenotype is because of the insufficient I(34) formation of tRNA. These results suggest that the wobble inosine tRNA modification is essential for cell cycle progression in the G(1)/S and G(2)/M transitions in fission yeast.

9388232|t|Dimerization properties of human BAD. Identification of a BH-3 domain and analysis of its binding to mutant BCL-2 and BCL-XL proteins.
9388232|t|Bad, an inducer of programmed cell death, was recently isolated from a mouse cDNA library by its ability to bind to the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. Sequence analysis suggested that Bad was a member of the BCL-2 gene family that encodes both inducers and inhibitors of programmed cell death. To further analyze the role of BAD in the network of homo- and heterodimers formed by the BCL-2 family, we have cloned the human homologue of BAD and assessed its biological activity and its interactions with wild type and mutant BCL-2 family proteins. Our results indicate that the human BAD protein, like its mouse homologue, is able to induce apoptosis when transfected into mammalian cells. Furthermore, in yeast two-hybrid assays as well as quantitative in vitro interaction assays, human Bad interacted with BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Sequence alignments of human BAD revealed the presence of a BH-3 homology domain as seen in other BCL-2 family proteins. Peptides derived from this domain were able to completely inhibit the dimerization of BAD with BCL-XL. Thus, as previously shown for BAX, BAK, BCL-2, and BCL-XL, the BH3 domain of BAD is required for its dimerization with other BCL-2 family proteins. BAD was further analyzed for its ability to bind to various mutants of BCL-2 and BCL-XL that have lost the ability to bind BAX and BAK, some of which retain biological activity and some of which do not. Surprisingly, all of the mutated BCL-2 and BCL-XL proteins analyzed strongly interacted with human BAD. Our data thus indicate that mutations in BCL-2 and BCL-XL can differentially affect the heterodimeric binding of different death-promoting proteins and have implications concerning the relationship between heterodimerization and biological activity.

14567693|t|Direct extracellular interaction between carbonic anhydrase IV and the human NBC1 sodium/bicarbonate co-transporter.
14567693|t|Sodium/bicarbonate co-transporters (NBC) are crucial in the regulation of intracellular pH (pH(i)) and HCO(3)(-) metabolism. Electrogenic NBC1 catalyzes HCO(3)(-) fluxes in mammalian kidney, pancreas, and heart cells. Carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV), which is also present in these tissues, is glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored to the outer surface of the plasma membrane where it catalyzes the hydration-dehydration of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-). The physical and functional interactions of CAIV and NBC1 were investigated. NBC1 activity was measured by changes of pH(i) in NBC1-transfected HEK293 cells subjected to acid loads. Cotransfection of CAIV with NBC1 increased the rate of pH(i) recovery by 44 +/- 3%, as compared to NBC1-alone. In contrast, CAIV did not increase the functional activity of G767T-NBC1 (mutated on the fourth extracellular loop (EC4) of NBC1), and G767T-NBC1, unlike wild-type NBC1, did not interact with CAIV in glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays. This indicates that G767 of NBC1 is directly involved in CAIV interaction. NBC1-mediated pH(i) recovery rate after acid load was inhibited by 40 +/- 7% when coexpressed with the inactive human CAII mutant, V143Y. V143Y CAII competes with endogenous CAII for interaction with NBC1 at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, which indicates that NBC1/CAII interaction is needed for full pH(i) recovery activity. We conclude that CAIV binds EC4 of NBC1, and this interaction is essential for full NBC1 activity. The tethering of CAII and CAIV close to the NBC1 HCO(3)(-) transport site maximizes the transmembrane HCO(3)(-) gradient local to NBC1 and thereby activates the transport rate.

20150898|t|Regulation of clathrin adaptor function in endocytosis: novel role for the SAM domain.
20150898|t|During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, adaptor proteins play central roles in coordinating the assembly of clathrin coats and cargo selection. Here we characterize the binding of the yeast endocytic adaptor Sla1p to clathrin through a variant clathrin-binding motif that is negatively regulated by the Sla1p SHD2 domain. The crystal structure of SHD2 identifies the domain as a sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain and shows a propensity to oligomerize. By co-immunoprecipitation, Sla1p binds to clathrin and self-associates in vivo. Mutations in the clathrin-binding motif that abolish clathrin binding and structure-based mutations in SHD2 that impede self-association result in endocytosis defects and altered dynamics of Sla1p assembly at the sites of endocytosis. These results define a novel mechanism for negative regulation of clathrin binding by an adaptor and suggest a role for SAM domains in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

21247419|t|Rasd1 interacts with Ear2 (Nr2f6) to regulate renin transcription.
21247419|t|BACKGROUND: The Rasd1 protein is a dexamethasone induced monomeric Ras-like G protein that oscillates in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Previous studies have shown that Rasd1 modulates multiple signaling cascades. However, it is still unclear exactly how Rasd1 carries out its function. Studying protein-protein interactions involving Rasd1 may provide insights into its biological functions in different contexts. RESULTS: To further explore the molecular function of Rasd1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified Ear2, a negative regulator of renin transcription, as an interaction partner of Rasd1. We validated the interaction in vitro and in transfected COS-7 cells. We further confirmed the interaction of endogenous Rasd1 and Ear2 from HEK293T cell and mouse brain extract. Rasd1 inhibited transcriptional repression by Ear2 on a renin promoter-luciferase reporter construct both in the presence and absence of all-trans-retinoic acid. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR showed upregulation of endogenous renin transcription in As4.1 cells over-expressing Rasd1. We demonstrated that the ligand binding domain of Ear2 is required for physical and functional interaction between the two proteins. In addition, we demonstrated that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rasd1 results in further repression of Ear2-mediated renin transcription, whereas induction of Rasd1 by dexamethasone counteracts the effects of shRNA-mediated Rasd1 knockdown. Finally, our study showed that Rasd1 missense mutations not only attenuate their physical interaction with Ear2 but also abolish their ability to counteract repression of renin transcription mediated by Ear2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for physical and functional interactions between Rasd1 and Ear2. The results suggest that their interactions are involved in renin transcriptional regulation. These findings not only reveal a novel role for Rasd1-medated signaling but also provide the basis for potential intervention of renin expression.

16510448|t|Functional roles of p12, the fourth subunit of human DNA polymerase delta.
16510448|t|Mammalian DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), a key enzyme of chromosomal DNA replication, consists of four subunits as follows: the catalytic subunit; p125, which is tightly associated with the p50 subunit; p68, a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding protein; and a fourth subunit, p12. In this study, the functional roles of the p12 subunit of pol delta were studied. The inter-subunit interactions of the p12 subunit were determined by yeast two-hybrid assays and by pulldown assays. These assays revealed that p12 interacts with p125 as well as p50. This dual interaction of p12 suggests that it may serve to stabilize the p125-p50 interaction. p12 was shown to be a novel PCNA-binding protein. This was confirmed by identification of a PCNA-binding motif at its N terminus by binding assays and by site-directed mutagenesis. The activities and reaction products of recombinant pol delta containing a p12 mutant defective in PCNA binding, as well as purified recombinant pol delta and its subassemblies, were analyzed. Our results indicate that p12 contributes to PCNA-dependent pol delta activity, i.e. the p12-PCNA interaction is functional. Our data indicate that both p12 and p68 are required for optimal pol delta activity. This supports the hypothesis that the interaction between pol delta and PCNA is a divalent one that involves p12 and p68. We propose a model in which pol delta interacts with PCNA via at least two of its subunits, and one in which p12 could play a role in stabilizing the overall pol delta-PCNA complex as well as pol delta itself.

10097141|t|Specific association of the gene product of PKD2 with the TRPC1 channel.
10097141|t|The function(s) of the genes (PKD1 and PKD2) responsible for the majority of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is unknown. While PKD1 encodes a large integral membrane protein containing several structural motifs found in known proteins involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, PKD2 has homology to PKD1 and the major subunit of the voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. We now describe sequence homology between PKD2 and various members of the mammalian transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) proteins, thought to be activated by G protein-coupled receptor activation and/or depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. We show that PKD2 can directly associate with TRPC1 but not TRPC3 in transfected cells and in vitro. This association is mediated by two distinct domains in PKD2. One domain involves a minimal region of 73 amino acids in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PKD2 shown previously to constitute an interacting domain with PKD1. However, distinct residues within this region mediate specific interactions with TRPC1 or PKD1. The C-terminal domain is sufficient but not necessary for the PKD2-TRPC1 association. A more N-terminal domain located within transmembrane segments S2 and S5, including a putative pore helical region between S5 and S6, is also responsible for the association. Given the ability of the TRPC to form functional homo- and heteromultimeric complexes, these data provide evidence that PKD2 may be functionally related to TRPC proteins and suggest a possible role of PKD2 in modulating Ca2+ entry in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation and/or store depletion.

9299557|t|A20 inhibits NF-kappaB activation independently of binding to 14-3-3 proteins.
9299557|t|The A20 protein, which belongs to a class of Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger proteins, has been characterized as an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation. In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for interacting proteins. We report that different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins, viz. eta and zeta, are able to bind A20, involving the 14-3-3-binding motif RSKSDP located between zinc fingers 3 and 4. However, A20 mutants that no longer associated with 14-3-3 proteins could still fully inhibit NF-kappaB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1beta or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thus excluding a crucial role for 14-3-3 interaction in this A20 function.

15951562|t|Binding of PTEN to specific PDZ domains contributes to PTEN protein stability and phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases.
15951562|t|The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including MAGI-1/2/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association with scaffolding and/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinases.

21376235|t|Mpk1 MAPK association with the Paf1 complex blocks Sen1-mediated premature transcription termination.
21376235|t|The Mpk1 MAPK of the yeast cell wall integrity pathway uses a noncatalytic mechanism to activate transcription of stress-induced genes by recruitment of initiation factors to target promoters. We show here that Mpk1 additionally serves a function in transcription elongation that is also independent of its catalytic activity. This function is mediated by an interaction between Mpk1 and the Paf1 subunit of the Paf1C elongation complex. A mutation in Paf1 that blocks this interaction causes a specific defect in transcription elongation of an Mpk1-induced gene, which results from Sen1-dependent premature termination through a Nab3-binding site within the promoter-proximal region of the gene. Our findings reveal a regulatory mechanism in which Mpk1 overcomes transcriptional attenuation by blocking recruitment of the Sen1-Nrd1-Nab3 termination complex to the elongating polymerase. Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanism is conserved in an interaction between the human ERK5 MAPK and human Paf1.

10430869|t|Crystal structure of the alpha appendage of AP-2 reveals a recruitment platform for clathrin-coat assembly.
10430869|t|AP-2 adaptors regulate clathrin-bud formation at the cell surface by recruiting clathrin trimers to the plasma membrane and by selecting certain membrane proteins for inclusion within the developing clathrin-coat structure. These functions are performed by discrete subunits of the adaptor heterotetramer. The carboxyl-terminal appendage of the AP-2 alpha subunit appears to regulate the translocation of several endocytic accessory proteins to the bud site. We have determined the crystal structure of the alpha appendage at 1.4-A resolution by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing. It is composed of two distinct structural modules, a beta-sandwich domain and a mixed alpha-beta platform domain. Structure-based mutagenesis shows that alterations to the molecular surface of a highly conserved region on the platform domain differentially affect associations of the appendage with amphiphysin, eps15, epsin, and AP180, revealing a common protein-binding interface.

14507921|t|Binding of anthrax toxin to its receptor is similar to alpha integrin-ligand interactions.
14507921|t|The secreted protein toxin produced by Bacillus anthracis contributes to virulence of this pathogen and can cause many of the symptoms seen during an anthrax infection, including shock and sudden death. The cell-binding component of anthrax toxin, protective antigen, mediates entry of the toxin into cells by first binding directly to the extracellular integrin-like inserted (I) domain of the cellular anthrax toxin receptor, ATR. Here we report that this interaction requires an intact metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the receptor as well as the presence of specific divalent cations. Also, we demonstrate that the toxin-receptor interaction is critically dependent on the Asp-683 carboxylate group of protective antigen, which projects from the receptor binding surface. We propose that this carboxylate group completes the coordination of the MIDAS metal of ATR, mimicking integrin-ligand interactions.

16775625|t|A Cdc2-related protein kinase hPFTAIRE1 from human brain interacting with 14-3-3 proteins.
16775625|t|hPFTAIRE1 (PFTK1), a Cdc2-related protein kinase, is highly expressed in human brain. It exhibits cytoplasmic distribution in Hela cells, although it contains two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its N-terminus. To search for its substrates and regulatory components, we screened a two-hybrid library by using the full-length hPFTAIRE1 as a bait. Four 14-3-3 isoforms (beta, epsilon, eta, tau) were identified interacting with the hPFTAIRE1. We found a putative 14-3-3 binding consensus motif (RHSSPSS) in the hPFTAIRE1, which overlapped with its second NLS. Deletion of the RHSSPSS motif or substitution of Ser119 with Ala in the conserved binding motif abolished the specific interaction between the hPFTAIRE1 and the 14-3-3 proteins. The mutant S120A hPFTAIRE1 also showed a weak interaction to the 14-3-3 proteins. The results suggested that the Ser119 is crucial for the interaction between hPFTAIRE1 and the 14-3-3 proteins. All the hPFTAIRE1 mutants distributed in cytoplasm of Hela cells and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) when fused to the C-terminus of a green fluorescent protein (GFP), indicating that binding with the 14-3-3 proteins does not contribute to the subcellular localization of the hPFTAIRE1, although the binding may be involved in its signaling regulation.

21816275|t|The Min oscillator uses MinD-dependent conformational changes in MinE to spatially regulate cytokinesis.
21816275|t|In E. coli, MinD recruits MinE to the membrane, leading to a coupled oscillation required for spatial regulation of the cytokinetic Z ring. How these proteins interact, however, is not clear because the MinD-binding regions of MinE are sequestered within a six-stranded b sheet and masked by N-terminal helices. minE mutations that restore interaction between some MinD and MinE mutants were isolated. These mutations alter the MinE structure leading to release of the MinD-binding regions and the N-terminal helices that bind the membrane. Crystallization of MinD-MinE complexes revealed a four-stranded b sheet MinE dimer with the released b strands (MinD-binding regions) converted to a helices bound to MinD dimers. These results identify the MinD-dependent conformational changes in MinE that convert it from a latent to an active form and lead to a model of how MinE persists at the MinD-membrane surface.

11323411|t|Phosphotyrosines 627 and 659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) conferring binding and activation of SHP2.
11323411|t|A major Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) binding partner in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells is protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) SHP2, which contains tandem SH2 domains. The SHP2 PTPase activity is required for activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase by EGF. To investigate the mechanism by which Gab1 and SHP2 mediate ERK activation, we characterized the Gab1-SHP2 interaction. We found that both Tyr-627 and Tyr-659 of Gab1 were required for SHP2 binding to Gab1 and for ERK2 activation by EGF. Far Western blot analysis suggested that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bind to Gab1 in a specific orientation, in which the N-SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-627 and the C-SH2 domain binds to Tyr(P)-659. When assayed with peptide substrates, SHP2 PTPase was activated by a bisphosphopeptide containing both Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659, but not by monophosphopeptides containing Tyr(P)-627 or Tyr(P)-659 or a mixture of these monophosphopeptides. These results suggest that Tyr(P)-627 and Tyr(P)-659 of Gab1 constitute a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) that binds and activates SHP2. Remarkably, while a constitutively active SHP2 (SHP2DeltaN) could not rescue the defect of a SHP2-binding defective Gab1 (Gab1FF) in ERK2 activation, expression of a Gab1FF-SHP2DeltaN chimera resulted in constitutive activation of ERK2 in transfected cells. Thus, physical association of activated SHP2 with Gab1 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Phosphopeptides derived from Gab1 were dephosphorylated by active SHP2 in vitro. Consistently, substrate-trapping experiments with a SHP2 catalytic inactive mutant suggested that Gab1 was a SHP2 PTPase substrate in the cells. Therefore, Gab1 not only is a SHP2 activator but also is a target of its PTPase.

16266891|t|Interactions between RPS19, mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the PIM-1 oncoprotein.
16266891|t|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation. Patients' bone marrow progenitor cells do not respond to erythropoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin. Mutations in the gene encoding for ribosomal protein (RP) S19 account for 25% of cases of DBA. The link between defective erythropoiesis and RPS19 is still unclear. Two not mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: altered protein synthesis and loss of unknown extraribosomal functions. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used yeast two-hybrid screening and a human liver cDNA library obtained at 19-24 weeks of gestation, when hepatic erythropoiesis is efficient, to search for proteins interacting with RPS19. RESULTS: We found that RPS19 binds PIM-1, an ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase whose expression can be induced in erythropoietic cells by several growth factors, such as erythropoietin. The PIM-1/RPS19 interaction was demonstrated both in vitro and in living cells and led to phosphorylation of RPS19 in an in vitro kinase assay. We also showed that in human 293T cells PIM-1 interacts with ribosomes and may be involved in translational control. Three DBA-associated RPS19 mutations alter the binding between RPS19 and PIM-1. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A link between erythropoietic growth factor signaling and RPS19 has been identified for the first time.

15447654|t|Formation of an SCF(ZTL) complex is required for proper regulation of circadian timing.
15447654|t|The circadian timing system involves an autoregulatory transcription/translation feedback loop that incorporates a diverse array of factors to maintain a 24-h periodicity. In Arabidopsis a novel F-box protein, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), plays an important role in the control of the free-running period of the circadian clock. As a class, F-box proteins are well-established components of the Skp/Cullin/F-box (SCF) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases that link the target substrates to the core ubiquitinating activity of the ligase complex via direct association with the Skp protein. Here we identify and characterize the SCFZTL complex in detail. Yeast two-hybrid tests demonstrate the sufficiency and necessity of the F-box domain for Arabidopsis Skp-like protein (ASK) interactions and the dispensability of the unique N-terminal LOV domain in this association. Co-immunoprecipitation of full-length (FL) ZTL with the three known core components of SCF complexes (ASK1, AtCUL1 and AtRBX1) demonstrates that ZTL can assemble into an SCF complex in vivo. F-box-containing truncated versions of ZTL (LOV-F and F-kelch) can complex with SCF components in vivo, whereas stably expressed LOV or kelch domains alone cannot. Stable expression of F-box-mutated FL ZTL eliminates the shortened period caused by mild ZTL overexpression and also abolishes ASK1 interaction in vivo. Reduced levels of the core SCF component AtRBX1 phenocopy the long period phenotype of ztl loss-of-function mutations, demonstrating the functional significance of the SCFZTL complex. Taken together, our data establish SCFZTL as an essential SCF class E3 ligase controlling circadian period in plants.

16782870|t|Interaction between PCNA and diubiquitinated Mcm10 is essential for cell growth in budding yeast.
16782870|t|The minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (Mcm10) is an evolutionarily conserved factor that is essential for replication initiation and elongation. Mcm10 is part of the eukaryotic replication fork and interacts with a variety of proteins, including the Mcm2-7 helicase and DNA polymerase alpha/primase complexes. A motif search revealed a match to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interacting protein (PIP) box in Mcm10. Here, we demonstrate a direct interaction between Mcm10 and PCNA that is alleviated by mutations in conserved residues of the PIP box. Interestingly, only the diubiquitinated form of Mcm10 binds to PCNA. Diubiquitination of Mcm10 is cell cycle regulated; it first appears in late G(1) and persists throughout S phase. During this time, diubiquitinated Mcm10 is associated with chromatin, suggesting a direct role in DNA replication. Surprisingly, a Y245A substitution in the PIP box of Mcm10 that inhibits the interaction with PCNA abolishes cell proliferation. This severe-growth phenotype, which has not been observed for analogous mutations in other PCNA-interacting proteins, is rescued by a compensatory mutation in PCNA that restores interaction with Mcm10-Y245A. Taken together, our results suggest that diubiquitinated Mcm10 interacts with PCNA to facilitate an essential step in DNA elongation.

10887186|t|The leucine zipper of NRL interacts with the CRX homeodomain. A possible mechanism of transcriptional synergy in rhodopsin regulation.
10887186|t|Photoreceptor-specific expression of rhodopsin is mediated by multiple cis-acting elements in the proximal promoter region. NRL (neural retina leucine zipper) and CRX (cone rod homeobox) proteins bind to the adjacent NRE and Ret-4 sites, respectively, within this region. Although NRL and CRX are each individually able to induce rhodopsin promoter activity, when expressed together they exhibit transcriptional synergy in rhodopsin promoter activation. Using the yeast two-hybrid method and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, we demonstrate that the leucine zipper of NRL can physically interact with CRX. Deletion analysis revealed that the CRX homeodomain (CRX-HD) plays an important role in the interaction with the NRL leucine zipper. Although binding with the CRX-HD alone was weak, a strong interaction was detected when flanking regions including the glutamine-rich and the basic regions that follow the HD were included. A reciprocal deletion analysis showed that the leucine zipper of NRL is required for interaction with CRX-HD. Two disease-causing mutations in CRX-HD (R41W and R90W) that exhibit reduced DNA binding and transcriptional synergy also decrease its interaction with NRL. These studies suggest novel possibilities for protein-protein interaction between two conserved DNA-binding motifs and imply that cross-talk among distinct regulatory pathways contributes to the establishment and maintenance of photoreceptor function.

10373560|t|Overproduction of human Myt1 kinase induces a G2 cell cycle delay by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes.
10373560|t|The Myt1 protein kinase functions to negatively regulate Cdc2-cyclin B complexes by phosphorylating Cdc2 on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15. Throughout interphase, human Myt1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, whereas Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we report that overproduction of either kinase-active or kinase-inactive forms of Myt1 blocked the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin B1 and caused cells to delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The COOH-terminal 63 amino acids of Myt1 were identified as a Cdc2-cyclin B1 interaction domain. Myt1 mutants lacking this domain no longer bound cyclin B1 and did not efficiently phosphorylate Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in vitro. In addition, cells overproducing mutant forms of Myt1 lacking the interaction domain exhibited normal trafficking of cyclin B1 and unperturbed cell cycle progression. These results suggest that the docking of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes to the COOH terminus of Myt1 facilitates the phosphorylation of Cdc2 by Myt1 and that overproduction of Myt1 perturbs cell cycle progression by sequestering Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm.

16003391|t|AtBAG6, a novel calmodulin-binding protein, induces programmed cell death in yeast and plants.
16003391|t|Calmodulin (CaM) influences many cellular processes by interacting with various proteins. Here, we isolated AtBAG6, an Arabidopsis CaM-binding protein that contains a central BCL-2-associated athanogene (BAG) domain. In yeast and plants, overexpression of AtBAG6 induced cell death phenotypes consistent with programmed cell death (PCD). Recombinant AtBAG6 had higher affinity for CaM in the absence of free Ca2 + than in its presence. An IQ motif (IQXXXRGXXXR, where X denotes any amino-acid) was required for Ca2 +-independent CaM complex formation and single amino-acid changes within this motif abrogated both AtBAG6-activated CaM-binding and cell death in yeast and plants. A 134-amino-acid stretch, encompassing both the IQ motif and BAG domain, was sufficient to induce cell death. Agents generating oxygen radicals, which are known to be involved in plant PCD, specifically induced the AtBAG6 transcript. Collectively, these results suggest that AtBAG6 is a stress-upregulated CaM-binding protein involved in plant PCD.

12626716|t|Functional dissection of the zinc finger and flanking domains of the Yth1 cleavage/polyadenylation factor.
12626716|t|Yth1, a subunit of yeast Cleavage Polyadenylation Factor (CPF), contains five CCCH zinc fingers. Yth1 was previously shown to interact with pre-mRNA and with two CPF subunits, Brr5/Ysh1 and the polyadenylation-specific Fip1, and to act in both steps of mRNA 3' end processing. In the present study, we have identified new domains involved in each interaction and have analyzed the consequences of mutating these regions on Yth1 function in vivo and in vitro. We have found that the essential fourth zinc finger (ZF4) of Yth1 is critical for interaction with Fip1 and RNA, but not for cleavage, and a single point mutation in ZF4 impairs only polyadenylation. Deletion of the essential N-terminal region that includes the ZF1 or deletion of ZF4 weakened the interaction with Brr5 in vitro. In vitro assays showed that the N-terminus is necessary for both processing steps. Of particular importance, we find that the binding of Fip1 to Yth1 blocks the RNA-Yth1 interaction, and that this inhibition requires the Yth1-interacting domain on Fip1. Our results suggest a role for Yth1 not only in the execution of cleavage and poly(A) addition, but also in the transition from one step to the other.

8944023|t|Identification of a RING protein that can interact in vivo with the BRCA1 gene product.
8944023|t|The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene, BRCA1, encodes a large polypeptide that contains the cysteine-rich RING motif, a zinc-binding domain found in a variety of regulatory proteins. Here we describe a novel protein that interacts in vivo with the N-terminal region of BRCA1. This BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein contains an N-terminal RING motif, three tandem ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal sequence with significant homology to the phylogenetically conserved BRCT domains that lie near the C terminus of BRCA1. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by BRCA1 missense mutations that segregate with breast cancer susceptibility, indicating that BARD1 may be involved in mediating tumour suppression by BRCA1.

20952388|t|Molecular association of the Arabidopsis ETR1 ethylene receptor and a regulator of ethylene signaling, RTE1.
20952388|t|The plant hormone ethylene plays important roles in growth and development. Ethylene is perceived by a family of membrane-bound receptors that actively repress ethylene responses. When the receptors bind ethylene, their signaling is shut off, activating responses. REVERSION-TO-ETHYLENE SENSITIVITY (RTE1) encodes a novel membrane protein conserved in plants and metazoans. Genetic analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that RTE1 promotes the signaling state of the ethylene receptor ETR1 through the ETR1 N-terminal domain. RTE1 and ETR1 have been shown to co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis. Here, we demonstrate a physical association of RTE1 and ETR1 using in vivo and in vitro methods. Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was revealed in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in a tobacco cell transient assay and in stably transformed Arabidopsis. The association was also observed using a truncated version of ETR1 comprising the N terminus (amino acids 1-349). Interaction of RTE1 and ETR1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from Arabidopsis. The interaction occurs with high affinity (K(d), 117 nM) based on tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy using purified recombinant RTE1 and a tryptophan-less version of purified recombinant ETR1. An amino acid substitution (C161Y) in RTE1 that is known to confer an ETR1 loss-of-function phenotype correspondingly gives a nearly 12-fold increase in the dissociation constant (K(d), 1.38  M). These findings indicate that a high affinity association of RTE1 and ETR1 is important in the regulation of ETR1.

12813456|t|Interaction of the HPV E7 proteins with the pCAF acetyltransferase.
12813456|t|Most cervical carcinomas express the E6 and E7 proteins of a high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). These proteins affect growth control by interfering with the functions of cell regulatory proteins, promoting oncogenic transformation. A key target of E7 is the tumor suppressor protein pRb, which directly interacts with E7. However, binding to additional cellular regulatory proteins is clearly required for oncogenesis, as mutants of E7 have been identified that bind to pRb, yet fail to transform efficiently. Here we demonstrate the interaction of the HPV 6, 16 and 18 E7 proteins with the pCAF acetyltransferase, which has been reported to function as a coactivator for a variety of transcription factors including p53. Mutation of a highly conserved leucine residue within the zinc finger region of HPV 16 E7 disrupts binding to pCAF and also impairs transformation and transcriptional activation. HPV 16 E7 interacts with the acetyltransferase domain of pCAF, and reduces its acetyltransferase activity in vitro. Our analysis of the interaction between the pCAF acetyltransferase and E7 provides new insight into the mechanisms by which the E7 oncoproteins can alter cellular gene expression and growth.

11230129|t|The NAF domain defines a novel protein-protein interaction module conserved in Ca2+-regulated kinases.
11230129|t|The Arabidopsis calcineurin B-like calcium sensor proteins (AtCBLs) interact with a group of serine-threonine protein kinases (AtCIPKs) in a calcium-dependent manner. Here we identify a 24 amino acid domain (NAF domain) unique to these kinases as being required and sufficient for interaction with all known AtCBLs. Mutation of conserved residues either abolished or significantly diminished the affinity of AtCIPK1 for AtCBL2. Comprehensive two-hybrid screens with various AtCBLs identified 15 CIPKs as potential targets of CBL proteins. Database analyses revealed additional kinases from Arabidopsis and other plant species harbouring the NAF interaction module. Several of these kinases have been implicated in various signalling pathways mediating responses to stress, hormones and environmental cues. Full-length CIPKs show preferential interaction with distinct CBLs in yeast and in vitro assays. Our findings suggest differential interaction affinity as one of the mechanisms generating the temporal and spatial specificity of calcium signals within plant cells and that different combinations of CBL-CIPK proteins contribute to the complex network that connects various extracellular signals to defined cellular responses.

16260786|t|Molecular basis of the interaction between the flagellar export proteins FliI and FliH from Helicobacter pylori.
16260786|t|Bacterial flagellar protein export requires an ATPase, FliI, and presumptive inhibitor, FliH. We have explored the molecular basis for FliI/FliH interaction in the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. By using bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, we showed that residues 1-18 of FliI very likely form an amphipathic alpha-helix upon interaction with FliH, and that residues 21-91 of FliI resemble the N-terminal oligomerization domain of the F1-ATPase catalytic subunits. A truncated FliI-(2-91) protein was shown to be folded, although the N-terminal 18 residues were likely unstructured. Deletion and scanning mutagenesis showed that residues 1-18 of FliI were essential for the FliI/FliH interaction. Scanning mutation of amino acids in the N-terminal 10 residues of FliI indicated that a cluster of hydrophobic residues in this segment was critical for the interaction with FliH. The interaction between FliI and FliH has similarities to the interaction between the N-terminal alpha-helix of the F1-ATPase alpha-subunit and the globular domain of the F1-ATPase delta-subunit, respectively. This similarity suggests that FliH may function as a molecular stator.

10913138|t|S100A6 and S100A11 are specific targets of the calcium- and zinc-binding S100B protein in vivo.
10913138|t|In solution, S100B protein is a noncovalent homodimer composed of two subunits associated in an antiparallel manner. Upon calcium binding, the conformation of S100B changes dramatically, leading to the exposure of hydrophobic residues at the surface of S100B. The residues in the C-terminal domain of S100B encompassing Phe(87) and Phe(88) have been implicated in interaction with target proteins. In this study, we used two-hybrid technology to identify specific S100B target proteins. Using S100B as bait, we identify S100A6 and S100A11 as specific targets for S100B. S100A1, the closest homologue of S100B, is capable of interaction with S100B but does not interact with S100A6 or S100A11. S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 isoforms are co-regulated and co-localized in astrocytoma U373 cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Ca(2+)/Zn(2+) stabilizes S100B-S100A6 and S100B-S100A11 heterocomplexes. Deletion of the C-terminal domain or mutation of Phe(87) and Phe(88) residues has no effect on S100B homodimerization and heterodimerization with S100A1 but drastically decreases interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11. Our data suggest that the interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 should not be viewed as a typical S100 heterodimerization but rather as a model of interaction between S100B and target proteins.

9264463|t|A specific domain in alpha-catenin mediates binding to beta-catenin or plakoglobin.
9264463|t|The E-cadherin-catenin adhesion complex has been the subject of many structural and functional studies because of its importance in development, normal tissue function and carcinogenesis. It is well established that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds either beta-catenin or plakoglobin, which both can assemble alpha-catenin into the complex. Recently we have identified an alpha-catenin binding site in beta-catenin and plakoglobin and postulated, based on sequence analysis, that these protein-protein interactions are mediated by a hydrophobic interaction mechanism. Here we have now identified the reciprocal complementary binding site in alpha-catenin which mediates its interaction with beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Using in vitro association assays with C-terminal truncations of alpha-catenin expressed as recombinant fusion proteins, we found that the N-terminal 146 amino acids are required for this interaction. We then identified a peptide of 27 amino acids within this sequence (amino acid positions 117-143) which is necessary and sufficient to bind beta-catenin or plakoglobin. As shown by mutational analysis, hydrophobic amino acids within this binding site are important for the interaction. The results described here, together with our previous work, give strong support for the idea that these proteins associate by hydrophobic interactions of two alpha-helices.

23299941|t|Dimerization of Sir3 via its C-terminal winged helix domain is essential for yeast heterochromatin formation.
23299941|t|Gene silencing in budding yeast relies on the binding of the Silent Information Regulator (Sir) complex to chromatin, which is mediated by extensive interactions between the Sir proteins and nucleosomes. Sir3, a divergent member of the AAA+ ATPase-like family, contacts both the histone H4 tail and the nucleosome core. Here, we present the structure and function of the conserved C-terminal domain of Sir3, comprising 138 amino acids. This module adopts a variant winged helix-turn-helix (wH) architecture that exists as a stable homodimer in solution. Mutagenesis shows that the self-association mediated by this domain is essential for holo-Sir3 dimerization. Its loss impairs Sir3 loading onto nucleosomes in vitro and eliminates silencing at telomeres and HM loci in vivo. Replacing the Sir3 wH domain with an unrelated bacterial dimerization motif restores both HM and telomeric repression in sir3/\ cells. In contrast, related wH domains of archaeal and human members of the Orc1/Sir3 family are monomeric and have DNA binding activity. We speculate that a dimerization function for the wH evolved with Sir3's ability to facilitate heterochromatin formation.

15601840|t|Composition and architecture of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad18 (Smc5-6) complex.
15601840|t|The rad18 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an essential gene that is involved in several different DNA repair processes. Rad18 (Smc6) is a member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family and, together with its SMC partner Spr18 (Smc5), forms the core of a high-molecular-weight complex. We show here that both S. pombe and human Smc5 and -6 interact through their hinge domains and that four independent temperature-sensitive mutants of Rad18 (Smc6) are all mutated at the same glycine residue in the hinge region. This mutation abolishes the interactions between the hinge regions of Rad18 (Smc6) and Spr18 (Smc5), as does mutation of a conserved glycine in the hinge region of Spr18 (Smc5). We purified the Smc5-6 complex from S. pombe and identified four non-SMC components, Nse1, Nse2, Nse3, and Rad62. Nse3 is a novel protein which is related to the mammalian MAGE protein family, many members of which are specifically expressed in cancer tissue. In initial steps to understand the architecture of the complex, we identified two subcomplexes containing Rad18-Spr18-Nse2 and Nse1-Nse3-Rad62. The subcomplexes are probably bridged by a weaker interaction between Nse2 and Nse3.

24351927|t|Parkinson-related LRRK2 mutation R1441C/G/H impairs PKA phosphorylation of LRRK2 and disrupts its interaction with 14-3-3.
24351927|t|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain protein implicated in Parkinson disease (PD); however, the molecular mechanism and mode of action of this protein remain elusive. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), along with other kinases, has been suggested to be an upstream kinase regulating LRRK2 function. Using MS, we detected several sites phosphorylated by PKA, including phosphorylation sites within the Ras of complex proteins (ROC) GTPase domain as well as some previously described sites (S910 and S935). We systematically mapped those sites within LRRK2 and investigated their functional consequences. S1444 in the ROC domain was confirmed as a target for PKA phosphorylation using ROC single-domain constructs and through site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation at S1444 is strikingly reduced in the major PD-related LRRK2 mutations R1441C/G/H, which are part of a consensus PKA recognition site ((1441)RASpS(1444)). Furthermore, our work establishes S1444 as a PKA-regulated 14-3-3 docking site. Experiments of direct binding to the three 14-3-3 isotypes gamma, theta, and zeta with phosphopeptides encompassing pS910, pS935, or pS1444 demonstrated the highest affinities to phospho-S1444. Strikingly, 14-3-3 binding to phospho-S1444 decreased LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro. Moreover, substitution of S1444 by alanine or by introducing the mutations R1441C/G/H, abrogating PKA phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, resulted in increased LRRK2 kinase activity. In conclusion, these data clearly demonstrate that LRRK2 kinase activity is modulated by PKA-mediated binding of 14-3-3 to S1444 and suggest that 14-3-3 interaction with LRRK2 is hampered in R1441C/G/H-mediated PD pathogenesis.

14669021|t|A proposed role for the Polycomb group protein dRING in meiotic sister-chromatid cohesion.
14669021|t|ORD protein is required for accurate chromosome segregation during male and female meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Null ord mutations result in random segregation of sister chromatids during both meiotic divisions because cohesion is completely abolished prior to kinetochore capture of microtubules during meiosis I. Previous analyses of mutant ord alleles have led us to propose that the C-terminal half of the ORD protein mediates protein-protein interactions that are essential for sister-chromatid cohesion. To identify proteins that interact with ORD, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using an ORD bait and isolated dRING, a core subunit of the Drosophila Polycomb repressive complex 1. We show that a missense mutation in ORD completely ablates the two-hybrid interaction with dRING and prevents nuclear retention of the mutant ORD protein in male meiotic cells. Using affinity-purified antibodies generated against full-length recombinant dRING, we demonstrate that dRING protein is expressed in the male and female gonads and colocalizes extensively with ORD on the chromatin of primary spermatocytes during G2 of meiosis. Our results suggest a novel role for the Polycomb group protein dRING and are consistent with the model that interaction of dRING and ORD is required to promote the proper segregation of meiotic chromosomes.

15930137|t|Insights into Lafora disease: malin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of laforin.
15930137|t|Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by recessive mutations in either a gene encoding a dual-specificity phosphatase, known as laforin, or a recently identified gene encoding the protein known as malin. Here, we demonstrate that malin is a single subunit E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase and that its RING domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate ubiquitination. Additionally, malin interacts with and polyubiquitinates laforin, leading to its degradation. Missense mutations in malin that are present in LD patients abolish its ability to polyubiquitinate and signal the degradation of laforin. Our results demonstrate that laforin is a physiologic substrate of malin, and we propose possible models to explain how recessive mutations in either malin or laforin result in LD. Furthermore, these data distinguish malin as an E3 Ub ligase whose activity is necessary to prevent a neurodegenerative disease that involves formation of nonproteinacious inclusion bodies.

19712061|t|Homo- and heterodimerization of ROCO kinases: LRRK2 kinase inhibition by the LRRK2 ROCO fragment.
19712061|t|Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant familial and late-onset sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is a large multi-domain protein featuring a GTP-binding C-terminal of Ras of complex proteins (ROC) (ROCO) domain combination unique for the ROCO protein family, directly followed by a kinase domain. Dimerization is a well-established phenomenon among protein kinases. Here, we confirm LRRK2 self-interaction, and provide evidence for general homo- and heterodimerization potential among the ROCO kinase family (LRRK2, LRRK1, and death-associated protein kinase 1). The ROCO domain was critically, though not exclusively involved in dimerization, as a LRRK2 deletion mutant lacking the ROCO domain retained dimeric properties. GTP binding did not appear to influence ROCO(LRRK2) self-interaction. Interestingly, ROCO(LRRK2) fragments exerted an inhibitory effect on both wild-type and the elevated G2019S LRRK2 autophosphorylation activity. Insertion of PD mutations into ROCO(LRRK2) reduced self-interaction and led to a reduction of LRRK2 kinase inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest a functional link between ROCO interactions and kinase activity of wild-type and mutant LRRK2. Importantly, our finding of ROCO(LRRK2) fragment-mediated LRRK2 kinase inhibition offers a novel lead for drug design and thus might have important implications for new therapeutic avenues in PD.

16571665|t|Fibrillin expression is regulated by abscisic acid response regulators and is involved in abscisic acid-mediated photoprotection.
16571665|t|Fibrillins are lipid-binding proteins of plastids that are induced under abiotic stress conditions. In response to environmental stress, plants generate abscisic acid (ABA) as an endogenous signal. We show that ABA treatment and fibrillin accumulation enhance the tolerance of photosystem II toward light stress-triggered photoinhibition in Arabidopsis. ABA induces fibrillin accumulation, and the ABA response regulators ABI1 and ABI2 regulate fibrillin expression. The abundance of fibrillin transcripts was specifically reduced in the ABA-insensitive abi1 mutant but not in the abi2 mutant. However, leaves of abi2 revealed in comparison to WT and abi1 enhanced fibrillin levels, pointing to a posttranscriptional control mechanism. Protein interaction analysis identified the protein phosphatase ABI2 to target the preprotein of fibrillin. Interaction was abrogated either by deleting the signal peptide of prefibrillin or by the single amino acid exchange present in the phosphatase-deficient abi2 protein. Thus, ABI1 and ABI2 seem to control fibrillin expression that is involved in mediating ABA-induced photoprotection.

27013965|t|Protective LRRK2 R1398H Variant Enhances GTPase and Wnt Signaling Activity.
27013965|t|Mutations in LRRK2 are a common cause of familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the LRRK2 GTPase domain R1398H variant was suggested in genetic studies to confer protection against PD but mechanistic data supporting this is lacking. Here, we present evidence that R1398H affects GTPase function, axon outgrowth, and Wnt signaling in a manner opposite to pathogenic LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 R1398H GTPase domain dimerization and GTP hydrolysis were increased whereas GTP binding was reduced, leading to a decrease in active GTP-bound LRRK2. This protective variant also increased axon length of primary cortical neurones in comparison to wild-type LRRK2, whereas the R1441G LRRK2 pathogenic mutant decreased axon outgrowth. Importantly, R1398H enhanced the stimulatory effect of LRRK2 on canonical Wnt signaling whereas the G2385R risk variant, in accordance with all previously tested pathogenic LRRK2 mutants, had the opposite effect. Molecular modeling placed R1398H in close proximity to PD-causing mutations suggesting that this protective LRRK2 variant, like familial mutations, affects intramolecular RocCOR domain interactions. Thus, our data suggest that R1398H LRRK2 is a bona fide protective variant. The opposite effects of protective versus PD associated LRRK2 variants on GTPase function and canonical Wnt signaling activity also suggests that regulation of these two basic signaling mechanisms is important for neuronal function. We conclude that LRRK2 mediated Wnt signaling and GTPase function are fundamental in conferring disease susceptibility and have clear implications for therapeutic target identification.

22493017|t|Identification of functionally important TonB-ExbD periplasmic domain interactions in vivo.
22493017|t|In gram-negative bacteria, the cytoplasmic membrane proton-motive force energizes the active transport of TonB-dependent ligands through outer membrane TonB-gated transporters. In Escherichia coli, cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD couple the proton-motive force to conformational changes in TonB, which are hypothesized to form the basis of energy transduction through direct contact with the transporters. While the role of ExbB is not well understood, contact between periplasmic domains of TonB and ExbD is required, with the conformational response of TonB to presence or absence of proton motive force being modulated through ExbD. A region (residues 92 to 121) within the ExbD periplasmic domain was previously identified as being important for TonB interaction. Here, the specific sites of periplasmic domain interactions between that region and the TonB carboxy terminus were identified by examining 270 combinations of 45 TonB and 6 ExbD individual cysteine substitutions for disulfide-linked heterodimer formation. ExbD residues A92C, K97C, and T109C interacted with multiple TonB substitutions in four regions of the TonB carboxy terminus. Two regions were on each side of the TonB residues known to interact with the TonB box of TonB-gated transporters, suggesting that ExbD positions TonB for correct interaction at that site. A third region contained a functionally important glycine residue, and the fourth region involved a highly conserved predicted amphipathic helix. Three ExbD substitutions, F103C, L115C, and T121C, were nonreactive with any TonB cysteine substitutions. ExbD D25, a candidate to be on a proton translocation pathway, was important to support efficient TonB-ExbD heterodimerization at these specific regions.

17586626|t|Assembly of the MexAB-OprM multidrug pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: component interactions defined by the study of pump mutant suppressors.
17586626|t|In an effort to identify key domains of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MexAB-OprM drug efflux system involved in component interactions, extragenic suppressors of various inactivating mutations in individual pump constituents were isolated and studied. The multidrug hypersusceptibility of P. aeruginosa expressing MexB with a mutation in a region of the protein implicated in oligomerization (G220S) was suppressed by mutations in the alpha/beta domain of MexA. MexB(G220S) showed a reduced ability to bind MexA in vivo while representative MexA suppressors (V66M and V259F) restored the MexA-MexB interaction. Interestingly, these suppressors also restored resistance in P. aeruginosa expressing OprM proteins with mutations at the proximal (periplasmic) tip of OprM that is predicted to interact with MexB, suggesting that these suppressors generally overcame defects in MexA-MexB and MexB-OprM interaction. The multidrug hypersusceptibility arising from a mutation in the helical hairpin of MexA implicated in OprM interaction (V129M) was suppressed by mutations (T198I and F439I) in the periplasmic alpha-helical barrel of OprM. Again, the MexA mutation compromised an in vivo interaction with OprM that was restored by the T198I and F439I substitutions in OprM, consistent with the hairpin domain mediating MexA binding to this region of OprM. Interestingly, these OprM suppressor mutations restored multidrug resistance in P. aeruginosa expressing MexB(G220S). Finally, the oprM(T198I) suppressor mutation enhanced the yields of all three constituents of a MexA-MexB-OprM(T198I) pump as detected in whole-cell extracts. These data highlight the importance of MexA and interactions with this adapter in promoting MexAB-OprM pump assembly and in stabilizing the pump complex.

15161910|t|Nucleolar Nek11 is a novel target of Nek2A in G1/S-arrested cells.
15161910|t|We previously reported that Nek11, a member of the NIMA (never-in-mitosis A) family of kinases, is activated in G(1)/S-arrested cells. We provide herein several lines of evidence for a novel interaction between Nek11 and Nek2A. Both Nek11 and Nek2A, but not Nek2B, were detected at nucleoli, and the Nek2A-specific C-terminal end (amino acids 399-445) was responsible for nucleolar localization. Endogenous Nek11 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Nek2A, and non-catalytic regions of each kinase were involved in the complex formation. Nek11L interacted with phosphorylated Nek2A but barely with the kinase-inactive Nek2A (K37R) mutant. In addition, both Nek2A autophosphorylation activity and the Nek11L-Nek2A complex formation increased in G(1)/S-arrested cells. These results indicate that autophosphorylation of Nek2A could stimulate its interaction with Nek11L at the nucleolus. Moreover, Nek2 directly phosphorylated Nek11 in the C-terminal non-catalytic region and elevated Nek11 kinase activity. The non-catalytic region of Nek11 showed autoinhibitory activity through intramolecular interaction with its N-terminal catalytic domain. Nek2 dissociated this autoinhibitory interaction. Altogether, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism of Nek11 activation by Nek2A in G(1)/S-arrested cells and suggest a novel possibility for nucleolar function of the NIMA family.

16267044|t|The plant plasma membrane Ca2+ pump ACA8 contains overlapping as well as physically separated autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains.
16267044|t|In plant Ca(2+) pumps belonging to the P(2B) subfamily of P-type ATPases, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is responsible for pump autoinhibition. Binding of calmodulin (CaM) to this region results in pump activation but the structural basis for CaM activation is still not clear. All residues in a putative CaM-binding domain (Arg(43) to Lys(68)) were mutagenized and the resulting recombinant proteins were studied with respect to CaM binding and the activation state. The results demonstrate that (i) the binding site for CaM is overlapping with the autoinhibitory region and (ii) the autoinhibitory region comprises significantly fewer residues than the CaM-binding region. In a helical wheel projection of the CaM-binding domain, residues involved in autoinhibition cluster on one side of the helix, which is proposed to interact with an intramolecular receptor site in the pump. Residues influencing CaM negatively are situated on the other face of the helix, likely to face the cytosol, whereas residues controlling CaM binding positively are scattered throughout. We propose that early CaM recognition is mediated by the cytosolic face and that CaM subsequently competes with the intramolecular autoinhibitor in binding to the other face of the helix.

22020124|t|The human microcephaly protein STIL interacts with CPAP and is required for procentriole formation.
22020124|t|Centriole duplication involves the growth of a procentriole next to the parental centriole. Mutations in STIL and CPAP/CENPJ cause primary microcephaly (MCPH). Here, we show that human STIL has an asymmetric localization to the daughter centriole and is required for procentriole formation. STIL levels oscillate during the cell cycle. Interestingly, STIL interacts directly with CPAP and forms a complex with hSAS6. A natural mutation of CPAP (E1235V) that causes MCPH in humans leads to significantly lower binding to STIL. Overexpression of STIL induced the formation of multiple procentrioles around the parental centriole. STIL depletion inhibited normal centriole duplication, Plk4-induced centriole amplification, and CPAP-induced centriole elongation, and resulted in a failure to localize hSAS6 and CPAP to the base of the nascent procentriole. Furthermore, hSAS6 depletion hindered STIL targeting to the procentriole, implying that STIL and hSAS6 are mutually dependent for their centriolar localization. Together, our results indicate that the two MCPH-associated proteins STIL and CPAP interact with each other and are required for procentriole formation, implying a central role of centriole biogenesis in MCPH.

19197237|t|Structural basis for competitive interactions of Pex14 with the import receptors Pex5 and Pex19.
19197237|t|Protein import into peroxisomes depends on a complex and dynamic network of protein-protein interactions. Pex14 is a central component of the peroxisomal import machinery and binds the soluble receptors Pex5 and Pex19, which have important function in the assembly of peroxisome matrix and membrane, respectively. We show that the N-terminal domain of Pex14, Pex14(N), adopts a three-helical fold. Pex5 and Pex19 ligand helices bind competitively to the same surface in Pex14(N) albeit with opposite directionality. The molecular recognition involves conserved aromatic side chains in the Pex5 WxxxF/Y motif and a newly identified F/YFxxxF sequence in Pex19. The Pex14-Pex5 complex structure reveals molecular details for a critical interaction in docking Pex5 to the peroxisomal membrane. We show that mutations of Pex14 residues located in the Pex5/Pex19 binding region disrupt Pex5 and/or Pex19 binding in vitro. The corresponding full-length Pex14 variants are impaired in peroxisomal membrane localisation in vivo, showing that the molecular interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain modulate peroxisomal targeting of Pex14.

19731236|t|Differential effects of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 mutations on canalicular localization of ATP8B1.
19731236|t|Mutations in ATP8B1 cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (BRIC1), forming a spectrum of cholestatic disease. Whereas PFIC1 is a progressive, endstage liver disease, BRIC1 patients suffer from episodic periods of cholestasis that resolve spontaneously. At present it is not clear how the type and location of the mutations relate to the clinical manifestations of PFIC1 and BRIC1. ATP8B1 localizes to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes where it mediates the inward translocation of phosphatidylserine. ATP8B1 interacts with CDC50A, which is required for endoplasmic reticulum exit and plasma membrane localization. In this study we analyzed a panel of missense mutations causing PFIC1 (G308V, D554N, G1040R) or BRIC1 (D70N, I661T). In addition, we included two mutations that have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (D70N, R867C). We examined the effect of these mutations on protein stability and interaction with CDC50A in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and studied the subcellular localization in WIF-B9 cells. Protein stability was reduced for three out of six mutations studied. Two out of three PFIC1 mutant proteins did not interact with CDC50A, whereas BRIC1/ICP mutants displayed reduced interaction. Importantly, none of the PFIC1 mutants were detectable in the canalicular membrane of WIF-B9 cells, whereas all BRIC1/ICP mutants displayed the same cellular staining pattern as wild-type ATP8B1. Our data indicate that PFIC1 mutations lead to the complete absence of canalicular expression, whereas in BRIC1/ICP residual protein is expressed in the canalicular membrane. CONCLUSION: These data provide an explanation for the difference in severity between the phenotypes of PFIC1 and BRIC1.

25036739|t|Altered RyR2 regulation by the calmodulin F90L mutation associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and early sudden cardiac death.
25036739|t|Calmodulin (CaM) association with the cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR2) regulates excitation-contraction coupling. Defective CaM-RyR2 interaction is associated with heart failure. A novel CaM mutation (CaM(F90L)) was recently identified in a family with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and early onset sudden cardiac death. We report the first biochemical characterization of CaM(F90L). F90L confers a deleterious effect on protein stability. Ca(2+)-binding studies reveal reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity and a loss of co-operativity. Moreover, CaM(F90L) displays reduced RyR2 interaction and defective modulation of [(3)H]ryanodine binding. Hence, dysregulation of RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release via aberrant CaM(F90L)-RyR2 interaction is a potential mechanism that underlies familial IVF.

11591686|t|Bacterial two-hybrid analysis of interactions between region 4 of the sigma(70) subunit of RNA polymerase and the transcriptional regulators Rsd from Escherichia coli and AlgQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
11591686|t|A number of transcriptional regulators mediate their effects through direct contact with the sigma(70) subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP). In particular, several regulators have been shown to contact a C-terminal portion of sigma(70) that harbors conserved region 4. This region of sigma contains a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif that contacts the -35 element of sigma(70)-dependent promoters directly. Here we report the use of a recently developed bacterial two-hybrid system to study the interaction between the putative anti-sigma factor Rsd and the sigma(70) subunit of E. coli RNAP. Using this system, we found that Rsd can interact with an 86-amino-acid C-terminal fragment of sigma(70) and also that amino acid substitution R596H, within region 4 of sigma(70), weakens this interaction. We demonstrated the specificity of this effect by showing that substitution R596H does not weaken the interaction between sigma and two other regulators shown previously to contact region 4 of sigma(70). We also demonstrated that AlgQ, a homolog of Rsd that positively regulates virulence gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can contact the C-terminal region of the sigma(70) subunit of RNAP from this organism. We found that amino acid substitution R600H in sigma(70) from P. aeruginosa, corresponding to the R596H substitution in E. coli sigma(70), specifically weakens the interaction between AlgQ and sigma(70). Taken together, our findings suggest that Rsd and AlgQ contact similar surfaces of RNAP present in region 4 of sigma(70) and probably regulate gene expression through this contact.

19515790|t|ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE2 acts with ROOT UV-B SENSITIVE1 in a root ultraviolet B-sensing pathway.
19515790|t|Ultraviolet B light (UV-B; 280-320 nm) perception and signaling are well-known phenomena in plants, although no specific UV-B photoreceptors have yet been identified. We previously reported on the root UV-B sensitive1 (rus1) mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which display a block to development under very-low-fluence-rate UV-B (<0.1 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) after the seedling emerges from the seed. Here, we report the analysis and cloning of the rus2-1 mutation in Arabidopsis. The phenotype of rus2-1 mutant seedlings is virtually indistinguishable from the phenotype of rus1 seedlings. A map-based approach was used to clone RUS2. RUS2 encodes a domain of unknown function (DUF647)-containing protein that is homologous to the RUS1 protein. rus1-2 rus2-1 double mutant seedlings have the same phenotype as both rus1 and rus2 single mutants, suggesting that the two genes work in the same pathway. RUS2-Green Fluorescent Protein shows a similar expression pattern as that of RUS1-Green Fluorescent Protein, and RUS1 and RUS2 proteins interact physically in yeast. This protein-protein interaction depends on the DUF647 domain, and site-directed mutagenesis identified specific residues in DUF647 that are required for both protein-protein interaction and physiological function. Six RUS genes are found in Arabidopsis, rice (Oryza sativa), and moss (Physcomitrella patens), and one RUS member, RUS3, is conserved in plants and animals. Our results demonstrate that RUS2 works with RUS1 in a root UV-B-sensing pathway that plays a vital role in Arabidopsis early seedling morphogenesis and development.

16831423|t|Abl kinase interacts with and phosphorylates vinexin.
16831423|t|Non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl is a well known regulator of the actin-cytoskeleton, including the formation of stress fibers and membrane ruffles. Vinexin is an adapter protein consisting of three SH3 domains, and involved in signal transduction and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we found that vinexin alpha as well as beta interacts with c-Abl mainly through the third SH3 domain, and that vinexin and c-Abl were colocalized at membrane ruffles in rat astrocytes. This interaction was reduced by latrunculin B, suggesting an F-actin-mediated regulatory mechanism. We also found that vinexin alpha but not beta was phosphorylated at tyrosine residue when c-Abl or v-Abl was co-expressed. A mutational analysis identified tyrosine 127 on vinexin alpha as a major site of phosphorylation by c- or v-Abl. These results suggest that vinexin alpha is a novel substrate for Abl.

8670882|t|Identification of a novel Rac1-interacting protein involved in membrane ruffling.
8670882|t|The Rac GTP binding proteins are implicated in actin cytoskeleton-membrane interaction in mammalian cells. In fibroblast cells, Rac has been shown to mediate growth factor-induced polymerization of actin to form membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. We report here the isolation of a noval Rac1-interacting protein, POR1. POR1 binds directly to Rac1, and the interaction of POR1 with Rac1 is GTP dependent. A mutation in the Rac1 effector binding loop shown to abolish membrane ruffling also abolishes interaction with POR1. Truncated versions of POR1 inhibit the induction of membrane ruffling by an activated mutant of Rac1, V12Rac1, in quiescent rat embryonic fibroblast REF52 cells. Furthermore, POR1 synergizes with an activated mutant of Ras, V12Ras, in the induction of membrane ruffling. These results suggest a potential role for POR1 in Rac1-mediated signaling pathways.

24469399|t|Mechanism underlying IkB kinase activation mediated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex.
24469399|t|The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) ligase, consisting of HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN, specifically generates linear polyubiquitin chains. LUBAC-mediated linear polyubiquitination has been implicated in NF-kB activation. NEMO, a component of the IkB kinase (IKK) complex, is a substrate of LUBAC, but the precise molecular mechanism underlying linear chain-mediated NF-kB activation has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polyubiquitinated NEMO activates IKK more potently than unanchored linear chains. In mutational analyses based on the crystal structure of the complex between the HOIP NZF1 and NEMO CC2-LZ domains, which are involved in the HOIP-NEMO interaction, NEMO mutations that impaired linear ubiquitin recognition activity and prevented recognition by LUBAC synergistically suppressed signal-induced NF-kB activation. HOIP NZF1 bound to NEMO and ubiquitin simultaneously, and HOIP NZF1 mutants defective in interaction with either NEMO or ubiquitin could not restore signal-induced NF-kB activation. Furthermore, linear chain-mediated activation of IKK2 involved homotypic interaction of the IKK2 kinase domain. Collectively, these results demonstrate that linear polyubiquitination of NEMO plays crucial roles in IKK activation and that this modification involves the HOIP NZF1 domain and recognition of NEMO-conjugated linear ubiquitin chains by NEMO on another IKK complex.

12414623|t|Functional alterations of human exonuclease 1 mutants identified in atypical hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome.
12414623|t|Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by germ-line mutations in one of several DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, most commonly in hMSH2 and hMLH1. Human exonuclease 1 (hExo1) possesses both 5'exonuclease and flap endonuclease activities and plays a role in DNA repair, recombination, and replication. The enzyme interacts with MMR proteins, hMsh2, hMlh1, and hMsh3. Recently, eight missense mutations in hEXO1 were identified in atypical HNPCC patients, who have been screened to be negative for hMSH2, hMLH1, and hMSH6 mutations. To address the question of whether these mutations cause susceptibility to HNPCC, in vitro nuclease activity and protein-protein interaction assays were performed in this study. We found that two mutants, E109K and L410R, lost their exonuclease activities while retaining their capacity to bind to the DNA substrate. Three other mutants, P640S, G759E, and P770L, displayed a reduced capacity to interact with hMsh2. The combination of these three point mutations leads to the binding capacity with hMsh2 to nearly zero. Evidence made available in this study sheds light on the pathogenesis of HNPCC, perhaps initiated by an additional MMR gene, hEXO1.

16278047|t|Characterization of FBX25, encoding a novel brain-expressed F-box protein.
16278047|t|F-box proteins (FBPs) confer substrate specificity to the SCF-type (Skp1/Cul1/FBP) of ubiquitin ligase complexes through their F-box. Multiple FBPs have been predicted, but experimental evidence is lagging. We report on the predicted human FBP hFBX25 which we found to be disrupted in a mentally retarded translocation carrier suffering from epileptic seizures. We investigated hFBX25's genomic organization and established hFBX25 as an FBP by verifying its interaction with Skp1 and Cul1. In the process, we identified an atypical serine residue in the F-box which is crucial for the hFBX25-Skp1 binding. We determined hFBX25's subcellular localization. We found strong transcription in human brain. In mouse embryonic sections, mFbx25 shows predominantly neuronal expression and in adult mouse brain, expression is confined to the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and the Purkinje cell layer. Interestingly, aberrations in the ubiquitin pathway have been linked to neurological conditions.

11265755|t|Synergy between estrogen receptor alpha activation functions AF1 and AF2 mediated by transcription intermediary factor TIF2.
11265755|t|The activation function AF2 in the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta signals through the recruitment of nuclear receptor coactivators. Recent evidence indicates that coactivators, such as the transcription intermediary factor TIF2, also bind to and transactivate the N-terminal AF1 function of the two ERs. We have generated TIF2 mutant proteins that are deficient in either AF1 or AF2 interaction and use these mutants to investigate the relative contribution of both AFs to TIF2 recruitment and transactivation. We observe that TIF2 is capable of interacting simultaneously with both the isolated N- and C-terminus of ER alpha in transfected mammalian cells and in vitro, indicating that TIF2 can bridge both receptor domains. The concomitant interaction of TIF2 with both AFs results in synergistic activation of transcription. Thus, synergy between ER alpha AF1 and AF2 is a result of the cooperative recruitment of TIF2 and/or other members of the p160 coactivator family.

20935625|t|Direct dynamin-actin interactions regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
20935625|t|The large GTPase dynamin assembles into higher order structures that are thought to promote endocytosis. Dynamin also regulates the actin cytoskeleton through an unknown, GTPase-dependent mechanism. Here, we identify a highly conserved site in dynamin that binds directly to actin filaments and aligns them into bundles. Point mutations in the actin-binding domain cause aberrant membrane ruffling and defective actin stress fibre formation in cells. Short actin filaments promote dynamin assembly into higher order structures, which in turn efficiently release the actin-capping protein (CP) gelsolin from barbed actin ends in vitro, allowing for elongation of actin filaments. Together, our results support a model in which assembled dynamin, generated through interactions with short actin filaments, promotes actin polymerization via displacement of actin-CPs.

15175337|t|Heme oxygenase-2 is activated by calcium-calmodulin.
15175337|t|The heme oxygenase family of enzymes catalyzes the metabolism of heme to biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). At least two isoforms exist, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), which are encoded by separate genes. HO2 is selectively enriched in neurons, and substantial evidence suggests that HO2-derived CO functions as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. However, a molecular mechanism for the rapid activation of HO2 during neuronal activity has not been described. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified calmodulin as a potential regulator of HO2 activity. Calmodulin binds with nanomolar affinity to HO2 in a calcium-dependent manner via a canonical 1-10 motif, resulting in a 3-fold increase in catalytic activity. Mutations within this motif block calmodulin binding and calcium-dependent stimulation of enzyme activity in vitro and in intact cells. The calcium mobilizing agents ionomycin and glutamate stimulate endogenous HO2 activity in primary cortical cultures, establishing in vivo relevance. Calcium-calmodulin provides a mechanism for rapid and transient activation of HO2 during neuronal activity.

12917342|t|BAF60a mediates critical interactions between nuclear receptors and the BRG1 chromatin-remodeling complex for transactivation.
12917342|t|Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators that modulate chromatin structure. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which receptors recruit chromatin-remodeling activity are not fully elucidated. We show that in the absence of its ligand-binding domain, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is able to interact with both nuclear receptor coactivators and the BRG1 chromatin-remodeling complex in vivo. Individually, the GR makes direct interactions with BRG1-associated factor 60a (BAF60a) and BAF57, but not with BRG1, BAF155, or BAF170. Further, BAF60a possesses at least two interaction surfaces, one for GR and BRG1 and a second for BAF155 and BAF170. A GR mutant, GR(R488Q), that fails to interact with BAF60a in vitro has reduced chromatin-remodeling activity and reduced transcriptional activity from the promoter assembled as chromatin in vivo. Stable expression of a BAF60a truncation mutant, BAF60a4-140, caused chromatin-specific loss of GR functions in vivo. In the presence of the BAF60a mutant, the GR fails to interact with the BRG1 complex and consequently is also deficient in its ability to activate transcription from chromatin. Thus, in addition to previously identified BAF250, BAF60a may provide another critical and direct link between nuclear receptors and the BRG1 complex that is required for promoter recruitment and subsequent chromatin remodeling.

21765395|t|Nedd4-1 binds and ubiquitylates activated FGFR1 to control its endocytosis and function.
21765395|t|Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) has critical roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation during animal development and adult homeostasis. Here, we show that human Nedd4 (Nedd4-1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase comprised of a C2 domain, 4 WW domains, and a Hect domain, regulates endocytosis and signalling of FGFR1. Nedd4-1 binds directly to and ubiquitylates activated FGFR1, by interacting primarily via its WW3 domain with a novel non-canonical sequence (non-PY motif) on FGFR1. Deletion of this recognition motif (FGFR1-/\6) abolishes Nedd4-1 binding and receptor ubiquitylation, and impairs endocytosis of activated receptor, as also observed upon Nedd4-1 knockdown. Accordingly, FGFR1-/\6, or Nedd4-1 knockdown, exhibits sustained FGF-dependent receptor Tyr phosphorylation and downstream signalling (activation of FRS2a, Akt, Erk1/2, and PLCy). Expression of FGFR1-/\6 in human embryonic neural stem cells strongly promotes FGF2-dependent neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, expression of this FGFR1-/\6 mutant in zebrafish embryos disrupts anterior neuronal patterning (head development), consistent with excessive FGFR1 signalling. These results identify Nedd4-1 as a key regulator of FGFR1 endocytosis and signalling during neuronal differentiation and embryonic development.

17626883|t|Mechanism of two classes of cancer mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit.
17626883|t|Many human cancers involve up-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3Kalpha, with oncogenic mutations identified in both the p110alpha catalytic and the p85alpha regulatory subunits. We used crystallographic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into activating mutations in two noncatalytic p110alpha domains-the adaptor-binding and the helical domains. A structure of the adaptor-binding domain of p110alpha in a complex with the p85alpha inter-Src homology 2 (inter-SH2) domain shows that oncogenic mutations in the adaptor-binding domain are not at the inter-SH2 interface but in a polar surface patch that is a plausible docking site for other domains in the holo p110/p85 complex. We also examined helical domain mutations and found that the Glu545 to Lys545 (E545K) oncogenic mutant disrupts an inhibitory charge-charge interaction with the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain. These studies extend our understanding of the architecture of PI3Ks and provide insight into how two classes of mutations that cause a gain in function can lead to cancer.

17170703|t|A novel function of caspase-8 in the regulation of androgen-receptor-driven gene expression.
17170703|t|Transcriptional regulation by the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for male sexual development and prostate cancer. In this study, we used an expression cloning strategy to identify molecules that regulate AR-driven transcription. Screening of a human cDNA library resulted in isolation of caspase-8 (Casp8), an initiator caspase that mediates death-receptor-induced apoptosis. Casp8 repressed AR-dependent gene expression independently of its apoptotic protease activity by disrupting AR amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal (N/C) interaction and inhibiting androgen-induced AR nuclear localization. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that three motifs in Casp8 specifically interacted with the motifs that are known to be involved in AR N/C interaction. Substitutions of the amino-acid residues critical for AR-Casp8 interactions abolished the Casp8-mediated inhibition of AR transactivation. In addition, knockdown of Casp8 by RNA interference specifically affected the androgen-dependent expression of AR-targeting genes in LNCaP cells. These results indicate that Casp8 has a novel function beyond its known role in the mediation of apoptosis.

21220045|t|A novel desmocollin-2 mutation reveals insights into the molecular link between desmosomes and gap junctions.
21220045|t|BACKGROUND: Cellular adhesion mediated by cardiac desmosomes is a prerequisite for proper electric propagation mediated by gap junctions in the myocardium. However, the molecular principles underlying this interdependence are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine potential causes of right ventricular conduction abnormalities in a patient with borderline diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. METHODS: To assess molecular changes, the patient's myocardial tissue was analyzed for altered desmosomal and gap junction (connexin43) protein levels and localization. In vitro functional studies were performed to characterize the consequences of the desmosomal mutations. RESULTS: Loss of plakoglobin signal was evident at the cell junctions despite expression of the protein at control levels. Although the distribution of connexin43 was not altered, total protein levels were reduced and changes in phosphorylation were observed. The truncation mutant in desmocollin-2a is deficient in binding plakoglobin. Moreover, the ability of desmocollin-2a to directly interact with connexin43 was abolished by the mutation. No pathogenic potential of the desmoglein-2 missense change was identified. CONCLUSION: The observed abnormalities in gap junction protein expression and phosphorylation, which precede an overt cardiac phenotype, likely are responsible for slow myocardial conduction in this patient. At the molecular level, altered binding properties of the desmocollin-2a mutant may contribute to the changes in connexin43.

19033529|t|HAB1-SWI3B interaction reveals a link between abscisic acid signaling and putative SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in Arabidopsis.
19033529|t|Abscisic acid (ABA) has an important role for plant growth, development, and stress adaptation. HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1) is a protein phosphatase type 2C that plays a key role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling; however, the molecular details of HAB1 action in this process are not known. A two-hybrid screen revealed that SWI3B, an Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the yeast SWI3 subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, is a prevalent interacting partner of HAB1. The interaction mapped to the N-terminal half of SWI3B and required an intact protein phosphatase catalytic domain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction of HAB1 and SWI3B in the nucleus of plant cells. swi3b mutants showed a reduced sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination and growth and reduced expression of the ABA-responsive genes RAB18 and RD29B. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the presence of HAB1 in the vicinity of RD29B and RAB18 promoters was abolished by ABA, which suggests a direct involvement of HAB1 in the regulation of ABA-induced transcription. Additionally, our results uncover SWI3B as a novel positive regulator of ABA signaling and suggest that HAB1 modulates ABA response through the regulation of a putative SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.

17054981|t|Solution structure of NOD1 CARD and mutational analysis of its interaction with the CARD of downstream kinase RICK.
17054981|t|NOD1 is a cytosolic signalling host pattern-recognition receptor composed of a caspase-activating and recruitment domain (CARD), a nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) and leucine-rich repeats. It plays a crucial role in innate immunity by activating the NF-kappaB pathway via its downstream effector the kinase RICK (RIP2) following the recognition of a specific bacterial ligand. RICK is recruited by NOD1 through interaction of their respective CARDs. Here we present the high resolution NMR structure of the NOD1 CARD. It is generally similar to other CARDs of known structure, consisting of six tightly packed helices, although the length and orientation of the last helix is unusual. Mutations in both the NOD1 and RICK CARD domains were assayed by immuno-precipitation of cell lysates and in vivo NF-kappaB activation in order to define residues important for CARD-CARD interaction and downstream signalling. The results show that the interaction is critically dependent on three acidic residues on NOD1 CARD and three basic residues on RICK CARD and thus is likely to have a strong electrostatic component, similar to other characterised CARD-CARD interactions.

16148006|t|ERK2 shows a restrictive and locally selective mechanism of recognition by its tyrosine phosphatase inactivators not shared by its activator MEK1.
16148006|t|The two regulatory residues that control the enzymatic activity of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 are phosphorylated by the unique MAP kinase kinases MEK1/2 and dephosphorylated by several tyrosine-specific and dual specificity protein phosphatases. Selective docking interactions facilitate these phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, controlling the specificity and duration of the MAP kinase activation-inactivation cycles. We have analyzed the contribution of specific residues of ERK2 in the physical and functional interaction with the ERK2 phosphatase inactivators PTP-SL and MKP-3 and with its activator MEK1. Single mutations in ERK2 that abrogated the dephosphorylation by endogenous tyrosine phosphatases from HEK293 cells still allowed efficient phosphorylation by endogenous MEK1/2. Discrete ERK2 mutations at the ERK2 docking groove differentially affected binding and inactivation by PTP-SL and MKP-3. Remarkably, the cytosolic retention of ERK2 by its activator MEK1 was not affected by any of the analyzed ERK2 single amino acid substitutions. A chimeric MEK1 protein, containing the kinase interaction motif of PTP-SL, bound tightly to ERK2 through its docking groove and behaved as a gain-of-function MAP kinase kinase that hyperactivated ERK2. Our results provide evidence that the ERK2 docking groove is more restrictive and selective for its tyrosine phosphatase inactivators than for MEK1/2 and indicate that distinct ERK2 residues modulate the docking interactions with activating and inactivating effectors.

16284401|t|Identification of a switch in neurotrophin signaling by selective tyrosine phosphorylation.
16284401|t|Neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinases through receptor dimerization at the cell surface followed by autophosphorylation and recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules. The intracellular pathways used by neurotrophins share many common protein substrates that are used by other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as Shc, Grb2, FRS2, and phospholipase C-gamma. Here we describe a novel RTK mechanism that involves a 220-kilodalton membrane tetraspanning protein, ARMS/Kidins220, which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in primary neurons after neurotrophin treatment. ARMS/Kidins220 undergoes multiple tyrosine phosphorylation events and also serine phosphorylation by protein kinase D. We have identified a single tyrosine (Tyr(1096)) phosphorylation event in ARMS/Kidins220 that plays a critical role in neurotrophin signaling. A reassembled complex of ARMS/Kidins220 and CrkL, an upstream component of the C3G-Rap1-MAP kinase cascade, is SH3-dependent. However, Tyr(1096) phosphorylation enables ARMS/Kidins220 to recruit CrkL through its SH2 domain, thereby freeing the CrkL SH3 domain to engage C3G for MAP kinase activation in a neurotrophin dependent manner. Accordingly, mutation of Tyr(1096) abolished CrkL interaction and sustained MAPK kinase activity, a response that is not normally observed in other RTKs. Therefore, Trk receptor signaling involves an inducible switch mechanism through an unconventional substrate that distinguishes neurotrophin action from other growth factor receptors.

21262861|t|SHOX interacts with the chondrogenic transcription factors SOX5 and SOX6 to activate the aggrecan enhancer.
21262861|t|SHOX (short stature homeobox-containing gene) encodes a transcription factor implicated in skeletal development. SHOX haploinsufficiency has been demonstrated in Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), a skeletal dysplasia associated with disproportionate short stature, as well as in a variable proportion of cases with idiopathic short stature (ISS). In order to gain insight into the SHOX signalling pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify SHOX-interacting proteins. Two transcription factors, SOX5 and SOX6, were identified. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the existence of the SHOX-SOX5 and SHOX-SOX6 interactions in human cells, whereas immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the coexpression of these proteins in 18- and 32-week human fetal growth plates. The SHOX homeodomain and the SOX6 HMG domain were shown to be implicated in the SHOX-SOX6 interaction. Moreover, different SHOX missense mutations, identified in LWD and ISS patients, disrupted this interaction. The physiological importance of these interactions was investigated by studying the effect of SHOX on a transcriptional target of the SOX trio, Agc1, which encodes one of the main components of cartilage, aggrecan. Our results show that SHOX cooperates with SOX5/SOX6 and SOX9 in the activation of the upstream Agc1 enhancer and that SHOX mutations affect this activation. In conclusion, we have identified SOX5 and SOX6 as the first two SHOX-interacting proteins and have shown that this interaction regulates aggrecan expression, an essential factor in chondrogenesis and skeletal development.

10202051|t|Mutations that cause the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome impair the interaction of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) with WASP interacting protein.
10202051|t|Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, immune deficiency, and a proclivity toward lymphoid malignancy. Lymphocytes of affected individuals show defects of activation, motility, and cytoskeletal structure. The disease gene encodes a 502-amino acid protein named the WAS protein (WASP). Studies have identified a number of important interactions that place WASP in a role of integrating signaling pathways with cytoskeletal function. We performed a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with WASP and cloned a proline-rich protein as a specific WASP interactor. Our clone of this protein, termed WASP interacting protein (WIP) by others, shows a difference in seven amino acid residues, compared with the previously published sequence revealing an additional profilin binding motif. Deletion mutant analysis reveals that WASP residues 101-151 are necessary for WASP-WIP interaction. Point mutant analyses in the two-hybrid system and in vitro show impairment of WASP-WIP interaction with three WASP missense mutants known to cause WAS. We conclude that impaired WASP-WIP interaction may contribute to WAS.

12432066|t|Assembly of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex precedes and is essential for localization of each component to cell-matrix adhesion sites.
12432066|t|PINCH, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and calponin homology-containing ILK-binding protein (CH-ILKBP) form a ternary complex that plays crucial roles at cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites. To understand the mechanism underlying the complex formation and recruitment to cell-adhesion sites we have undertaken a combined structural, mutational and cell biological analysis. Three-dimensional structure-based point mutations identified specific PINCH and ILK sites that mediate the complex formation. Analyses of the binding defective point mutants revealed that the assembly of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex is essential for their localization to cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites. The formation of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex precedes integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase C, but not that of actin polymerization, inhibited the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex formation, suggesting that the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex likely serves as a downstream effector of protein kinase C in the cellular control of focal adhesion assembly. Finally, we provide evidence that the formation of the PINCH-ILK-CH-ILKBP complex, while necessary, is not sufficient for ILK localization to cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the assembly and regulation of cell-matrix adhesion structures.

10659709|t|NPR1 differentially interacts with members of the TGA/OBF family of transcription factors that bind an element of the PR-1 gene required for induction by salicylic acid.
10659709|t|NPR1 is a critical component of the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signal transduction pathway leading to the induction of defense genes, such as the pathogenesis-related (PR)-1 gene, and enhanced disease resistance. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified several NPR1-interacting proteins (NIPs). Two of these NIPs are members of the TGA/OBF family of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors; this family has been implicated in the activation of SA-responsive genes, including PR-1. Six TGA family members were tested and shown to differentially interact with NPR1: TGA2 and TGA3 showed strong affinity for NPR1; TGA5 and TGA6 exhibited weaker affinity; and TGA1 and TGA4 displayed little or no detectable interaction with NPR1, respectively. Interestingly, the amino-termini of these factors were found to decrease their stability in yeast and differentially affect their apparent affinity toward NPR1. The interacting regions on NPR1 and the TGA factors were also defined. Each of four point mutations in NPR1 that disrupt SA signaling in Arabidopsis completely blocked interaction of NPR1 with TGA2 and TGA3. TGA2 and TGA3 were also found to bind the SA-responsive element of the Arabidopsis PR-1 promoter. These results directly link NPR1 to SA-induced PR-1 expression through members of the TGA family of transcription factors.

15150219|t|Interactions between the nitrogen signal transduction protein PII and N-acetyl glutamate kinase in organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis.
15150219|t|PII, one of the most conserved signal transduction proteins, is believed to be a key player in the coordination of nitrogen assimilation and carbon metabolism in bacteria, archaea, and plants. However, the identity of PII receptors remains elusive, particularly in photosynthetic organisms. Here we used yeast two-hybrid approaches to identify new PII receptors and to explore the extent of conservation of PII signaling mechanisms between eubacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes. Screening of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 libraries with PII as bait resulted in identification of N-acetyl glutamate kinase (NAGK), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of arginine. The integrity of Ser49, a residue conserved in PII proteins from organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, appears to be essential for NAGK binding. The effect of glnB mutations on NAGK activity is consistent with positive regulation of NAGK by PII. Phylogenetic and yeast two-hybrid analyses strongly suggest that there was conservation of the NAGK-PII regulatory interaction in the evolution of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, providing insight into the function of eukaryotic PII-like proteins.

19933576|t|Mammalian SUN protein interaction networks at the inner nuclear membrane and their role in laminopathy disease processes.
19933576|t|The nuclear envelope (NE) LINC complex, in mammals comprised of SUN domain and nesprin proteins, provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular rigidity. SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A, but lamin A is only required for NE localization of SUN2, and it remains unclear how SUN1 is anchored. Here, we identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of SUN1/2. These have overlapping binding sites distinct from the lamin A binding site. However, we demonstrate that tight association of SUN1 with the nuclear lamina depends upon a short motif within residues 209-228, a region that does not interact significantly with known SUN1 binding partners. Moreover, SUN1 localizes correctly in cells lacking emerin. Importantly then, the major determinant of SUN1 NE localization has yet to be identified. We further find that a subset of lamin A mutations, associated with laminopathies Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), disrupt lamin A interaction with SUN1 and SUN2. Despite this, NE localization of SUN1 and SUN2 is not impaired in cell lines from either class of patients. Intriguingly, SUN1 expression at the NE is instead enhanced in a significant proportion of HGPS but not EDMD cells and strongly correlates with pre-lamin A accumulation due to preferential interaction of SUN1 with pre-lamin A. We propose that these different perturbations in lamin A-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.

18583962|t|Implementing the LIM code: the structural basis for cell type-specific assembly of LIM-homeodomain complexes.
18583962|t|LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factors form a combinatorial 'LIM code' that contributes to the specification of cell types. In the ventral spinal cord, the binary LIM homeobox protein 3 (Lhx3)/LIM domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb1) complex specifies the formation of V2 interneurons. The additional expression of islet-1 (Isl1) in adjacent cells instead specifies the formation of motor neurons through assembly of a ternary complex in which Isl1 contacts both Lhx3 and Ldb1, displacing Lhx3 as the binding partner of Ldb1. However, little is known about how this molecular switch occurs. Here, we have identified the 30-residue Lhx3-binding domain on Isl1 (Isl1(LBD)). Although the LIM interaction domain of Ldb1 (Ldb1(LID)) and Isl1(LBD) share low levels of sequence homology, X-ray and NMR structures reveal that they bind Lhx3 in an identical manner, that is, Isl1(LBD) mimics Ldb1(LID). These data provide a structural basis for the formation of cell type-specific protein-protein interactions in which unstructured linear motifs with diverse sequences compete to bind protein partners. The resulting alternate protein complexes can target different genes to regulate key biological events.

24805197|t|The arrhythmogenic human HRC point mutation S96A leads to spontaneous Ca(2+) release due to an impaired ability to buffer store Ca(2+).
24805197|t|The Ser96Ala (S96A) mutation within the histidine rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. However, the molecular mechanism connecting the S96A mutation of HRC to increased Ca(2+) release events remains unclear. Previous findings by our group indicate that these spontaneous Ca(2+) release events may be linked to store overload induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) via the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Therefore, in the present study we sought to determine whether HRC wild type (HRC WT) and S96A mutant (HRC S96A) expression has a direct effect on SOICR. Using both cytosolic and intra-Ca(2+) store measurements in human embryonic kidney cells expressing RyR2, we found that HRC WT significantly inhibited the propensity for SOICR by buffering store free Ca(2+) and inhibiting store Ca(2+) uptake. In contrast, HRC S96A exhibited a markedly suppressed inhibitory effect on SOICR, which was attributed to an impaired ability to buffer store Ca(2+) and reduce store Ca(2+) uptake. In addition to impairing the ability of HRC to regulate bulk store Ca(2+), a proximity ligation assay demonstrated that the S96A mutation also disrupts the Ca(2+) microdomain around the RyR2, as it alters the Ca(2+) dependent association of RyR2 and HRC. Importantly, in contrast to previous reports, the absence of triadin in our experimental model illustrates that the S96A mutation in HRC can alter the propensity for SOICR without any interaction with triadin. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the human HRC mutation S96A leads to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release and ultimately arrhythmias by disrupting the regulation of intra-store free Ca(2+). This is primarily due to an impaired ability to act as an effective bulk and local microdomain store Ca(2+) buffer.

11278685|t|Physical interaction with Yes-associated protein enhances p73 transcriptional activity.
11278685|t|Specific protein-protein interactions are involved in a large number of cellular processes and are mainly mediated by structurally and functionally defined domains. Here we report that the nuclear phosphoprotein p73 can engage in a physical association with the Yes-associated protein (YAP). This association occurs under physiological conditions as shown by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of complexes from lysates of P19 cells. The WW domain of YAP and the PPPPY motif of p73 are directly involved in the association. Furthermore, as required for ligands to group I WW domains, the terminal tyrosine (Y) of the PPPPY motif of p73 was shown to be essential for the association with YAP. Unlike p73alpha, p73beta, and p63alpha, which bind to YAP, the endogenous as well as exogenously expressed wild-type p53 (wt-p53) and the p73gamma isoform do not interact with YAP. Indeed, we documented that YAP interacts only with those members of the p53 family that have a well conserved PPXY motif, a target sequence for WW domains. Overexpression of YAP causes an increase of p73alpha transcriptional activity. Differential interaction of YAP with members of the p53 family may provide a molecular explanation for their functional divergence in signaling.

18192679|t|Huntingtin-associated protein-1 is a modifier of the age-at-onset of Huntington's disease.
18192679|t|A polyglutamine repeat expansion of more than 36 units in a protein called huntingtin (htt) is the only known cause of Huntington's disease (HD). The expanded repeat length is inversely correlated with the age-at-onset (AAO), however, the onset age among HD patients with CAG repeats below 60 units varies considerably. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors different from the expanded CAG repeat length can modify the AAO of HD. We hypothezised that htt interacting proteins might contribute to this variation in the AAO and investigated human htt-associated protein-1 (HAP1) using genetic and functional assays. We identified six polymorphisms in the HAP1 gene including one that substitutes methionine (M441) for threonine (T441) at amino acid 441. Analyzing 980 European HD patients, we found that patients homozygous for the M441 genotype show an 8-year delay in the AAO. Functional assays demonstrated that human M441-HAP1 interacts with mutant htt more tightly than does human T441-HAP1, reduces soluble htt degraded products and protects against htt-mediated toxicity. We thus provide genetic and functional evidence that the M441-HAP1 polymorphism modifies the AAO of HD.

22612223|t|The G2385R variant of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 associated with Parkinson's disease is a partial loss-of-function mutation.
22612223|t|Autosomal-dominant missense mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) are a common genetic cause of PD (Parkinson's disease). LRRK2 is a multidomain protein with kinase and GTPase activities. Dominant mutations are found in the domains that have these two enzyme activities, including the common G2019S mutation that increases kinase activity 2-3-fold. However, there is also a genetic variant in some populations, G2385R, that lies in a C-terminal WD40 domain of LRRK2 and acts as a risk factor for PD. In the present study we show that the G2385R mutation causes a partial loss of the kinase function of LRRK2 and deletion of the C-terminus completely abolishes kinase activity. This effect is strong enough to overcome the kinase-activating effects of the G2019S mutation in the kinase domain. Hsp90 (heat-shock protein of 90 kDa) has an increased affinity for the G2385R variant compared with WT (wild-type) LRRK2, and inhibition of the chaperone binding combined with proteasome inhibition leads to association of mutant LRRK2 with high molecular mass native fractions that probably represent proteasome degradation pathways. The loss-of-function of G2385R correlates with several cellular phenotypes that have been proposed to be kinase-dependent. These results suggest that the C-terminus of LRRK2 plays an important role in maintaining enzymatic function of the protein and that G2385R may be associated with PD in a way that is different from kinase-activating mutations. These results may be important in understanding the differing mechanism(s) by which mutations in LRRK2 act and may also have implications for therapeutic strategies for PD.

11726501|t|Bub3 interaction with Mad2, Mad3 and Cdc20 is mediated by WD40 repeats and does not require intact kinetochores.
11726501|t|The kinetochore checkpoint pathway, involving the Mad1, Mad2, Mad3, Bub1, Bub3 and Mps1 proteins, prevents anaphase entry and mitotic exit by inhibiting the anaphase promoting complex activator Cdc20 in response to monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle fibres. We show here that Cdc20, which had previously been shown to interact physically with Mad2 and Mad3, associates also with Bub3 and association is up-regulated upon checkpoint activation. Moreover, co-fractionation experiments suggest that Mad2, Mad3 and Bub3 may be concomitantly present in protein complexes with Cdc20. Formation of the Bub3-Cdc20 complex requires all kinetochore checkpoint proteins but, surprisingly, not intact kinetochores. Conversely, point mutations altering the conserved WD40 motifs of Bub3, which might be involved in the formation of a beta-propeller fold devoted to protein-protein interactions, disrupt its association with Mad2, Mad3 and Cdc20, as well as proper checkpoint response. We suggest that Bub3 could serve as a platform for interactions between kinetochore checkpoint proteins, and its association with Mad2, Mad3 and Cdc20 might be instrumental for checkpoint activation.

19103591|t|Analyzing the interaction of RseA and RseB, the two negative regulators of the sigmaE envelope stress response, using a combined bioinformatic and experimental strategy.
19103591|t|The Escherichia coli envelope stress response is controlled by the alternative sigma factor, sigma(E), and is induced when unfolded outer membrane proteins accumulate in the periplasm. The response is initiated by sequential cleavage of the membrane-spanning antisigma factor, RseA. RseB is an important negative regulator of envelope stress response that exerts its negative effects onsigma(E) activity through its binding to RseA. In this study, we analyze the interaction between RseA and RseB. We found that tight binding of RseB to RseA required intact RseB. Using programs that performed global and local sequence alignment of RseB and RseA, we found regions of high similarity and performed alanine substitution mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that these regions were functionally important. This protocol is based on the hypothesis that functionally dependent regions of two proteins co-evolve and therefore are likely to be sequentially conserved. This procedure allowed us to identify both an N-terminal and C-terminal region in RseB important for binding to RseA. We extensively analyzed the C-terminal region, which aligns with a region of RseA coincident with the major RseB binding determinant in RseA. Both allele-specific suppression analysis and cysteine-mediated disulfide bond formation indicated that this C-terminal region of similarity of RseA and RseB identifies a contact site between the two proteins. We suggest a similar protocol can be successfully applied to pairs of non-homologous but functionally linked proteins to find specific regions of the protein sequences that are important for establishing functional linkage.

15350218|t|WNK1 phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 and modulates its membrane binding.
15350218|t|WNK (with no lysine [K]) protein kinases were named for their unique active site organization. Mutations in WNK1 and WNK4 cause a familial form of hypertension by undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that WNK1 selectively binds to and phosphorylates synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) within its calcium binding C2 domains. Endogenous WNK1 and Syt2 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize on a subset of secretory granules in INS-1 cells. Phosphorylation by WNK1 increases the amount of Ca2+ required for Syt2 binding to phospholipid vesicles; mutation of threonine 202, a WNK1 phosphorylation site, partially prevents this change. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Syts by WNK1 can regulate Ca2+ sensing and the subsequent Ca2+-dependent interactions mediated by Syt C2 domains. These findings provide a biochemical mechanism that could lead to the retention or insertion of proteins in the plasma membrane. Interruption of this regulatory pathway may disturb membrane events that regulate ion balance.

25680527|t|Pirin regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition independently of Bcl3-Slug signaling.
25680527|t|UNASSIGNED: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. Proteomic analysis indicates that Pirin is involved in metastasis. However, there are no reports demonstrating its direct contribution. Here we investigated the involvement of Pirin in EMT. In HeLa cells, Pirin suppressed E-cadherin expression and regulated the expression of other EMT markers. Furthermore, cells expressing Pirin exhibited a spindle-like morphology, which is reminiscent of EMT. A Pirin mutant defective for Bcl3 binding decreased E-cadherin expression similar to wild-type, suggesting that Pirin regulates E-cadherin independently of Bcl3-Slug signaling. These data provide direct evidence that Pirin contributes to cancer metastasis.

10512882|t|Complex formation with focal adhesion kinase: A mechanism to regulate activity and subcellular localization of Src kinases.
10512882|t|Tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) creates a high-affinity binding site for the src homology 2 domain of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Assembly of a complex between FAK and Src kinases may serve to regulate the subcellular localization and the enzymatic activity of members of the Src family of kinases. We show that simultaneous overexpression of FAK and pp60(c-src) or p59(fyn) results in the enhancement of the tyrosine phosphorylation of a limited number of cellular substrates, including paxillin. Under these conditions, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is largely cell adhesion dependent. FAK mutants defective for Src binding or focal adhesion targeting fail to cooperate with pp60(c-src) or p59(fyn) to induce paxillin phosphorylation, whereas catalytically defective FAK mutants can direct paxillin phosphorylation. The negative regulatory site of pp60(c-src) is hypophosphorylated when in complex with FAK, and coexpression with FAK leads to a redistribution of pp60(c-src) from a diffuse cellular location to focal adhesions. A FAK mutant defective for Src binding does not effectively induce the translocation of pp60(c-src) to focal adhesions. These results suggest that association with FAK can alter the localization of Src kinases and that FAK functions to direct phosphorylation of cellular substrates by recruitment of Src kinases.

24726729|t|Arginine methylation of the cellular nucleic acid binding protein does not affect its subcellular localization but impedes RNA binding.
24726729|t|Cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) contains seven zinc finger (ZF) repeats and an arginine and glycine (RG) rich sequence between the first and the second ZF. CNBP interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1. Full-length but not RG-deleted or mutated CNBP can be methylated. Treatment with a methylation inhibitor AdOx reduced CNBP methylation, but did not affect the concentrated nuclear localization of CNBP. Nevertheless, arginine methylation of CNBP appeared to interfere with its RNA binding activity. Our findings show that arginine methylation of CNBP in the RG motif did not change the subcellular localization, but regulated its RNA binding activity.

18154663|t|Binding to DPF-motif by the POB1 EH domain is responsible for POB1-Eps15 interaction.
18154663|t|BACKGROUND: Eps15 homology (EH) domains are protein interaction modules binding to peptides containing Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs and mediating critical events during endocytosis and signal transduction. The EH domain of POB1 associates with Eps15, a protein characterized by a striking string of DPF triplets, 15 in human and 13 in mouse Eps15, at the C-terminus and lacking the typical EH-binding NPF motif. RESULTS: By screening a multivalent nonapeptide phage display library we have demonstrated that the EH domain of POB1 has a different recognition specificity since it binds to both NPF and DPF motifs. The region of mouse Eps15 responsible for the interaction with the EH domain of POB1 maps within a 18 amino acid peptide (residues 623-640) that includes three DPF repeats. Finally, mutational analysis in the EH domain of POB1, revealed that several solvent exposed residues, while distal to the binding pocket, mediate specific recognition of binding partners through both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts. CONCLUSION: In the present study we have analysed the binding specificity of the POB1 EH domain. We show that it differs from other EH domains since it interacts with both NPF- and DPF-containing sequences. These unusual binding properties could be attributed to a different conformation of the binding pocket that allows to accommodate negative charges; moreover, we identified a cluster of solvent exposed Lys residues, which are only found in the EH domain of POB1, and influence binding to both NPF and DPF motifs. The characterization of structures of the DPF ligands described in this study and the POB1 EH domain will clearly determine the involvement of the positive patch and the rationalization of our findings.

23856421|t|Congenital disorder of glycosylation due to DPM1 mutations presenting with dystroglycanopathy-type congenital muscular dystrophy.
23856421|t|Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are rare genetic defects mainly in the post-translational modification of proteins via attachment of carbohydrate chains. We describe an infant with the phenotype of a congenital muscular dystrophy, with borderline microcephaly, hypotonia, camptodactyly, severe motor delay, and elevated creatine kinase. Muscle biopsy showed muscular dystrophy and reduced a-dystroglycan immunostaining with glycoepitope-specific antibodies in a pattern diagnostic of dystroglycanopathy. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin testing showed a pattern pointing to a CDG type I. Sanger sequencing of DPM1 (dolichol-P-mannose synthase subunit 1) revealed a novel Gly > Val change c.455G > T missense mutation resulting in p.Gly152Val) of unknown pathogenicity and deletion/duplication analysis revealed an intragenic deletion from exons 3 to 7 on the other allele. DPM1 activity in fibroblasts was reduced by 80%, while affinity for the substrate was not depressed, suggesting a decrease in the amount of active enzyme. Transfected cells expressing tagged versions of wild type and the p.Gly152Val mutant displayed reduced binding to DPM3, an essential, non-catalytic subunit of the DPM complex, suggesting a mechanism for pathogenicity. The present case is the first individual described with DPM1-CDG (CDG-Ie) to also have clinical and muscle biopsy findings consistent with dystroglycanopathy.

18046459|t|Structure and functional analysis of the IGF-II/IGF2R interaction.
18046459|t|Embryonic development and normal growth require exquisite control of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In mammals the extracellular region of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor has gained an IGF-II-binding function and is termed type II IGF receptor (IGF2R). IGF2R sequesters IGF-II; imbalances occur in cancers and IGF2R is implicated in tumour suppression. We report crystal structures of IGF2R domains 11-12, 11-12-13-14 and domains 11-12-13/IGF-II complex. A distinctive juxtaposition of these domains provides the IGF-II-binding unit, with domain 11 directly interacting with IGF-II and domain 13 modulating binding site flexibility. Our complex shows that Phe19 and Leu53 of IGF-II lock into a hydrophobic pocket unique to domain 11 of mammalian IGF2Rs. Mutagenesis analyses confirm this IGF-II 'binding-hotspot', revealing that IGF-binding proteins and IGF2R have converged on the same high-affinity site.

12646039|t|Interactions between plant RING-H2 and plant-specific NAC (NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2) proteins: RING-H2 molecular specificity and cellular localization.
12646039|t|Numerous, highly conserved RING-H2 domains are found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress). To characterize potential RING-H2 protein interactions, the small RING-H2 protein RHA2a was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. RHA2a interacted with one of the plant-specific NAC [NAM ('no apical meristem'), ATAF1/2, CUC2 ('cup-shaped cotyledons 2')] transcription factors, here named ANAC (abscisic acid-responsive NAC). The core RING-H2 domain was sufficient for the interaction. The ability of 11 structurally diverse RING-H2 domains to interact with ANAC was then examined. Robust interaction was detected for three of the domains, suggesting multi-specificity for the interaction. The domains that interacted with ANAC contain a glutamic acid residue in a position corresponding to a proline in many RING-H2 domains. Conversion of this glutamic acid residue into proline in RHA2a decreased its ability to interact with ANAC, most likely by changing the interaction surface. This suggested that a short, divergent region in RING-H2 domains modulate interaction specificity. ANAC contains a degenerate bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), while RHG1a, also identified as an ANAC interaction partner, contains a basic NLS. Both signals localized beta-glucuronidase reporter fusions to the nucleus. N-terminally truncated RHA2a also directed nuclear localization, apparently dependent on basic amino acids in the RING-H2 domain. Nuclear co-localization of the RING-H2 proteins and ANAC may enable their interaction in vivo to regulate the activity of the ANAC transcription factor.

10656681|t|Self-association of the SET domains of human ALL-1 and of Drosophila TRITHORAX and ASH1 proteins.
10656681|t|The human ALL-1 gene is involved in acute leukemia through gene fusions, partial tandem duplications or a specific deletion. Several sequence motifs within the ALL-1 protein, such as the SET domain, PHD fingers and the region with homology to DNA methyl transferase are shared with other proteins involved in transcription regulation through chromatin alterations. However, the function of these motifs is still not clear. Studying ALL-1 presents an additional challenge because the gene is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax. The latter is a member of the trithorax-Polycomb gene family which acts to determine the body pattern of Drosophila by maintaining expression or repression of the Antennapedia-bithorax homeotic gene complex. Here we apply yeast two hybrid methodology, in vivo immunoprecipitation and in vitro 'pull down' techniques to show self association of the SET motifs of ALL-1, TRITHORAX and ASH1 proteins (Drosophila ASH1 is encoded by a trithorax-group gene). Point mutations in evolutionary conserved residues of TRITHORAX SET, abolish the interaction. SET-SET interactions might act in integrating the activity of ALL-1 (TRX and ASH1) protein molecules, simultaneously positioned at different maintenance elements and directing expression of the same or different target genes.

17446860|t|Dual mechanisms specify Doa4-mediated deubiquitination at multivesicular bodies.
17446860|t|Doa4 is a ubiquitin-specific protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that deubiquitinates integral membrane proteins sorted into the lumenal vesicles of late-endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We show that the non-catalytic N terminus of Doa4 mediates its recruitment to endosomes through its association with Bro1, which is one of several highly conserved class E Vps proteins that comprise the core MVB sorting machinery. In turn, Bro1 directly stimulates deubiquitination by interacting with a YPxL motif in the catalytic domain of Doa4. Mutations in either Doa4 or Bro1 that disrupt catalytic activation of Doa4 impair deubiquitination and sorting of MVB cargo proteins and lead to the formation of lumenal MVB vesicles that are predominantly small compared with the vesicles seen in wild-type cells. Thus, by recruiting Doa4 to late endosomes and stimulating its catalytic activity, Bro1 fulfills a novel dual role in coordinating deubiquitination in the MVB pathway.

12649160|t|Fanconi anemia protein complex: mapping protein interactions in the yeast 2- and 3-hybrid systems.
12649160|t|Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. Eight FA complementation groups have been identified. The FANCA, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG proteins form a nuclear complex required for the monoubiquination of the FANCD2 protein. To investigate the architecture of the FA protein complex, the yeast 2-hybrid system was used to map contact points of the FANCA/FANCG, FANCC/FANCE, and FANCF/FANCG interactions. FANCG was shown to interact with both the amino-terminus of FANCA and the carboxyl-terminal region of FANCF. A FANCG mutant truncated at the carboxyl-terminus retained the ability to interact with FANCA. The interaction between FANCG and FANCF was ablated by a Leu71Pro mutant of FANCG. A central region of FANCE was sufficient for FANCC binding. A Leu554Pro mutant of FANCC failed to interact with FANCE. To further examine complex assembly, the yeast 3-hybrid system was used to investigate the ability of FANCG to act as a molecular bridge in mediating interaction between other FA proteins. FANCG was able to mediate interaction between FANCA and FANCF, as well as between monomers of FANCA. Direct interaction between FANCE and FANCD2 was also demonstrated in the yeast 2-hybrid system. This interaction involving an amino-terminal region of FANCD2 may provide a link between the FA protein complex and its downstream targets.

22334672|t|Herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein directly interacts with the nuclear pore complex through Nup62, inhibiting host nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways.
22334672|t|The herpes simplex virus ICP27 protein is important for the expression and nuclear export of viral mRNAs. Although several binding sites have been mapped along the ICP27 sequence for various RNA and protein partners, including the transport receptor TAP of the host cell nuclear transport machinery, several aspects of ICP27 trafficking through the nuclear pore complex remain unclear. We investigated if ICP27 could interact directly with the nuclear pore complex itself, finding that ICP27 directly binds the core nucleoporin Nup62. This is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays with purified components. Mapping with ICP27 deletion and point mutants further shows that the interaction requires sequences in both the N and C termini of ICP27. Expression of wild type ICP27 protein inhibited both classical, importin a/b-dependent and transportin-dependent nuclear import. In contrast, an ICP27 point mutant that does not interact with Nup62 had no such inhibitory effect. We suggest that ICP27 association with Nup62 provides additional binding sites at the nuclear pore for ICP27 shuttling, thus supporting ICP27-mediated transport. We propose that ICP27 competes with some host cell transport receptors for binding, resulting in inhibition of those host transport pathways.

17237231|t|The class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that is implicated in atherogenesis, innate immunity, and cell adhesion. Despite extensive structure-function studies of the receptor, intracellular molecules that directly interact with SR-A and regulate the receptor trafficking have not been determined. In the current study, we have identified a microtubule-binding protein, Hook3, as a novel interacting partner of SR-A. The association between a rat Hook3 isoform and SR-A was suggested by yeast two-hybrid screening and mass spectrometry analysis of SR-A-cytoplasmic domain-bound proteins in rat alveolar macrophages. The binding of overexpressed and endogenous human Hook3 to SR-A was demonstrated by pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitations. Furthermore, endogenous murine SR-A and HK3 co-sedimented from cell lysates isolated from Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells. The interaction of Hook3 with SR-A was significantly stimulated after SR-A had recognized the extracellular ligand. Studies using truncations demonstrated that the positively charged C-terminal Val614-Ala717 region of human Hook3 was required for the interaction with the negatively charged residues, Glu12, Asp13, and Asp15 in the human SR-A cytoplasmic domain. By transfecting small interfering RNA targeting Hook3, total and surface expression, receptor-mediated ligand uptake and protein stability of SR-A were significantly promoted, whereas the protein synthesis and maturation were not altered. We propose for the first time that Hook3 may participate in the turnover of the endocytosed scavenger receptor.

21896487|t|The large extracellular loop of organic cation transporter 1 influences substrate affinity and is pivotal for oligomerization.
21896487|t|Polyspecific organic anion transporters (OATs) and organic cation transporters (OCTs) of the SLC22 transporter family play a pivotal role in absorption, distribution, and excretion of drugs. Polymorphisms in these transporters influence therapeutic effects. On the basis of functional characterizations, homology modeling, and mutagenesis, hypotheses for how OCTs bind and translocate structurally different cations were raised, assuming functionally competent monomers. However, homo-oligomerization has been described for OATs and OCTs. In the present study, evidence is provided that the large extracellular loops (EL) of rat Oct1 (rOct1) and rat Oat1 (rOat1) mediate homo- but not hetero-oligomerization. Replacement of the cysteine residues in the EL of rOct1 by serine residues (rOct1(6/\C-l)) or breaking disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol prevented oligomerization. rOct1 chimera containing the EL of rOat1 (rOct1(rOat1-l)) showed oligomerization but reduced transporter amount in the plasma membrane. For rOct1(6/\C-l) and rOct1(rOat1-l), similar K(m) values for 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium(+) (MPP(+)) and tetraethylammonium(+) (TEA(+)) were obtained that were higher compared with rOct1 wild type. The increased K(m) of rOct1(rOat1-l) indicates an allosteric effect of EL on the cation binding region. The similar substrate affinity of the oligomerizing and non-oligomerizing loop mutants suggests that oligomerization does not influence transport function. Independent transport function of rOct1 monomers was also demonstrated by showing that K(m) values for MPP(+) and TEA(+) were not changed after treatment with dithiothreitol and that a tandem protein with two rOct1 monomers showed about 50% activity with unchanged K(m) values for MPP(+) and TEA(+) when one monomer was blocked. The data help to understand how OCTs work and how mutations in patients may affect their functions.

17350623|t|PKCzetaII is a target for degradation through the tumour suppressor protein pVHL.
17350623|t|PKCzetaII is a rapidly degraded variant of PKCzeta that suppresses epithelial cell polarisation. It is shown here that PKCzetaII is a target for the E3 ligase and tumour suppressor Von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Deletion studies demonstrate that the C-terminal region is required for the pVHL and proteasome dependent turnover of PKCzetaII, however it is the N-terminal PB1 domain of PKCzetaII that is required for pVHL complex formation. Reciprocal deletion studies define the pVHL effector domain as the dominant PKCzetaII binding site. The results indicate that pVHL recruits PKCzetaII via its PB1 domain and causes ubiquitination and degradation via the distal C-terminus of PKCzetaII.

16098514|t|Analysis of mTOR signaling by the small G-proteins, Rheb and RhebL1.
16098514|t|The small G protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain) is known to promote mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In this study, we show that Rheb like-1 protein (RhebL1) rescues mTOR signaling during nutrient withdrawal and that tuberous sclerosis complex-1 (TSC) and TSC2 impairs RhebL1-mediated signaling through mTOR. We identify critical residues within the switch I region (N41) and 'constitutive' effector (Ec) region (Y/F54 and L56) of Rheb and RhebL1, which are required for their efficient activation of mTOR signaling. Mutation of Rheb and RhebL1 at N41 impaired their interaction with mTOR, which identifies mTOR as a common downstream target of both Rheb and RhebL1.

18309291|t|Spindle assembly checkpoint gene mdf-1 regulates germ cell proliferation in response to nutrition signals in C. elegans.
18309291|t|When newly hatched Caenorhabditis elegans larvae are starved, their primordial germ cells (PGCs) arrest in the post-S phase. This starvation-induced PGC arrest is mediated by the DAF-18/PTEN-AKT-1/PKB nutrient-sensing pathway. Here, we report that the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) component MDF-1/MAD1 is required for the PGC arrest. We identified 2 Akt kinase phosphorylation sites on MDF-1. Expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant MDF-1 partially suppressed the defect in the starvation-induced PGC arrest in L1 larvae lacking DAF-18, suggesting that MDF-1 regulates germ cell proliferation as a downstream target of AKT-1, thereby demonstrating a functional link between cell-cycle regulation by the SAC components and nutrient sensing by DAF-18-AKT-1 during post-embryonic development. The phosphorylation status of MDF-1 affects its binding to another SAC component, MDF-2/MAD2. The loss of MDF-2 or another SAC component also caused inappropriate germ cell proliferation, but the defect was less severe than that caused by mdf-1 hemizygosity, suggesting that MDF-1 causes the PGC arrest by two mechanisms, one involving MDF-2 and another that is independent of other SAC components.

16873060|t|A CK2-dependent mechanism for degradation of the PML tumor suppressor.
16873060|t|The PML tumor suppressor controls key pathways for growth suppression, induction of apoptosis, and cellular senescence. PML loss occurs frequently in human tumors through unknown posttranslational mechanisms. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is oncogenic and frequently upregulated in human tumors. Here we show that CK2 regulates PML protein levels by promoting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation dependent on direct phosphorylation at Ser517. Consequently, PML mutants that are resistant to CK2 phosphorylation display increased tumor-suppressive functions. In a faithful mouse model of lung cancer, we demonstrate that Pml inactivation leads to increased tumorigenesis. Furthermore, CK2 pharmacological inhibition enhances the PML tumor-suppressive property in vivo. Importantly, we found an inverse correlation between CK2 kinase activity and PML protein levels in human lung cancer-derived cell lines and primary specimens. These data identify a key posttranslational mechanism that controls PML protein levels and provide therapeutic means toward PML restoration through CK2 inhibition.

22892567|t|Cacnb4 directly couples electrical activity to gene expression, a process defective in juvenile epilepsy.
22892567|t|Calcium current through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) controls gene expression. Here, we describe a novel signalling pathway in which the VGCC Cacnb4 subunit directly couples neuronal excitability to transcription. Electrical activity induces Cacnb4 association to Ppp2r5d, a regulatory subunit of PP2A phosphatase, followed by (i) nuclear translocation of Cacnb4/Ppp2r5d/PP2A, (ii) association with the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene promoter through the nuclear transcription factor thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRa), and (iii) histone binding through association of Cacnb4 with HP1y concomitantly with Ser(10) histone H3 dephosphorylation by PP2A. This signalling cascade leads to TH gene repression by Cacnb4 and is controlled by the state of interaction between the SH3 and guanylate kinase (GK) modules of Cacnb4. The human R482X CACNB4 mutation, responsible for a form of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, prevents association with Ppp2r5 and nuclear targeting of the complex by altering Cacnb4 conformation. These findings demonstrate that an intact VGCC subunit acts as a repressor recruiting platform to control neuronal gene expression.

15131699|t|Bcl-x(L) sequesters its C-terminal membrane anchor in soluble, cytosolic homodimers.
15131699|t|Bcl-x(L) is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. While Bcl-x(L) can be bound to mitochondria, a substantial fraction, depending on the cell type or tissue, is found in the cytosol of healthy cells. Gel filtration and crosslinking experiments reveal that, unlike monomeric Bax, Bcl-x(L) migrates in a complex of approximately 50 kDa in the cytosol. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Bcl-x(L) in the cytosol forms homodimers. The C-terminal hydrophobic tails of two Bcl-x(L) molecules are involved in homodimer formation, and analysis of mutants demonstrates that the C-terminal lysine residue and the G138 residue lining the BH3-binding pocket are required for homodimerization. The flexible loop preceding the C-terminal tail in Bcl-x(L) is longer than that of several monomeric Bcl-2 family members and is a requisite for the homodimer formation. Bad binding to Bcl-x(L) dissociates the homodimers and triggers Bcl-x(L) binding to mitochondrial membranes. The C-terminal tail of Bcl-x(L) is also required to mediate Bcl-x(L)/Bax heterodimer formation. Both mitochondrial import and antiapoptotic activity of different Bcl-x(L) mutants correlate with their ability to form homodimers.

8114715|t|Lck-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP1 in murine T cells.
8114715|t|The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins on tyrosyl residues are key regulatory mechanisms in T-cell signal transduction and are controlled by the opposing activities of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphotyrosyl phosphatases (PTPs). In T cells, several nontransmembrane protein tyrosine kinases are associated with receptors; for example, Lck is bound to the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 and becomes activated upon their stimulation. In comparison, little is known about the role of nontransmembrane PTPs in early T-cell signaling. SH-PTP1 (PTP1C, HCP, SHP) is a nontransmembrane PTP expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, including T cells. We have found that SH-PTP1 is basally phosphorylated on serine in resting T cells. Upon stimulation of CD4 or CD8 either in a T-cell hybridoma cell line or in primary thymocytes, SH-PTP1 becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated. Moreover, SH-PTP1 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in the Lck-overexpressing lymphoma cell line LSTRA. SH-PTP1 is also a good substrate for recombinant Lck in vitro. Comparisons of the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of wild-type SH-PTP1 and deletion and point mutations establish that the two sites (Y-536 and Y-564) which are directly phosphorylated by Lck in vitro are also phosphorylated in vivo in LSTRA cells. One of these sites (Y-564) is phosphorylated in T cells in response to Lck activation. We conclude that SH-PTP1 undergoes Lck-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation in T cells and likely plays a role in early T-cell signaling.

26752685|t|FIH Regulates Cellular Metabolism through Hydroxylation of the Deubiquitinase OTUB1.
26752685|t|The asparagine hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), confers oxygen-dependence upon the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. Studies investigating whether asparagine hydroxylation is a general regulatory oxygen-dependent modification have identified multiple non-HIF targets for FIH. However, the functional consequences of this outside of the HIF pathway remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase ovarian tumor domain containing ubiquitin aldehyde binding protein 1 (OTUB1) is a substrate for hydroxylation by FIH on N22. Mutation of N22 leads to a profound change in the interaction of OTUB1 with proteins important in cellular metabolism. Furthermore, in cultured cells, overexpression of N22A mutant OTUB1 impairs cellular metabolic processes when compared to wild type. Based on these data, we hypothesize that OTUB1 is a target for functional hydroxylation by FIH. Additionally, we propose that our results provide new insight into the regulation of cellular energy metabolism during hypoxic stress and the potential for targeting hydroxylases for therapeutic benefit.

19236849|t|Carboxy-terminal phosphorylation of SIRT1 by protein kinase CK2.
19236849|t|Previous analyses of the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases and its most prominent member SIRT1 have focused primarily on the identification of cellular targets exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of its implicated function in the control of metabolic homeostasis, differentiation, apoptosis and cell survival. So far, little is known about the regulation of SIRT1 itself. In the study presented herein, we assigned the main region of SIRT1 in vivo phosphorylation to amino acids 643-691 of the unique carboxy-terminal domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1 is a substrate for protein kinase CK2 both in vitro and in vivo. Both, deletion construct analyses and serine-to-alanine mutations identified SIRT1 Ser-659 and Ser-661 as major CK2 phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated in vivo as well.

21073465|t|Insight into the mode of action of the LRRK2 Y1699C pathogenic mutant.
21073465|t|Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most prevalent known cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. The LRRK2 gene encodes a Roco protein featuring a Ras of complex proteins (ROC) GTPase and a kinase domain linked by the C-terminal of ROC (COR) domain. Here, we explored the effects of the Y1699C pathogenic LRRK2 mutation in the COR domain on GTPase activity and interactions within the catalytic core of LRRK2. We observed a decrease in GTPase activity for LRRK2 Y1699C comparable to the decrease observed for the R1441C pathogenic mutant and the T1348N dysfunctional mutant. To study the underlying mechanism, we explored the dimerization in the catalytic core of LRRK2. ROC-COR dimerization was significantly weakened by the Y1699C or R1441C/G mutation. Using a competition assay, we demonstrated that the intra-molecular ROC : COR interaction is favoured over ROC : ROC dimerization. Interestingly, the intra-molecular ROC : COR interaction was strengthened by the Y1699C mutation. This is supported by a 3D homology model of the ROC-COR tandem of LRRK2, showing that Y1699 is positioned at the intra-molecular ROC : COR interface. In conclusion, our data provides mechanistic insight into the mode of action of the Y1699C LRRK2 mutant: the Y1699C substitution, situated at the intra-molecular ROC : COR interface, strengthens the intra-molecular ROC : COR interaction, thereby locally weakening the dimerization of LRRK2 at the ROC-COR tandem domain resulting in decreased GTPase activity.

18976727|t|A homozygous mutation in human PRICKLE1 causes an autosomal-recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy-ataxia syndrome.
18976727|t|Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a syndrome characterized by myoclonic seizures (lightning-like jerks), generalized convulsive seizures, and varying degrees of neurological decline, especially ataxia and dementia. Previously, we characterized three pedigrees of individuals with PME and ataxia, where either clinical features or linkage mapping excluded known PME loci. This report identifies a mutation in PRICKLE1 (also known as RILP for REST/NRSF interacting LIM domain protein) in all three of these pedigrees. The identified PRICKLE1 mutation blocks the PRICKLE1 and REST interaction in vitro and disrupts the normal function of PRICKLE1 in an in vivo zebrafish overexpression system. PRICKLE1 is expressed in brain regions implicated in epilepsy and ataxia in mice and humans, and, to our knowledge, is the first molecule in the noncanonical WNT signaling pathway to be directly implicated in human epilepsy.

10318831|t|A PDZ protein regulates the distribution of the transmembrane semaphorin, M-SemF.
10318831|t|M-SemF is a membrane-associated, neurally enriched member of the semaphorin family of axon guidance signals. We considered whether the cytoplasmic domain of M-SemF might possess a signaling function and/or might control the distribution of M-SemF on the cell surface. We identify a PDZ-containing neural protein as an M-SemF cytoplasmic domain-associated protein (SEMCAP-1). SEMCAP-2 is a closely related nonneuronal protein. SEMCAP-1 has recently also been identified as GIPC, by virtue of its interaction with the RGS protein GAIP in vitro (De Vries, L., Lou, X., Zhao, G., Zheng, B., and Farquhar, M. G. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 12340-12345). Expression studies support the notion that SEMCAP-1(GIPC) interacts with M-SemF, but not GAIP, in brain. Lung SEMCAP-2 and SEMCAP-1(GIPC) are potential partners for both GAIP and M-SemF. The protein interaction requires the single PDZ domain of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) and the carboxyl-terminal four residues of M-SemF, ESSV. While SEMCAP-1(GIPC) also interacts with SemC, it does not interact with other proteins containing a class I PDZ binding motif, nor does M-SemF interact with other class I PDZ proteins. Co-expression of SEMCAP-1(GIPC) induces the redistribution of dispersed M-SemF into detergent-resistant aggregates in HEK293 cells. Thus, SEMCAP-1(GIPC) appears to regulate the subcellular distribution of M-SemF in brain, and SEMCAPs could link M-SemF to G protein signal transduction pathways.

10982829|t|The coiled-coil domain of Stat3 is essential for its SH2 domain-mediated receptor binding and subsequent activation induced by epidermal growth factor and interleukin-6.
10982829|t|STAT proteins are a family of latent transcription factors that mediate the response to various cytokines and growth factors. Upon stimulation by cytokines, STAT proteins are recruited to the receptors via their SH2 domains, phosphorylated on a specific tyrosine, dimerized, and translocated into the nucleus, where they bind specific DNA sequences and activate the target gene transcription. STATs share highly conserved structures, including an N-domain, a coiled-coil domain, a DNA-binding domain, a linker domain, and an SH2 domain. To investigate the role of the coiled-coil domain, we performed a systematic deletion analysis of the N-domain and each of the alpha-helices and mutagenesis of conserved residues in the coiled-coil region of Stat3. Our results indicate that the coiled-coil domain is essential for Stat3 recruitment to the receptor and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activities, such as dimer formation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding, stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or interleukin-6 (IL-6). Single mutation of Asp170 or, to a lesser extent, Lys177 in alpha-helix 1 diminishes both receptor binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the Asp170 mutant retains its ability to bind to DNA when phosphorylated on Tyr705 by Src kinase in vitro, implying a functional SH2 domain. Finally, we demonstrate a direct binding of Stat3 to the receptor. Taken together, our data reveal a novel role for the coiled-coil domain that regulates the early events in Stat3 activation and function.

15983381|t|Interaction of DJ-1 with Daxx inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activity and cell death.
15983381|t|Investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of genes that cause inherited forms of Parkinson's disease, as well as the downstream pathways that they trigger, shed considerable light on our understanding the fundamental determinants of life and death in dopaminergic neurons. Homozygous deletion or missense mutation in DJ-1 results in autosomal recessively inherited Parkinson's disease, suggesting that wild-type DJ-1 has a favorable role in maintaining these neurons. Here, we show that DJ-1 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death, but that its relatively modest ability to quench reactive oxygen species is insufficient to account for its more robust cytoprotective effect. To elucidate the mechanism of this cell-preserving function, we have screened out the death protein Daxx as a DJ-1-interacting partner. We demonstrate that wild-type DJ-1 sequesters Daxx in the nucleus, prevents it from gaining access to the cytoplasm, from binding to and activating its effector kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and therefore, from triggering the ensuing death pathway. All these steps are impaired by the disease-causing L166P mutant isoform of DJ-1. These findings suggest that the regulated sequestration of Daxx in the nucleus and keeping apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activation in check is a critical mechanism by which DJ-1 exerts its cytoprotective function.

18768751|t|An alpha-helical extension of the ELMO1 pleckstrin homology domain mediates direct interaction to DOCK180 and is critical in Rac signaling.
18768751|t|The mammalian DOCK180 protein belongs to an evolutionarily conserved protein family, which together with ELMO proteins, is essential for activation of Rac GTPase-dependent biological processes. Here, we have analyzed the DOCK180-ELMO1 interaction, and map direct interaction interfaces to the N-terminal 200 amino acids of DOCK180, and to the C-terminal 200 amino acids of ELMO1, comprising the ELMO1 PH domain. Structural and biochemical analysis of this PH domain reveals that it is incapable of phospholipid binding, but instead structurally resembles FERM domains. Moreover, the structure revealed an N-terminal amphiphatic alpha-helix, and point mutants of invariant hydrophobic residues in this helix disrupt ELMO1-DOCK180 complex formation. A secondary interaction between ELMO1 and DOCK180 is conferred by the DOCK180 SH3 domain and proline-rich motifs at the ELMO1 C-terminus. Mutation of both DOCK180-interaction sites on ELMO1 is required to disrupt the DOCK180-ELMO1 complex. Significantly, although this does not affect DOCK180 GEF activity toward Rac in vivo, Rac signaling is impaired, implying additional roles for ELMO in mediating intracellular Rac signaling.

10835346|t|Human dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase consists of three subunits, DPM1, DPM2 and DPM3.
10835346|t|Dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase generates mannosyl donors for glycosylphosphatidylinositols, N-glycan and protein O- and C-mannosylation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this enzyme is encoded by DPM1. We reported previously that mammalian DPM synthase contains catalytic DPM1 and regulatory DPM2 subunits, and that DPM1 requires DPM2 for its stable expression in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report that human DPM synthase consists of three subunits. The third subunit, DPM3, comprises 92 amino acids associated with DPM1 via its C-terminal domain and with DPM2 via its N-terminal portion. The stability of DPM3 was dependent upon DPM2. However, overexpression of DPM3 in Lec15 cells, a null mutant of DPM2, restored the biosynthesis of DPM with an increase in DPM1, indicating that DPM3 directly stabilized DPM1. Therefore, DPM2 stabilizes DPM3 and DPM3 stabilizes DPM1. DPM synthase activity was 10 times higher in the presence of DPM2, indicating that DPM2 also plays a role in the enzymatic reaction. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has proteins that resemble three human subunits; S.pombe DPM3 restored biosynthesis of DPM in Lec15 cells, indicating its orthologous relationship to human DPM3.

9024666|t|Interaction between the C. elegans cell-death regulators CED-9 and CED-4.
9024666|t|Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is an evolutionarily conserved process used by multicellular organisms to eliminate cells that are not needed or are potentially detrimental to the organism. Members of the Bcl-2 family of mammalian proteins are intimately involved in the regulation of apoptosis, but, their precise mechanism of action remains unresolved. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Bcl-2 homologue CED-9 prevents cell death by antagonizing the death-promoting activities of CED-3, a member of the Caspase family of death proteases, and of CED-4, a protein with no known mammalian homologue. Here we show that CED-9 interacts physically with CED-4. Mutations that reduce or eliminate CED-9 activity also disrupt its ability to bind CED-4, suggesting that this interaction is important for CED-9 function. Thus, CED-9 might control C. elegans cell death by binding to and regulating CED-4 activity. We propose that mammalian Bcl-2 family members might control apoptosis in a similar way through interaction and regulation of CED-4 homologues or analogues.

20124439|t|Chylomicronemia with low postheparin lipoprotein lipase levels in the setting of GPIHBP1 defects.
20124439|t|BACKGROUND: Recent studies in mice have established that an endothelial cell protein, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), is essential for the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the discovery of a homozygous missense mutation in GPIHBP1 in a young boy with severe chylomicronemia. The mutation, p.C65Y, replaces a conserved cysteine in the GPIHBP1 lymphocyte antigen 6 domain with a tyrosine and is predicted to perturb protein structure by interfering with the formation of a disulfide bond. Studies with transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that GPIHBP1-C65Y reaches the cell surface but has lost the ability to bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL). When the GPIHBP1-C65Y homozygote was given an intravenous bolus of heparin, only trace amounts of LPL entered the plasma. We also observed very low levels of LPL in the postheparin plasma of a subject with chylomicronemia who was homozygous for a different GPIHBP1 mutation (p.Q115P). When the GPIHBP1-Q115P homozygote was given a 6-hour infusion of heparin, a significant amount of LPL appeared in the plasma, resulting in a fall in the plasma triglyceride levels from 1780 to 120 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel GPIHBP1 missense mutation (p.C65Y) associated with defective LPL binding in a young boy with severe chylomicronemia. We also show that homozygosity for the C65Y or Q115P mutations is associated with low levels of LPL in the postheparin plasma, demonstrating that GPIHBP1 is important for plasma triglyceride metabolism in humans.

18307994|t|Enhanced binding of TBK1 by an optineurin mutant that causes a familial form of primary open angle glaucoma.
18307994|t|TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was identified as a binding partner for Optineurin (OPTN) in two-hybrid screens, an interaction confirmed by overexpression/immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells and by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous OPTN and TBK1 from cell extracts. A TBK1 binding site was located between residues 1-127 of OPTN, residues 78-121 displaying striking homology to the TBK1-binding domain of TANK. The OPTN-binding domain was localised to residues 601-729 of TBK1, while TBK1[1-688] which cannot bind to TANK, did not interact with OPTN. The OPTN[E50K] mutant associated with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) displayed strikingly enhanced binding to TBK1, suggesting that this interaction may contribute to familial POAG caused by this mutation.

17314099|t|NM23-H1 tumor suppressor physically interacts with serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor-interacting protein, and negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling.
17314099|t|NM23-H1 is a member of the NM23/NDP kinase gene family and a putative metastasis suppressor. Previously, a screen for NM23-H1-interacting proteins that could potentially modulate its activity identified serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), a transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor-interacting protein. Through the use of cysteine to serine amino acid substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and STRAP (C152S, C270S, and C152S/C270S), we demonstrated that the association between these two proteins is dependent on Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(152) and Cys(270) of STRAP but did not appear to involve Cys(4) and Cys(109) of NM23-H1, suggesting that a disulfide linkage involving Cys(145) of NM23-H1 and Cys(152) or Cys(270) of STRAP mediates complex formation. The interaction was dependent on the presence of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol but not H(2)O(2). Ectopic expression of wild-type NM23-H1, but not NM23-H1(C145S), negatively regulated TGF-beta signaling in a dose-dependent manner, enhanced stable association between the TGF-beta receptor and Smad7, and prevented nuclear translocation of Smad3. Similarly, wild-type NM23-H1 inhibited TGF-beta-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition, whereas NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect. Knockdown of NM23-H1 by small interfering RNA stimulated TGF-beta signaling. Coexpression of wild-type STRAP, but not STRAP(C152S/C270S), significantly stimulated NM23-H1-induced growth of HaCaT cells. These results suggest that the direct interaction of NM23-H1 and STRAP is important for the regulation of TGF-beta-dependent biological activity as well as NM23-H1 activity.

23870315|t|Mutual antagonism between the Ebola virus VP35 protein and the RIG-I activator PACT determines infection outcome.
23870315|t|The cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I is activated by viral RNA and induces type I IFN responses to control viral replication. The cellular dsRNA binding protein PACT can also activate RIG-I. To counteract innate antiviral responses, some viruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV), encode proteins that antagonize RIG-I signaling. Here, we show that EBOV VP35 inhibits PACT-induced RIG-I ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The interaction of PACT with RIG-I is disrupted by wild-type VP35, but not by VP35 mutants that are unable to bind PACT. In addition, PACT-VP35 interaction impairs the association between VP35 and the viral polymerase, thereby diminishing viral RNA synthesis and modulating EBOV replication. PACT-deficient cells are defective in IFN induction and are insensitive to VP35 function. These data support a model in which the VP35-PACT interaction is mutually antagonistic and plays a fundamental role in determining the outcome of EBOV infection.

14551211|t|Separation-of-function mutants of yeast Ku80 reveal a Yku80p-Sir4p interaction involved in telomeric silencing.
14551211|t|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku heterodimer comprising Yku70p and Yku80p is involved in telomere maintenance and DNA repair by the pathway of non-homologous end joining. It is also a key regulator of transcriptional silencing of genes placed in close proximity to telomeres. Here, we describe the identification of separation-of-function mutants of Yku80p that exhibit defects in silencing but not DNA repair and show that these mutations map to an evolutionarily conserved domain within Yku80p. Furthermore, we reveal that Yku80p interacts with the silent information regulator protein Sir4p and that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal 200 amino acid residues of Sir4p. Notably, this interaction also requires the region of Yku80p that contains the sites of the silencing defective mutations. Finally, we show that these mutations impair the Yku80p-Sir4p interaction and recruitment of Sir3p to telomeric regions in vivo. Taken together with other data, these findings indicate that the Yku80p-Sir4p interaction plays a vital role in the assembly of telomeric heterochromatin.

7541045|t|Non-SH2 domains within insulin receptor substrate-1 and SHC mediate their phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction with the NPEY motif of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor.
7541045|t|Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and SHC become rapidly phosphorylated upon tyrosines after insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR) activation. In this study we demonstrate that IRS-1, SHC, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interact directly and specifically with the IGFIR. The interaction of all three proteins is dependent upon IGFIR kinase activity and, furthermore, substitution of Tyr-950 with Phe within the NPEY motif of the IGFIR eliminated interaction with both SHC and IRS-1 but had no effect upon p85 interaction. We show that residues 160-516 of IRS-1 and 1-238 of SHC are sufficient and necessary for receptor interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We also demonstrate a direct in vitro interaction between the IGFIR and a fusion protein containing SHC amino acids 1-238. No interaction was observed with a SHC protein containing only the SH2 domain. We conclude that SHC and IRS-1 interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY motif of the IGFIR, and that both proteins interact via related motifs located in their amino termini. We conclude that the interactions of SHC and IRS-1 with the IGFIR are similar to those which we have previously defined with the insulin receptor.

16478480|t|Inhibition of human ether    go-go potassium channels by Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the cytosolic N- and C-termini.
16478480|t|Human ether    go-go potassium channels (hEAG1) open in response to membrane depolarization and they are inhibited by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), presumably binding to the C-terminal domain of the channel subunits. Deletion of the cytosolic N-terminal domain resulted in complete abolition of Ca2+/CaM sensitivity suggesting the existence of further CaM binding sites. A peptide array-based screen of the entire cytosolic protein of hEAG1 identified three putative CaM-binding domains, two in the C-terminus (BD-C1: 674-683, BD-C2: 711-721) and one in the N-terminus (BD-N: 151-165). Binding of GST-fusion proteins to Ca2+/CaM was assayed with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and precipitation assays. In the presence of Ca2+, BD-N and BD-C2 provided dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, BD-C1 bound with lower affinity. Mutations in the binding domains reduced inhibition of the functional channels by Ca2+/CaM. Employment of CaM-EF-hand mutants showed that CaM binding to the N- and C-terminus are primarily dependent on EF-hand motifs 3 and 4. Hence, closure of EAG channels presumably requires the binding of multiple CaM molecules in a manner more complex than previously assumed.

11134024|t|A novel adapter protein employs a phosphotyrosine binding domain and exceptionally basic N-terminal domains to capture and localize an atypical protein kinase C: characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans C kinase adapter 1, a protein that avidly binds protein kinase C3.
11134024|t|Atypical protein kinase C isoforms (aPKCs) transmit regulatory signals to effector proteins located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, cytoskeleton, and membranes. Mechanisms by which aPKCs encounter and control effector proteins in various microenvironments are poorly understood. By using a protein interaction screen, we discovered two novel proteins that adapt a Caenorhabditis elegans aPKC (PKC3) for specialized (localized) functions; protein kinase C adapter 1 (CKA1, 593 amino acids) and CKA1S (549 amino acids) are derived from a unique mRNA by alternative utilization of two translation initiation codons. CKA1S and CKA1 are routed to the cell periphery by exceptionally basic N-terminal regions that include classical phosphorylation site domains (PSDs). Tethering of PKC3 is mediated by a segment of CKA1 that constitutes a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Two aromatic amino acids (Phe(175) and Phe(221)) are indispensable for creation of a PKC3-binding surface and/or stabilization of CKA1.aPKC complexes. Patterns of CKA1 gene promoter activity and CKA1/CKA1S protein localization in vivo overlap with patterns established for PKC3 expression and distribution. Transfection experiments demonstrated that CKA1/CKA1S sequesters PKC3 in intact cells. Structural information in CKA1/CKA1S enables delivery of adapters to the lateral plasma membrane surface (near tight junctions) in polarized epithelial cells. Thus, a PTB domain and PSDs collaborate in a novel fashion in CKA1/CKA1S to enable tethering and targeting of PKC3. Avid ligation of a PKC isoform is a previously unappreciated function for a PTB module.

15533940|t|Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (Hip1) and Hip1-related protein (Hip1R) bind the conserved sequence of clathrin light chains and thereby influence clathrin assembly in vitro and actin distribution in vivo.
15533940|t|Clathrin heavy and light chains form triskelia, which assemble into polyhedral coats of membrane vesicles that mediate transport for endocytosis and organelle biogenesis. Light chain subunits regulate clathrin assembly in vitro by suppressing spontaneous self-assembly of the heavy chains. The residues that play this regulatory role are at the N terminus of a conserved 22-amino acid sequence that is shared by all vertebrate light chains. Here we show that these regulatory residues and others in the conserved sequence mediate light chain interaction with Hip1 and Hip1R. These related proteins were previously found to be enriched in clathrin-coated vesicles and to promote clathrin assembly in vitro. We demonstrate Hip1R binding preference for light chains associated with clathrin heavy chain and show that Hip1R stimulation of clathrin assembly in vitro is blocked by mutations in the conserved sequence of light chains that abolish interaction with Hip1 and Hip1R. In vivo overexpression of a fragment of clathrin light chain comprising the Hip1R-binding region affected cellular actin distribution. Together these results suggest that the roles of Hip1 and Hip1R in affecting clathrin assembly and actin distribution are mediated by their interaction with the conserved sequence of clathrin light chains.

11801603|t|SMAC negatively regulates the anti-apoptotic activity of melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis (ML-IAP).
11801603|t|Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) physically interact with a variety of pro-apoptotic proteins and inhibit apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli. X-linked IAP (X-IAP) is a prototype IAP family member that inhibits several caspases, the effector proteases of apoptosis. The inhibitory activity of X-IAP is regulated by SMAC, a protein that is processed to its active form upon receipt of a death stimulus. Cleaved SMAC binds X-IAP and antagonizes its anti-apoptotic activity. Here we show that melanoma IAP (ML-IAP), a potent anti-cell death protein and caspase inhibitor, physically interacts with SMAC through its BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domain. In addition to binding full-length SMAC, ML-IAP BIR associates with SMAC peptides that are derived from the amino terminus of active, processed SMAC. This high affinity interaction is very specific and can be completely abolished by single amino acid mutations either in the amino terminus of active SMAC or in the BIR domain of ML-IAP. In cells expressing ML-IAP and X-IAP, SMAC coexpression or addition of SMAC peptides abrogates the ability of the IAPs to inhibit cell death. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SMAC peptides as a way to sensitize IAP-expressing cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents.

23520446|t|Protein phosphorylation profiling using an in situ proximity ligation assay: phosphorylation of AURKA-elicited EGFR-Thr654 and EGFR-Ser1046 in lung cancer cells.
23520446|t|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is up-regulated in lung cancer, involves the activation of mitogenic signals and triggers multiple signaling cascades. To dissect these EGFR cascades, we used 14 different phospho-EGFR antibodies to quantify protein phosphorylation using an in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Phosphorylation at EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 was EGF-dependent in the wild-type (WT) receptor but EGF-independent in a cell line carrying the EGFR-L858R mutation. Using a ProtoAarray    containing    5000 recombinant proteins on the protein chip, we found that AURKA interacted with the EGFR-L861Q mutant. Moreover, overexpression of EGFR could form a complex with AURKA, and the inhibitors of AURKA and EGFR decreased EGFR-Thr654 and -Ser1046 phosphorylation. Immunohistochemical staining of stage I lung adenocarcinoma tissues demonstrated a positive correlation between AURKA expression and phosphorylation of EGFR at Thr654 and Ser1046 in EGFR-mutant specimens, but not in EGFR-WT specimens.

8246997|t|A novel NF-kappa B complex containing p65 homodimers: implications for transcriptional control at the level of subunit dimerization.
8246997|t|The predominant inducible form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor is a heteromeric complex containing two Rel-related DNA-binding subunits, termed p65 and p50. Prior transfection studies have shown that when these p65 and p50 subunits are expressed independently as stable homodimers, p65 stimulates kappa B-directed transcription, whereas p50 functions as a kappa B-specific repressor. While authentic p50 homodimers (previously termed KBF1) have been detected in nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells, experimental evidence supporting the existence of p65 homodimers in vivo was lacking. We now provide direct biochemical evidence for the presence of an endogenous pool of inducible p65 homodimers in intact human T cells. As with the prototypical NF-kappa B p50-p65 heterodimer, this novel p65 homodimeric form of NF-kappa B is functionally sequestered in the cytoplasm but rapidly appears in the nuclear compartment following cellular stimulation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that the homodimerization function of p65 is dependent upon the presence of cysteine 216 and a conserved recognition motif for protein kinase A (RRPS; amino acids 273 to 276), both of which reside within a 91-amino-acid segment of the Rel homology domain that mediates self-association. In contrast, mutations at these two sites do not affect heterodimerization of p65 with p50 or its functional interaction with I kappa B alpha. These later findings indicate that neither homo- nor heterodimer formation is an absolute prerequisite for I kappa B alpha recognition of p65. Taken together with prior in vivo transcription studies, these results suggest that the biological activities of p65 and p50 homodimers are independently regulated, thereby providing an integrated and flexible control mechanism for the rapid activation and repression of NF-kappa B/Rel-directed gene expression.

23290633|t|Interactions between FATP4 and ichthyin in epidermal lipid processing may provide clues to the pathogenesis of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis.
23290633|t|BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is caused by mutations in >= 10 different genes, of which transglutaminase-1 (TGM1) predominates. A rare form is ichthyosis prematurity syndrome (IPS) caused by mutations in SLC27A4 encoding fatty acid transporter protein 4 (FATP4), believed to be an acyl-CoA synthetase activating long- and very-long-chain FA. Another ARCI is caused by mutations in NIPAL4, coding for ichthyin, which is proposed to be a magnesium transporter or a trans-membrane receptor. A possible interaction between FATP4 and ichthyin has not been studied before. OBJECTIVE: To find common denominators in the pathogenesis of ARCI. METHODS: FATP4 and ichthyin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and proximity ligation assay (PLA) in healthy and ARCI patient skin and in in vitro models of ARCI epidermis. RESULTS: Both proteins were expressed in the upper stratum granulosum of normal epidermis and PLA confirmed a close interaction between FATP4 and ichthyin. In IPS skin lacking FATP4 we found reduced ichthyin expression and this finding could be reproduced in organotypic epidermis with siRNA silenced SLC27A4. In contrast, increased FATP4 staining was found in patients with ichthyin (NIPAL4) mutations and in organotypic epidermis with silenced NIPAL4. In patients with TGM1 mutations, the expression of both FATP4 and ichthyin was increased, but the PLA signal was low probably indicating a malfunctioning protein interaction. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that FATP4, ichthyin and TGM1 interact in lipid processing essential for maintaining the epidermal barrier function. It is also hypothesized that ichthyin serves as Mg(2+)-transporter for FATP4 in this process.

12117771|t|Protocadherin LKC, a new candidate for a tumor suppressor of colon and liver cancers, its association with contact inhibition of cell proliferation.
12117771|t|Protocadherins are a major subfamily of the cadherin superfamily, but little is known about their functions and intracellular signal transduction. We cloned a novel human protocadherin gene, containing seven EC domains, and identified functional aspects of this gene. The gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and colon tissues, and was thus designated Protocadherin LKC. The expression of Protocadherin LKC is markedly reduced in cancers arising from these tissues at both transcriptional and protein levels. To investigate the effects of Protocadherin LKC expression in colon cancer, we introduced the gene into colon cancer cell line HCT116, which does not express this gene. Significantly, Protocadherin LKC expression induced contact inhibition of cell proliferation although it did not affect growth rate. When grown to post-confluence in monolayer cells cultures, Protocadherin LKC-expressing HCT116 no longer formed multiple cell layers and showed the typical paving stone morphology of normal epithelial cells. Furthermore, expression of Protocadherin LKC suppressed tumor formation of HCT116 cells in a nude mouse model. In addition, we identified a protein, hMAST205 (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-205 kDa), which interacted with Protocadherin LKC; the interaction occurring between the PDZ domain of hMAST205 and C-terminal tail of Protocadherin LKC. Our results suggest that Protocadherin LKC, which directly binds PDZ protein, is a molecular switch for contact inhibition of epithelial cells in the liver, kidney and colon tissues.

17298945|t|The conserved CPH domains of Cul7 and PARC are protein-protein interaction modules that bind the tetramerization domain of p53.
17298945|t|Cul7 is a member of the Cullin Ring Ligase (CRL) family and is required for normal mouse development and cellular proliferation. Recently, a region of Cul7 that is highly conserved in the p53-associated, Parkin-like cytoplasmic protein PARC, was shown to bind p53 directly. Here we identify the CPH domains (conserved domain within Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins) of both Cul7 and PARC as p53 interaction domains using size exclusion chromatography and NMR spectroscopy. We present the first structure of the evolutionarily conserved CPH domain and provide novel insight into the Cul7-p53 interaction. The NMR structure of the Cul7-CPH domain reveals a fold similar to peptide interaction modules such as the SH3, Tudor, and KOW domains. The p53 interaction surface of both Cul7 and PARC CPH domains was mapped to a conserved surface distinct from the analogous peptide-binding regions of SH3, KOW, and Tudor domains, suggesting a novel mode of interaction. The CPH domain interaction surface of p53 resides in the tetramerization domain and is formed by residues contributed by at least two subunits.

15141091|t|SIX1 mutations cause branchio-oto-renal syndrome by disruption of EYA1-SIX1-DNA complexes.
15141091|t|Urinary tract malformations constitute the most frequent cause of chronic renal failure in the first two decades of life. Branchio-otic (BO) syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder characterized by hearing loss. In branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, malformations of the kidney or urinary tract are associated. Haploinsufficiency for the human gene EYA1, a homologue of the Drosophila gene eyes absent (eya), causes BOR and BO syndromes. We recently mapped a locus for BOR/BO syndrome (BOS3) to human chromosome 14q23.1. Within the 33-megabase critical genetic interval, we located the SIX1, SIX4, and SIX6 genes, which act within a genetic network of EYA and PAX genes to regulate organogenesis. These genes, therefore, represented excellent candidate genes for BOS3. By direct sequencing of exons, we identified three different SIX1 mutations in four BOR/BO kindreds, thus identifying SIX1 as a gene causing BOR and BO syndromes. To elucidate how these mutations cause disease, we analyzed the functional role of these SIX1 mutations with respect to protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We demonstrate that all three mutations are crucial for Eya1-Six1 interaction, and the two mutations within the homeodomain region are essential for specific Six1-DNA binding. Identification of SIX1 mutations as causing BOR/BO offers insights into the molecular basis of otic and renal developmental diseases in humans.

15798189|t|Identification of a novel, intraperoxisomal pex14-binding site in pex13: association of pex13 with the docking complex is essential for peroxisomal matrix protein import.
15798189|t|The peroxisomal docking complex is a key component of the import machinery for matrix proteins. The core protein of this complex, Pex14, is thought to represent the initial docking site for the import receptors Pex5 and Pex7. Associated with this complex is a fraction of Pex13, another essential component of the import machinery. Here we demonstrate that Pex13 directly binds Pex14 not only via its SH3 domain but also via a novel intraperoxisomal site. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pex5 also contributes to the association of Pex13 with Pex14. Peroxisome function was affected only mildly by mutations within the novel Pex14 interaction site of Pex13 or by the non-Pex13-interacting mutant Pex5(W204A). However, when these constructs were tested in combination, PTS1-dependent import and growth on oleic acid were severely compromised. When the SH3 domain-mediated interaction of Pex13 with Pex14 was blocked on top of that, PTS2-dependent matrix protein import was completely compromised and Pex13 was no longer copurified with the docking complex. We conclude that the association of Pex13 with Pex14 is an essential step in peroxisomal protein import that is enabled by two direct interactions and by one that is mediated by Pex5, a result which indicates a novel, receptor-independent function of Pex5.

21601571|t|Valine 1532 of human BRC repeat 4 plays an important role in the interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51.
21601571|t|The breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA2 is essential for recombinational DNA repair. BRCA2 specifically binds to RAD51 via eight BRC repeat motifs and delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA breaks. In this study, a mammalian two-hybrid assay and competitive ELISA showed that the interaction between BRC repeat 4 (BRC4) and RAD51 was strengthened by the substitution of a single BRC4 amino acid from valine to isoleucine (V1532I). However, the cancer-associated V1532F mutant exhibited very weak interaction with RAD51. This study used a comparative analysis of BRC4 between animal species to identify V1532 as an important residue that interacts with RAD51.

8626665|t|Transcription factor IIA mutations show activator-specific defects and reveal a IIA function distinct from stimulation of TBP-DNA binding.
8626665|t|The general transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) binds to the TATA binding protein (TBP) and mediates transcriptional activation by distinct classes of activators. To elucidate the function of TFIIA in transcriptional activation, point mutants were created in the human TFIIA-gamma subunit at positions conserved with the yeast homologue. We have identified a class of TFIIA mutants that stimulate TBP-DNA binding (T-A complex) but fail to support transcriptional activation by several different activators, suggesting that these mutants are defective in their ability to facilitate an activation step subsequent to TBP promoter binding. Point mutations of the hydrophobic core of conserved residues from 65 to 74 resulted in various activation-defective phenotypes. These residues were found to be important for TFIIA gamma-gamma interactions, suggesting that gamma-gamma interactions are critical for TFIIA function as a coactivator. A subset of these TFIIA-gamma mutations disrupted transcriptional activation by all activators tested, except for the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded Zta protein. The gamma Y65F, gamma W72A, and gamma W72F mutants mediate Zta activation, but not GAL4-AH, AP-1, GAL4-CTF, or GAL4-VP16 activation. The gamma W72A mutant failed to stimulate TFIID-DNA binding (D-A complex) but was able to form a complex with TFIID and DNA in the presence of Zta (Z-D-A complex). Thus, the ability of Zta to activate transcription with gamma W72A appears to result from a unique ability to form the stable Z-D-A complex with this mutant. Our results show that different activators utilize the general factor TFIIA in unique ways and that TFIIA contributes transcription activation functions in addition to the facilitation of TBP-DNA binding.

11842245|t|Topors, a p53 and topoisomerase I binding protein, interacts with the adeno-associated virus (AAV-2) Rep78/68 proteins and enhances AAV-2 gene expression.
11842245|t|The adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) Rep proteins are essential for AAV DNA replication and regulation of AAV gene expression. We have identified a cellular protein interacting with Rep78 and Rep68 in yeast two-hybrid analysis and in GST pull-down assays. This protein has recently been described as both a p53 (p53BP3) and a topoisomerase I interacting protein (Topors). It contains an arginine/serine-rich domain, a RING finger domain and five PEST sequences. A minimal sequence sufficient for interaction with Rep was mapped to Topors amino acids 871 to 917. We show that the same region is also involved in the interaction with p53. Rep sequences involved in interaction with Topors were mapped to Rep amino acids 172 to 481. Overexpression of Topors stimulated AAV gene expression in the absence of helper virus, suggesting a function of Topors as a transcriptional regulator.

15526038|t|The synaptic acetylcholinesterase tetramer assembles around a polyproline II helix.
15526038|t|Functional localization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in vertebrate muscle and brain depends on interaction of the tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization (WAT) sequence, at the C-terminus of its major splice variant (T), with a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD), of the anchoring proteins, collagenous (ColQ) and proline-rich membrane anchor. The crystal structure of the WAT/PRAD complex reveals a novel supercoil structure in which four parallel WAT chains form a left-handed superhelix around an antiparallel left-handed PRAD helix resembling polyproline II. The WAT coiled coils possess a WWW motif making repetitive hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen-bond interactions with the PRAD. The WAT chains are related by an approximately 4-fold screw axis around the PRAD. Each WAT makes similar but unique interactions, consistent with an asymmetric pattern of disulfide linkages between the AChE tetramer subunits and ColQ. The P59Q mutation in ColQ, which causes congenital endplate AChE deficiency, and is located within the PRAD, disrupts crucial WAT-WAT and WAT-PRAD interactions. A model is proposed for the synaptic AChE(T) tetramer.

12601044|t|Alteration of protein-protein interactions of congenital cataract crystallin mutants.
12601044|t|PURPOSE: A recent study demonstrated the presence of protein-protein interactions among lens crystallins in a mammalian cell two-hybrid system assay and speculated about the significance of these interactions for protein solubility and lens transparency. The current study extends those findings to the following crystallin genes involved in some congenital cataracts: CRYAA (R116C), CRYAB (R120G), and CRYGC (T5P). METHODS: A mammalian two-hybrid system was used to assay the protein-protein interactions. Congenital cataract crystallin genes were cloned and fused into the two-hybrid system vectors (target and prey proteins). Together, with the third vector containing a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), they were cotransfected into human HeLa cells. The presence of protein-protein interactions and the strength of these interactions were assayed by CAT ELISA. RESULTS: The pattern of changes in protein-protein interactions of those congenital cataract gene products with the three major crystallins, alphaA- or alphaB-, betaB2-, and gammaC-crystallins, differed. For the T5P gammaC-crystallin, most of the interactions were decreased; for the R116C alphaA-crystallin, the interactions with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin decreased and those with alphaB-crystallin and heat-shock protein (Hsp)27 increased; and for the R120G alphaB-crystallin, the interactions with alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin decreased, but those with betaB2- and gammaC-crystallin increased slightly. An attempt was made to interpret the results on the basis of conformational change and disruption of dimeric interaction involving beta-strands. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate that crystallin mutations involved in congenital cataracts altered protein-protein interactions, which may contribute to decreased protein solubility and formation of cataract.

20972225|t|The Bowen-Conradi syndrome protein Nep1 (Emg1) has a dual role in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, as an essential assembly factor and in the methylation of   1191 in yeast 18S rRNA.
20972225|t|The Nep1 (Emg1) SPOUT-class methyltransferase is an essential ribosome assembly factor and the human Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BCS) is caused by a specific Nep1(D86G) mutation. We recently showed in vitro that Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Nep1 is a sequence-specific pseudouridine-N1-methyltransferase. Here, we show that in yeast the in vivo target site for Nep1-catalyzed methylation is located within loop 35 of the 18S rRNA that contains the unique hypermodification of U1191 to 1-methyl-3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-pseudouri-dine (m1acp3  ). Specific (14)C-methionine labelling of 18S rRNA in yeast mutants showed that Nep1 is not required for acp-modification but suggested a function in   1191 methylation. ESI MS analysis of acp-modified   -nucleosides in a /\nep1-mutant showed that Nep1 catalyzes the   1191 methylation in vivo. Remarkably, the restored growth of a nep1-1(ts) mutant upon addition of S-adenosylmethionine was even observed after preventing U1191 methylation in a /\snr35 mutant. This strongly suggests a dual Nep1 function, as   1191-methyltransferase and ribosome assembly factor. Interestingly, the Nep1 methyltransferase activity is not affected upon introduction of the BCS mutation. Instead, the mutated protein shows enhanced dimerization propensity and increased affinity for its RNA-target in vitro. Furthermore, the BCS mutation prevents nucleolar accumulation of Nep1, which could be the reason for reduced growth in yeast and the Bowen-Conradi syndrome.

19765570|t|The Galpha4 G protein subunit interacts with the MAP kinase ERK2 using a D-motif that regulates developmental morphogenesis in Dictyostelium.
19765570|t|G protein Galpha subunits contribute to the specificity of different signal transduction pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum but Galpha subunit-effector interactions have not been previously identified. The requirement of the Dictyostelium Galpha4 subunit for MAP kinase (MAPK) activation and the identification of a putative MAPK docking site (D-motif) in this subunit suggested a possible interaction between the Galpha4 subunit and MAPKs. In vivo association of the Galpha4 subunit and ERK2 was demonstrated by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Alteration of the D-motif reduced Galpha4 subunit-ERK2 interactions but only slightly altered MAPK activation in response to folate. Expression of the Galpha4 subunit with the altered D-motif in galpha4(-)cells allowed for slug formation but not the morphogenesis associated with culmination. Expression of this mutant Galpha4 subunit was sufficient to rescue chemotactic movement to folate. Alteration of the D-motif also reduced the aggregation defect associated with constitutively active Galpha4 subunits. These results suggest Galpha4 subunit-MAPK interactions are necessary for developmental morphogenesis but not for chemotaxis to folate.

12050133|t|Six3-mediated auto repression and eye development requires its interaction with members of the Groucho-related family of co-repressors.
12050133|t|Recent findings suggest that Six3, a member of the evolutionarily conserved So/Six homeodomain family, plays an important role in vertebrate visual system development. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which this function is accomplished. Although several members of the So/Six gene family interact with members of the eyes absent (Eya) gene family and function as transcriptional activators, Six3 does not interact with any known member of the Eya family. Here, we report that Grg4 and Grg5, mouse counterparts of the Drosophila transcriptional co-repressor Groucho, interact with mouse Six3 and its closely related member Six6, which may also be involved in vertebrate eye development. The specificity of the interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation of Six3 and Grg4 complexes from cell lines. We also show that the interaction between Six3 and Grg5 requires the Q domain of Grg5 and a conserved phenylalanine residue present in an eh1-like motif located in the Six domain of Six3. The pattern of Grg5 expression in the mouse ventral forebrain and developing optic vesicles overlapped that previously reported for Six3 and Six6. Using PCR, we identified a specific DNA motif that is bound by Six3 and we demonstrated that Six3 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor upon its interaction with Groucho-related members. We also demonstrated that this interaction is required for Six3 auto repression. The biological significance of this interaction in the retina and lens was assessed by overexpression experiments using either wild type full-length Six3 cDNA or a mutated form of this gene in which the interaction with Groucho proteins was disrupted. Overexpression of wild type Six3 by in vivo retroviral infection of newborn rat retinae led to an altered photoreceptor phenotype, while the in ovo electroporation of chicken embryos resulted in failure of lens placode invagination and production of delta-crystallin-negative cells within the placode. These specific alterations were not seen when the mutated form of Six3 cDNA was used in similar experimental approaches, indicating that Six3 interaction with Groucho proteins plays an essential role in vertebrate eye development.

19647741|t|Phosphorylation of more than one site is required for tight interaction of human tau protein with 14-3-3zeta.
19647741|t|Serine residues phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in the shortest isoform of human tau protein (tau3) were sequentially replaced by alanine and interaction of phosphorylated tau3 and its mutants with 14-3-3 was investigated. Mutation S156A slightly decreased interaction of phosphorylated tau3 with 14-3-3. Double mutations S156A/S267A and especially S156A/S235A, strongly inhibited interaction of phosphorylated tau3 with 14-3-3. Thus, two sites located in the Pro-rich region and in the pseudo repeats of tau3 are involved in phosphorylation-dependent interaction of tau3 with 14-3-3. The state of tau3 phosphorylation affects the mode of 14-3-3 binding and by this means might modify tau filament formation.

12869544|t|Dimerization of Toc-GTPases at the chloroplast protein import machinery.
12869544|t|Import of chloroplast precursor proteins is controlled by the coordinate action of two homologous GTPases, Toc159 and Toc33, located at the cytosol-outer membrane interface. Recent studies in Arabidopsis showed that the cytosolic form of the precursor binding protein Toc159 is targeted to its receptor at the import machinery, Toc33, via heterodimerization of their GTP-binding domains. Toc33 may also form GDP-bound homodimers, as suggested by the crystal structure of its pea ortholog. Moreover, the structural data suggested that arginine 130 (Arg130) of Arabidopsis Toc33 may function as a GTPase-activating "arginine-finger" at the other monomer in the Toc33 dimer. Here, we demonstrate that Arg130 of Toc33 does not function as an Arginine-finger. A mutant, Toc33-R130A, binds and hydrolyzes GTP like the wild type. However, we demonstrate that Arg130 is involved in both homodimerization of Toc33 and in heterodimerization with the GTP-binding domain of Toc159. The dependence of Toc33 homodimerization on Arg130 is mutual, requiring the presence of Arg130 at both monomers. As the GTPase is not activated by dimerization, it may be activated independently at either monomer, possibly even before dimerization. Independent regulation of GTPase activity may serve to coordinate the interactions of the GTPases during the import of proteins into the chloroplast.

21209940|t|A two-hybrid assay to study protein interactions within the secretory pathway.
21209940|t|Interactions of transcriptional activators are difficult to study using transcription-based two-hybrid assays due to potent activation resulting in false positives. Here we report the development of the Golgi two-hybrid (G2H), a method that interrogates protein interactions within the Golgi, where transcriptional activators can be assayed with negligible background. The G2H relies on cell surface glycosylation to report extracellularly on protein-protein interactions occurring within the secretory pathway. In the G2H, protein pairs are fused to modular domains of the reporter glycosyltransferase, Och1p, and proper cell wall formation due to Och1p activity is observed only when a pair of proteins interacts. Cells containing interacting protein pairs are identified by selectable phenotypes associated with Och1p activity and proper cell wall formation: cells that have interacting proteins grow under selective conditions and display weak wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding by flow cytometry, whereas cells that lack interacting proteins display stunted growth and strong WGA binding. Using this assay, we detected the interaction between transcription factor MyoD and its binding partner Id2. Interfering mutations along the MyoD:Id2 interaction interface ablated signal in the G2H assay. Furthermore, we used the G2H to detect interactions of the activation domain of Gal4p with a variety of binding partners. Finally, selective conditions were used to enrich for cells encoding interacting partners. The G2H detects protein-protein interactions that cannot be identified via traditional two-hybrid methods and should be broadly useful for probing previously inaccessible subsets of the interactome, including transcriptional activators and proteins that traffic through the secretory pathway.

11163258|t|LIS1 regulates CNS lamination by interacting with mNudE, a central component of the centrosome.
11163258|t|LIS1, a microtubule-associated protein, is required for neuronal migration, but the precise mechanism of LIS1 function is unknown. We identified a LIS1 interacting protein encoded by a mouse homolog of NUDE, a nuclear distribution gene in A. nidulans and a multicopy suppressor of the LIS1 homolog, NUDF. mNudE is located in the centrosome or microtubule organizing center (MTOC), and interacts with six different centrosomal proteins. Overexpression of mNudE dissociates gamma-tubulin from the centrosome and disrupts microtubule organization. Missense mutations that disrupt LIS1 function block LIS1-mNudE binding. Moreover, misexpression of the LIS1 binding domain of mNudE in Xenopus embryos disrupts the architecture and lamination of the CNS. Thus, LIS1-mNudE interactions may regulate neuronal migration through dynamic reorganization of the MTOC.

11134025|t|Structural properties and mechanisms that govern association of C kinase adapter 1 with protein kinase C3 and the cell periphery.
11134025|t|Association of an atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) with an adapter protein can affect the location, activity, substrate specificity, and physiological role of the phosphotransferase. Knowledge of mechanisms that govern formation and intracellular targeting of aPKC.adapter protein complexes is limited. Caenorhabditis elegans protein kinase C adapter proteins (CKA1 and CKA1S) bind and target aPKCs and provide prototypes for mechanistic analysis. CKA1 binds an aPKC (PKC3) via a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. A distinct, Arg/Lys-rich N-terminal region targets CKA1 to the cell periphery. We discovered that a short segment ((212)GGIDNGAFHEHEI(224)) of the V(2) (linker) region of PKC3 creates a binding surface that interacts with the PTB domain of CKA1/CKA1S. The docking domain of PKC3 differs from classical PTB ligands by the absence of Tyr and Pro. Substitution of Ile(214), Asn(216), or Phe(219) with Ala abrogates binding of PKC3 with CKA1; these residues cooperatively configure a docking site that complements an apolar surface of the CKA1 PTB domain. Phosphorylation site domains (PSD1, residues 11-25; PSD2, residues 61-77) in CKA1 route the adapter (and tethered PKC3) to the cell periphery. Phosphorylation of Ser(17) and Ser(65) in PSDs 1 and 2 elicits translocation of CKA1 from the cell surface to cytoplasm. Activities of DAG-stimulated PKCs and opposing protein Ser/Thr phosphatases can dynamically regulate the distribution of adapter protein between the cell periphery and cytoplasm.

VirB8 is an essential inner membrane component of type IV secretion systems, and it is believed to form a homodimer. In the absence of VirB8, the levels of several other VirB proteins were reduced (VirB1, VirB3, VirB4, VirB5, VirB6, VirB7, and VirB11) in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, underlining its importance for complex stability. To assess the importance of dimerization, we changed residues at the predicted dimer interface (V97, A100, Q93, and E94) in order to strengthen or to abolish dimerization. We verified the impact of the changes on dimerization in vitro with purified V97 variants, followed by analysis of the in vivo consequences in a complemented virB8 deletion strain. Dimer formation was observed in vivo after the introduction of a cysteine residue at the predicted interface (V97C), and this variant supported DNA transfer, but the formation of elongated T pili was not detected by the standard pilus isolation technique. Variants with changes at V97 and A100 that weaken dimerization did not support type IV secretion system functions. The T-pilus component VirB2 cofractionated with high-molecular-mass core protein complexes extracted from the membranes, and the presence of VirB8 as well as its dimer interface were important for this association. We conclude that the VirB8 dimer interface is required for T4SS function, for the stabilization of many VirB proteins, and for targeting of VirB2 to the T-pilus assembly site.

21382479|t|Caveolin-1 mediates Fas-BID signaling in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis.
21382479|t|Fas-mediated apoptosis is a crucial cellular event. Fas, the Fas-associated death domain, and caspase 8 form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Activated caspase 8 mediates the extrinsic pathways and cleaves cytosolic BID. Truncated BID (tBID) translocates to the mitochondria, facilitates the release of cytochrome c, and activates the intrinsic pathways. However, the mechanism causing these DISC components to aggregate and form the complex remains unclear. We found that Cav-1 regulated Fas signaling and mediated the communication between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Shortly after hyperoxia (4 h), the colocalization and interaction of Cav-1 and Fas increased, followed by Fas multimer and DISC formation. Deletion of Cav-1 (Cav-1-/-) disrupted DISC formation. Further, Cav-1 interacted with BID. Mutation of Cav-1 Y14 tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y14F) disrupted the hyperoxia-induced interaction between BID and Cav-1 and subsequently yielded a decreased level of tBID and resistance to hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine decreased the Cav-1-Fas interaction. Deletion of glutathione peroxidase-2 using siRNA aggravated the BID-Cav-1 interaction and tBID formation. Taken together, these results indicate that Cav-1 regulates hyperoxia/ROS-induced apoptosis through interactions with Fas and BID, probably via Fas palmitoylation and Cav-1 Y14 phosphorylation, respectively.

10713164|t|SKIP, a CBF1-associated protein, interacts with the ankyrin repeat domain of NotchIC To facilitate NotchIC function.
10713164|t|Notch proteins are transmembrane receptors that mediate intercell communication and direct individual cell fate decisions. The activated intracellular form of Notch, NotchIC, translocates to the nucleus, where it targets the DNA binding protein CBF1. CBF1 mediates transcriptional repression through the recruitment of an SMRT-histone deacetylase-containing corepressor complex. We have examined the mechanism whereby NotchIC overcomes CBF1-mediated transcriptional repression. We identified SKIP (Ski-interacting protein) as a CBF1 binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Both CBF1 and SKIP are highly conserved evolutionarily, and the SKIP-CBF1 interaction is also conserved in assays using the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster SKIP homologs. Protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated interaction between SKIP and the corepressor SMRT. More surprisingly, SKIP also interacted with NotchIC. The SMRT and NotchIC interactions were mutually exclusive. In competition binding experiments SMRT displaced NotchIC from CBF1 and from SKIP. Contact with SKIP is required for biological activity of NotchIC. A mutation in the fourth ankyrin repeat that abolished Notch signal transduction did not affect interaction with CBF1 but abolished interaction with SKIP. Further, NotchIC was unable to block muscle cell differentiation in myoblasts expressing antisense SKIP. The results suggest a model in which NotchIC activates responsive promoters by competing with the SMRT-corepressor complex for contacts on both CBF1 and SKIP.

21615688|t|Identification of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase kinase 2 as a novel partner of the scaffolding protein human homolog of disc-large.
21615688|t|Human disc-large homolog (hDlg), also known as synapse-associated protein 97, is a scaffold protein, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family, implicated in neuronal synapses and epithelial-epithelial cell junctions whose expression and function remains poorly characterized in most tissues, particularly in the vasculature. In human vascular tissues, hDlg is highly expressed in smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human aorta cDNA library, we identified mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-responsive kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)2, a member of the ERK cascade, as an hDlg binding partner. Site-directed mutagenesis showed a major involvement of the PSD-95, disc-large, ZO-1 domain-2 of hDlg and the C-terminal sequence RTAV of MEK2 in this interaction. Coimmunoprecipitation assays in both human VSMCs and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, demonstrated that endogenous hDlg physically interacts with MEK2 but not with MEK1. Confocal microscopy suggested a colocalization of the two proteins at the inner layer of the plasma membrane of confluent human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and in a perinuclear area in human VSMCs. Additionally, hDlg also associates with the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules in these latter cells. Taken together, these findings allow us to hypothesize that hDlg acts as a MEK2-specific scaffold protein for the ERK signaling pathway, and may improve our understanding of how scaffold proteins, such as hDlg, differentially tune MEK1/MEK2 signaling and cell responses.

9430655|t|NHE-RF, a regulatory cofactor for Na(+)-H+ exchange, is a common interactor for merlin and ERM (MERM) proteins.
9430655|t|We have identified the human homologue of a regulatory cofactor of Na(+)-H+ exchanger (NHE-RF) as a novel interactor for merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein. NHE-RF mediates protein kinase A regulation of Na(+)-H+ exchanger NHE3 to which it is thought to bind via one of its two PDZ domains. The carboxyl-terminal region of NHE-RF, downstream of the PDZ domains, interacts with the amino-terminal protein 4.1 domain-containing segment of merlin in yeast two-hybrid assays. This interaction also occurs in affinity binding assays with full-length NHE-RF expressed in COS-7 cells. NHE-RF binds to the related ERM proteins, moesin and radixin. We have localized human NHE-RF to actin-rich structures such as membrane ruffles, microvilli, and filopodia in HeLa and COS-7 cells, where it co-localizes with merlin and moesin. These findings suggest that hNHE-RF and its binding partners may participate in a larger complex (one component of which might be a Na(+)-H+ exchanger) that could be crucial for the actin filament assembly activated by the ERM proteins and for the tumor suppressor function of merlin.

9343432|t|A domain shared by the Polycomb group proteins Scm and ph mediates heterotypic and homotypic interactions.
9343432|t|The Sex comb on midleg (Scm) and polyhomeotic (ph) proteins are members of the Polycomb group (PcG) of transcriptional repressors. PcG proteins maintain differential patterns of homeotic gene expression during development in Drosophila flies. The Scm and ph proteins share a homology domain with 38% identity over a length of 65 amino acids, termed the SPM domain, that is located at their respective C termini. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro protein-binding assays, we show that the SPM domain mediates direct interaction between Scm and ph. Binding studies with isolated SPM domains from Scm and ph show that the domain is sufficient for these protein interactions. These studies also show that the Scm-ph and Scm-Scm domain interactions are much stronger than the ph-ph domain interaction, indicating that the isolated domain has intrinsic binding specificity determinants. Analysis of site-directed point mutations identifies residues that are important for SPM domain function. These binding properties, predicted alpha-helical secondary structure, and conservation of hydrophobic residues prompt comparisons of the SPM domain to the helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains used for homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions in other transcriptional regulators. In addition to in vitro studies, we show colocalization of the Scm and ph proteins at polytene chromosome sites in vivo. We discuss the possible roles of the SPM domain in the assembly or function of molecular complexes of PcG proteins.

24464040|t|LRRK2 regulates synaptogenesis and dopamine receptor activation through modulation of PKA activity.
24464040|t|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is enriched in the striatal projection neurons (SPNs). We found that LRRK2 negatively regulates protein kinase A (PKA) activity in the SPNs during synaptogenesis and in response to dopamine receptor Drd1 activation. LRRK2 interacted with PKA regulatory subunit IIb (PKARIIb). A lack of LRRK2 promoted the synaptic translocation of PKA and increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation of actin-disassembling enzyme cofilin and glutamate receptor GluR1, resulting in abnormal synaptogenesis and transmission in the developing SPNs. Furthermore, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 was also aberrantly enhanced in the striatum of young and aged Lrrk2(-/-) mice after treatment with a Drd1 agonist. Notably, a Parkinson's disease-related Lrrk2 R1441C missense mutation that impaired the interaction of LRRK2 with PKARIIb also induced excessive PKA activity in the SPNs. Our findings reveal a previously unknown regulatory role for LRRK2 in PKA signaling and suggest a pathogenic mechanism of SPN dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

23949442|t|LRRK2 phosphorylates Snapin and inhibits interaction of Snapin with SNAP-25.
23949442|t|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a gene that, upon mutation, causes autosomal-dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that Snapin, a SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein-25) interacting protein, interacts with LRRK2. An in vitro kinase assay exhibited that Snapin is phosphorylated by LRRK2. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay showed that LRRK2 may interact with Snapin via its Ras-of-complex (ROC) and N-terminal domains, with no significant difference on interaction of Snapin with LRRK2 wild type (WT) or its pathogenic mutants. Further analysis by mutation study revealed that Threonine 117 of Snapin is one of the sites phosphorylated by LRRK2. Furthermore, a Snapin T117D phosphomimetic mutant decreased its interaction with SNAP-25 in the GST pull-down assay. SNAP-25 is a component of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment protein REceptor) complex and is critical for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Incubation of rat brain lysate with recombinant Snapin T117D, but not WT, protein caused decreased interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNARE complex based on a co-immunoprecipitation assay. We further found that LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Snapin in the hippocampal neurons resulted in a decrease in the number of readily releasable vesicles and the extent of exocytotic release. Combined, these data suggest that LRRK2 may regulate neurotransmitter release via control of Snapin function by inhibitory phosphorylation.

15173383|t|The C-terminal zinc finger of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta is responsible for direct interaction with the B-subunit.
15173383|t|DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) plays a central role in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication, repair and recombination. In fission yeast, Pol delta is a tetrameric enzyme, comprising the catalytic subunit Pol3 and three smaller subunits, Cdc1, Cdc27 and Cdm1. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between Pol3 and Cdc1, the B-subunit of the complex. Here it is shown that removal of the tandem zinc finger modules located at the C-terminus of Pol3 by targeted proteolysis renders the Pol3 protein non-functional in vivo, and that the C-terminal zinc finger module ZnF2 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the B-subunit in vivo and in vitro. Extensive mutagenesis of the ZnF2 module identifies important residues for B-subunit binding. In particular, disruption of the ZnF2 module by substitution of the putative metal-coordinating cysteines with alanine abolishes B-subunit binding and in vivo function. Finally, evidence is presented suggesting that the ZnF region is post-translationally modified in fission yeast cells.

22279592|t|ErbB2, EphrinB1, Src kinase and PTPN13 signaling complex regulates MAP kinase signaling in human cancers.
22279592|t|In non-cancerous cells, phosphorylated proteins exist transiently, becoming de-phosphorylated by specific phosphatases that terminate propagation of signaling pathways. In cancers, compromised phosphatase activity and/or expression occur and contribute to tumor phenotype. The non-receptor phosphatase, PTPN13, has recently been dubbed a putative tumor suppressor. It decreased expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival. Here we show that PTPN13 regulates a new signaling complex in breast cancer consisting of ErbB2, Src, and EphrinB1. To our knowledge, this signaling complex has not been previously described. Co-immunoprecipitation and localization studies demonstrate that EphrinB1, a PTPN13 substrate, interacts with ErbB2. In addition, the oncogenic V660E ErbB2 mutation enhances this interaction, while Src kinase mediates EphrinB1 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP Kinase signaling. Decreased PTPN13 function further enhances signaling. The association of oncogene kinases (ErbB2, Src), a signaling transmembrane ligand (EphrinB1) and a phosphatase tumor suppressor (PTPN13) suggest that EphrinB1 may be a relevant therapeutic target in breast cancers harboring ErbB2-activating mutations and decreased PTPN13 expression.

22291198|t|The ubiquitin E3 ligase LOSS OF GDU2 is required for GLUTAMINE DUMPER1-induced amino acid secretion in Arabidopsis.
22291198|t|Amino acids serve as transport forms for organic nitrogen in the plant, and multiple transport steps are involved in cellular import and export. While the nature of the export mechanism is unknown, overexpression of GLUTAMINE DUMPER1 (GDU1) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) led to increased amino acid export. To gain insight into GDU1's role, we searched for ethyl-methanesulfonate suppressor mutants and performed yeast-two-hybrid screens. Both methods uncovered the same gene, LOSS OF GDU2 (LOG2), which encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. The interaction between LOG2 and GDU1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down, in vitro ubiquitination, and in planta coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation indicated that LOG2 and GDU1 both localized to membranes and were enriched at the plasma membrane. LOG2 expression overlapped with GDU1 in the xylem and phloem tissues of Arabidopsis. The GDU1 protein encoded by the previously characterized intragenic suppressor mutant log1-1, with an arginine in place of a conserved glycine, failed to interact in the multiple assays, suggesting that the Gdu1D phenotype requires the interaction of GDU1 with LOG2. This hypothesis was supported by suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype after reduction of LOG2 expression using either artificial microRNAs or a LOG2 T-DNA insertion. Altogether, in accordance with the emerging bulk of data showing membrane protein regulation via ubiquitination, these data suggest that the interaction of GDU1 and the ubiquitin ligase LOG2 plays a significant role in the regulation of amino acid export from plant cells.

20371544|t|Mutations in MUSK causing congenital myasthenic syndrome impair MuSK-Dok-7 interaction.
20371544|t|We describe a severe congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) caused by two missense mutations in the gene encoding the muscle specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MUSK). The identified MUSK mutations M605I and A727V are both located in the kinase domain of MuSK. Intracellular microelectrode recordings and microscopy studies of the neuromuscular junction conducted in an anconeus muscle biopsy revealed decreased miniature endplate potential amplitudes, reduced endplate size and simplification of secondary synaptic folds, which were consistent with postsynaptic deficit. The study also showed a striking reduction of the endplate potential quantal content, consistent with additional presynaptic failure. Expression studies in MuSK deficient myotubes revealed that A727V, which is located within the catalytic loop of the enzyme, caused severe impairment of agrin-dependent MuSK phosphorylation, aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and interaction of MuSK with Dok-7, an essential intracellular binding protein of MuSK. In contrast, M605I, resulted in only moderate impairment of agrin-dependent MuSK phosphorylation, aggregation of AChRs and interaction of MuSK with Dok-7. There was no impairment of interaction of mutants with either the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, Lrp4 (a co-receptor of agrin) or with the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila tumorous imaginal discs (Tid1). Our findings demonstrate that missense mutations in MUSK can result in a severe form of CMS and indicate that the inability of MuSK mutants to interact with Dok-7, but not with Lrp4 or Tid1, is a major determinant of the pathogenesis of the CMS caused by MUSK mutations.

21063388|t|Two PABPC1-binding sites in GW182 proteins promote miRNA-mediated gene silencing.
21063388|t|miRNA-mediated gene silencing requires the GW182 proteins, which are characterized by an N-terminal domain that interacts with Argonaute proteins (AGOs), and a C-terminal silencing domain (SD). In Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) GW182 and a human (Hs) orthologue, TNRC6C, the SD was previously shown to interact with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). Here, we show that two regions of GW182 proteins interact with PABPC1: the first contains a PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2; as shown before for TNRC6C) and the second contains the M2 and C-terminal sequences in the SD. The latter mediates indirect binding to the PABPC1 N-terminal domain. In D. melanogaster cells, the second binding site dominates; however, in HsTNRC6A-C the PAM2 motif is essential for binding to both Hs and DmPABPC1. Accordingly, a single amino acid substitution in the TNRC6A-C PAM2 motif abolishes the interaction with PABPC1. This mutation also impairs TNRC6s silencing activity. Our findings reveal that despite species-specific differences in the relative strength of the PABPC1-binding sites, the interaction between GW182 proteins and PABPC1 is critical for miRNA-mediated silencing in animal cells.

14561633|t|A contradictory GLABRA3 allele helps define gene interactions controlling trichome development in Arabidopsis.
14561633|t|Previously characterized Arabidopsis gl3 mutants have trichomes that are smaller, less branched and undergo fewer rounds of endoreplication than wild-type trichomes. A new gl3 mutant, called gl3-sst, has oddly shaped trichomes that over expand during early development, undergo more endoreduplication and that have a striking nuclear morphology. The mutant nuclei consist of many interconnected lobes; however, only a single set of polytene-like chromosomes reside in the mutant nuclei. The predicted gl3-sst polypeptide has a Leu to Phe substitution (codon 78) within a region responsible for protein-protein interaction. Yeast interaction assays comparing GL3 with gl3-sst proteins show that the mutant protein interaction with GL1 and TTG1 is decreased by 75% and 50%, respectively, but there is no difference in its interaction with TRY. Furthermore, TRY has the ability to prevent the GL1 GL3 interaction and the GL1 gl3-sst interaction is even more sensitive to TRY. Analysis of plants expressing functional GFP-tagged versions of GL1, GL3 and TRY show that the proteins are localized in trichome nuclei. These results have been used to model trichome initiation in terms of protein interactions and threshold levels of activator complex.

18688255|t|Conserved motifs in both CPSF73 and CPSF100 are required to assemble the active endonuclease for histone mRNA 3'-end maturation.
18688255|t|In eukaryotes, the process of messenger RNA 3'-end formation involves endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript followed by synthesis of the poly(A) tail. The complex machinery involved in this maturation process contains two proteins of the metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) superfamily, the 73 and 100 kDa subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). By using an in vitro system to assess point mutations in these two mammalian proteins, we found that conserved residues from the MBL motifs of both polypeptides are required for assembly of the endonuclease activity that cleaves histone pre-mRNAs. This indicates that CPSF73 and CPSF100 act together in the process of maturation of eukaryotic pre-messenger RNAs, similar to other members of the MBL family, RNases Z and J, which function as homodimers.

11923305|t|Mitotic activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha and regulation of its Src-mediated transforming activity by its sites of protein kinase C phosphorylation.
11923305|t|During mitosis, the catalytic activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) alpha is enhanced, and its inhibitory binding to Grb2, which specifically blocks Src dephosphorylation, is decreased. These effects act synergistically to activate Src in mitosis. We show here that these effects are abrogated by mutation of Ser180 and/or Ser204, the sites of protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation within PTPalpha. Moreover, either a Ser-to-Ala substitution or serine dephosphorylation specifically eliminated the ability of PTPalpha to dephosphorylate and activate Src even during interphase. This explains why the substitutions eliminated PTPalpha transforming activity, even though PTPalpha interphase dephosphorylation of nonspecific substrates was only slightly decreased. This occurred without change in the phosphorylation of PTPalpha at Tyr789, which is required for "phosphotyrosine displacement" during Src dephosphorylation. Thus, in addition to increasing PTPalpha nonspecific catalytic activity, Ser180 and Ser204 phosphorylation (along with Tyr789 phosphorylation) regulates PTPalpha substrate specificity. This involves serine phosphorylation-dependent differential modulation of the affinity of Tyr(P)789 for the Src and Grb2 SH2 domains. The results suggest that protein kinase C may participate in the mitotic activation of PTPalpha and Src and that there are intramolecular interactions between the PTPalpha C-terminal and membrane-proximal regions that are regulated, at least in part, by serine phosphorylation.

12221107|t|ARH is a modular adaptor protein that interacts with the LDL receptor, clathrin, and AP-2.
12221107|t|Mutations in the phosphotyrosine binding domain protein ARH cause autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, a disorder caused by defective internalization of low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) in the liver. To examine the function of ARH, we used pull-down experiments to test for interactions between ARH, the LDLR, and proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of ARH interacted with the internalization sequence (NPVY) in the cytoplasmic tail of LDLR in a sequence-specific manner. Mutations in the NPVY sequence that were previously shown to decrease LDLR internalization abolished in vitro binding to ARH. Recombinant ARH bound purified bovine clathrin with high affinity (K(D), approximately 44 nm). The interaction between ARH and clathrin was mapped to a canonical clathrin box sequence (LLDLE) in ARH and to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain. A highly conserved 20-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal region of ARH bound the beta(2)-adaptin subunit of AP-2. Mutation of a glutamic acid residue in the appendage domain of beta(2)-adaptin that is required for interaction with the adapter protein beta-arrestin markedly reduced binding to ARH. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ARH functions as an adaptor protein that couples LDLR to the endocytic machinery.

20594350|t|A novel mechanism of cell growth regulation by Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Regulatory Protein (CARP)-1.
20594350|t|BACKGROUND: CARP-1/CCAR1, a perinuclear phospho-protein, regulates signaling by adriamycin, steroids, or growth factors. However, intracellular events that regulate CARP-1-dependent cell growth are not fully understood. RESULTS: Here we investigated whether CARP-1 is involved in signaling induced by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. Treatments of human breast cancer cells with H89 resulted in apoptosis that involved enhanced CARP-1 threonine phosphorylation and expression. Depletion of CARP-1, on the other hand, abrogates apoptosis induced by H89. CARP-1 binds with signal transducer TAZ and over-expression of TAZ inhibits apoptosis by CARP-1. CARP-1 (651-759) interacts with a novel, N-terminal epitope of TAZ. H89 treatment stimulates threonine phosphorylation of CARP-1 (651-759), while substitution of threonine667 to alanine interferes with its binding with TAZ and apoptosis by H89. In addition, expression of wild type or CARP-1 (651-759) causes loss of c-myc expression due, in part, to suppression of c-myc transcription. CONCLUSIONS: CARP-1 threonine667 regulates H89-dependent signaling by a novel pathway that involves modulation of CARP-1 interaction with TAZ and transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc.

15733871|t|WRKY group IId transcription factors interact with calmodulin.
15733871|t|Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-binding protein known to regulate diverse cellular functions by modulating the activity of various target proteins. We isolated a cDNA encoding AtWRKY7, a novel CaM-binding transcription factor, from an Arabidopsis expression library with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated CaM. CaM binds specifically to the Ca(2+)-dependent CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of AtWRKY7, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis, a gel mobility shift assay, a split-ubiquitin assay, and a competition assay using a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. Furthermore, we show that the CaMBD of AtWRKY7 is a conserved structural motif (C-motif) found in group IId of the WRKY protein family.

12634384|t|The abundant nuclear enzyme PARP participates in the life cycle of simian virus 40 and is stimulated by minor capsid protein VP3.
12634384|t|The abundant nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) functions in DNA damage surveillance and repair and at the decision between apoptosis and necrosis. Here we show that PARP binds to simian virus 40 (SV40) capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Furthermore, its enzymatic activity is stimulated by VP3 but not by VP1. Experiments with purified mutant proteins demonstrated that the PARP binding domain in VP3 is localized to the 35 carboxy-terminal amino acids, while a larger peptide of 49 amino acids was required for full stimulation of its activity. The addition of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), a known competitive inhibitor of PARP, demonstrated that PARP participates in the SV40 life cycle. The titer of SV40 propagated on CV-1 cells was reduced by 3-AB in a dose-dependent manner. Additional experiments showed that 3-AB did not affect viral DNA replication or capsid protein production. PARP did not modify the viral capsid proteins in in vitro poly(ADP-ribosylation) assays, implying that it does not affect SV40 infectivity. On the other hand, it greatly reduced the magnitude of the host cytopathic effects, a hallmark of SV40 infection. Additional experiments suggested that the stimulation of PARP activity by VP3 leads the infected cell to a necrotic pathway, characterized by the loss of membrane integrity, thus facilitating the release of mature SV40 virions from the cells. Our studies identified a novel function of the minor capsid protein VP3 in the recruitment of PARP for the SV40 lytic process.

12692227|t|The Papillomavirus E2 protein binds to and synergizes with C/EBP factors involved in keratinocyte differentiation.
12692227|t|The papillomavirus life cycle is closely linked to the differentiation program of the host keratinocyte. Thus, late gene expression and viral maturation are restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes. A variety of cellular transcription factors including those of the C/EBP family are involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. In this study we show that the papillomavirus transcription factor E2 cooperates with C/EBPalpha and -beta in transcriptional activation. This synergism was independent of an E2 binding site. E2 and C/EBP factors synergistically transactivated a synthetic promoter construct containing classical C/EBPbeta sites and the C/EBPalpha-responsive proximal promoter of the involucrin gene, which is naturally expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. C/EBPalpha or -beta coprecipitated with E2 proteins derived from human papillomavirus type 8 (HPV8), HPV16, HPV18, and bovine papillomavirus type 1 in vitro and in vivo, indicating complex formation by the cellular and viral factors. The interaction domains could be mapped to the C terminus of E2 and amino acids 261 to 302 located within the bZIP motif of C/EBPbeta. Our data suggest that E2, via its interaction with C/EBP factors, may contribute to enhancing keratinocyte differentiation, which is suppressed by the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 in HPV-induced lesions.

16537536|t|Asf1 is required for viability and chromatin assembly during DNA replication in vertebrate cells.
16537536|t|Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1), a well conserved protein from yeast to humans, acts as a histone chaperone and is predicted to participate in a variety of chromatin-mediated cellular processes. To investigate the physiological role of vertebrate Asf1 in vivo, we generated a conditional Asf1-deficient mutant from chicken DT40 cells. Induction of Asf1 depletion resulted in the accumulation of cells in S phase with decreased DNA replication and increased mitotic aberrancy forming multipolar spindles, leading to cell death. In addition, nascent chromatin in Asf1-depleted cells showed increased nuclease sensitivity, indicating impaired nucleosome assembly during DNA replication. Complementation analyses revealed that the functional domain of Asf1 for cell viability was confined to the N-terminal core domain (amino acids 1-155) that is a binding platform for histones H3/H4, CAF-1p60, and HIRA, whereas Asf1 mutant proteins, abolishing binding abilities with both p60 and HIRA, exhibit no effect on viability. These results together indicate that the vertebrate Asf1 plays a crucial role in replication-coupled chromatin assembly, cell cycle progression, and cellular viability and provide a clue of a possible role in a CAF-1- and HIRA-independent chromatin-modulating process for cell proliferation.

11793469|t|Polymorphisms and HNPCC: PMS2-MLH1 protein interactions diminished by single nucleotide polymorphisms.
11793469|t|Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is one of the most common autosomal dominant inherited diseases. Mutations in the human mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2 have been found to co-segregate with HNPCC. The MLH1 and MSH2 proteins have been demonstrated to interact with PMS1, PMS2, and MSH6 proteins. A previous study reported that missense mutations in specific regions of MLH1 can lead to defects in protein-protein interactions with PMS2. Here we report that three missense alterations previously identified as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PMS2 (P511K, T597S, and M622I) cause defective protein-protein interactions with MLH1, even though the alterations are not in the previously reported interaction domain. These results suggest that an additional domain in PMS2 affects MLH1-PMS2 interaction. This study also demonstrates that SNPs can result in gene alterations that indeed have a functional effect on protein phenotype. Thus, these three SNPs may ultimately represent variants with an increased risk factor for tumorgenesis in HNPCC. This study is one of the first to use a functional assay to appraise the role of SNPs and suggests that traditional definitions of polymorphisms and mutations are in need of reconsideration.

17704763|t|ZEITLUPE is a circadian photoreceptor stabilized by GIGANTEA in blue light.
17704763|t|The circadian clock is essential for coordinating the proper phasing of many important cellular processes. Robust cycling of key clock elements is required to maintain strong circadian oscillations of these clock-controlled outputs. Rhythmic expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein ZEITLUPE (ZTL) is necessary to sustain a normal circadian period by controlling the proteasome-dependent degradation of a central clock protein, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). ZTL messenger RNA is constitutively expressed, but ZTL protein levels oscillate with a threefold change in amplitude through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that GIGANTEA (GI) is essential to establish and sustain oscillations of ZTL by a direct protein-protein interaction. GI, a large plant-specific protein with a previously undefined molecular role, stabilizes ZTL in vivo. Furthermore, the ZTL-GI interaction is strongly and specifically enhanced by blue light, through the amino-terminal flavin-binding LIGHT, OXYGEN OR VOLTAGE (LOV) domain of ZTL. Mutations within this domain greatly diminish ZTL-GI interactions, leading to strongly reduced ZTL levels. Notably, a C82A mutation in the LOV domain, implicated in the flavin-dependent photochemistry, eliminates blue-light-enhanced binding of GI to ZTL. These data establish ZTL as a blue-light photoreceptor, which facilitates its own stability through a blue-light-enhanced GI interaction. Because the regulation of GI transcription is clock-controlled, consequent GI protein cycling confers a post-translational rhythm on ZTL protein. This mechanism of establishing and sustaining robust oscillations of ZTL results in the high-amplitude TOC1 rhythms necessary for proper clock function.

9520446|t|NF-kappaB-inducing kinase activates IKK-alpha by phosphorylation of Ser-176.
9520446|t|Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by inflammatory cytokines involves the successive action of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and two IkappaB kinases, IKK-alpha and IKK-beta. Here we show that NIK preferentially phosphorylates IKK-alpha over IKK-beta, leading to the activation of IKK-alpha kinase activity. This phosphorylation of IKK-alpha occurs specifically on Ser-176 in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII. A mutant form of IKK-alpha containing alanine at residue 176 cannot be phosphorylated or activated by NIK and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappaB activation. Conversely, a mutant form of IKK-alpha containing glutamic acid at residue 176 is constitutively active. Thus, the phosphorylation of IKK-alpha on Ser-176 by NIK may be required for cytokine-mediated NF-kappaB activation.

12434308|t|Protein Phosphatase 1 binds strongly to the retinoblastoma protein but not to p107 or p130 in vitro and in vivo.
12434308|t|PURPOSE: To identify and characterize retinoblastoma protein (pRb) binding proteins that may influence retinoblast proliferation and retinal pigment epithelial cell survival. METHODS: The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a bovine retinal cDNA library and to characterize positive clones. DNA sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis were used for further analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were used to confirm the results of the two-hybrid system in vivo. RESULTS: In the two-hybrid system, Protein Phosphatase 1alpha1 (PP1alpha1) binds the retinoblastoma protein. Unlike several other pRb binding proteins, PP1alpha1 binds only weakly to the Rb family member p107, and does not demonstrate detectable binding to p130. Confirming the two-hybrid results, endogenous PP1 in a human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous pRb but not p107 or p130. Site directed mutagenesis of two pRb binding motifs in PP1alpha1 from LXSXE to LXCXE leads to slight increases in its two-hybrid interaction with pRb but does not alter its binding preference for pRb over the other family members. The complete sequence of bovine PP1alpha1 is reported. CONCLUSIONS: The strong two-hybrid interaction between PP1alpha1 and pRb, but not p107 or p130, suggests that the phosphorylation status of members of the pRb family may be regulated by different phosphatases, contributing to fine control of cell cycle progression. Conversely, PP1 activity may be specifically regulated by pRb and not p107 or p130. Mutagenesis studies suggest that PP1alpha1's LXSXE motif is not responsible for its binding preference for pRb over p107 and p130. Disruption of the PP1-pRb interaction may influence retinoblastoma tumorigenesis as well as RPE cell proliferation and survival.

25653285|t|Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a cGMP-dependent kinase anchoring protein (GKAP) specific for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase Ib isoform.
25653285|t|Protein-protein interactions are important in providing compartmentalization and specificity in cellular signal transduction. Many studies have hallmarked the well designed compartmentalization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) through its anchoring proteins. Much less data are available on the compartmentalization of its closest homolog, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), via its own PKG anchoring proteins (GKAPs). For the enrichment, screening, and discovery of (novel) PKA anchoring proteins, a plethora of methodologies is available, including our previously described chemical proteomics approach based on immobilized cAMP or cGMP. Although this method was demonstrated to be effective, each immobilized cyclic nucleotide did not discriminate in the enrichment for either PKA or PKG and their secondary interactors. Hence, with PKG signaling components being less abundant in most tissues, it turned out to be challenging to enrich and identify GKAPs. Here we extend this cAMP-based chemical proteomics approach using competitive concentrations of free cyclic nucleotides to isolate each kinase and its secondary interactors. Using this approach, we identified Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) as a putative novel GKAP. Through sequence alignment with known GKAPs and secondary structure prediction analysis, we defined a small sequence domain mediating the interaction with PKG Ib but not PKG Ia. In vitro binding studies and site-directed mutagenesis further confirmed the specificity and affinity of HAP1 binding to the PKG Ib N terminus. These data fully support that HAP1 is a GKAP, anchoring specifically to the cGMP-dependent protein kinase isoform Ib, and provide further evidence that also PKG spatiotemporal signaling is largely controlled by anchoring proteins.

22575647|t|An autoregulatory feedback loop between Mdm2 and SHP that fine tunes Mdm2 and SHP stability.
22575647|t|Mdm2 is a crucial negative regulator of the tumor suppressor function of p53. However, little is known about Mdm2 protein stability regulation by other tumor suppressors. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NROB2) functions as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer. We show here a surprising finding of a feedback regulatory loop between SHP and Mdm2. SHP stabilizes Mdm2 protein by abrogating Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, and Mdm2 in turn attenuates SHP protein levels under p53-deficient conditions. Such cross-regulation critically depends on the physical interaction of SHP with Mdm2 through the SHP K170 residue. The Mdm2-SHP interplay represents a novel component of Mdm2 signaling that is likely to dictate Mdm2 activity and function.

16763556|t|Controlling the subcellular localization of DNA polymerases iota and eta via interactions with ubiquitin.
16763556|t|Y-family DNA polymerases have spacious active sites that can accommodate a wide variety of geometric distortions. As a consequence, they are considerably more error-prone than high-fidelity replicases. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the in vivo activity of these polymerases is tightly regulated, so as to minimize their inadvertent access to primer-termini. We report here that one such mechanism employed by human cells relies on a specific and direct interaction between DNA polymerases iota and eta with ubiquitin (Ub). Indeed, we show that both polymerases interact noncovalently with free polyUb chains, as well as mono-ubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ub-PCNA). Mutants of poliota (P692R) and poleta (H654A) were isolated that are defective in their interactions with polyUb and Ub-PCNA, whilst retaining their ability to interact with unmodified PCNA. Interestingly, the polymerase mutants exhibit significantly lower levels of replication foci in response to DNA damage, thereby highlighting the biological importance of the polymerase-Ub interaction in regulating the access of the TLS polymerases to stalled replication forks in vivo.

11604410|t|HtrA2 promotes cell death through its serine protease activity and its ability to antagonize inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.
11604410|t|Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins inhibit caspases, a function counteracted by IAP antagonists, insect Grim, HID, and Reaper and mammalian DIABLO/Smac. We now demonstrate that HtrA2, a mammalian homologue of the Escherichia coli heat shock-inducible protein HtrA, can bind to MIHA/XIAP, MIHB, and baculoviral OpIAP but not survivin. Although produced as a 50-kDa protein, HtrA2 is processed to yield an active serine protease with an N terminus similar to that of Grim, Reaper, HID, and DIABLO/Smac that mediates its interaction with XIAP. HtrA2 is largely membrane-associated in healthy cells, with a significant proportion observed within the mitochondria, but in response to UV irradiation, HtrA2 shifts into the cytosol, where it can interact with IAPs. HtrA2 can, like DIABLO/Smac, prevent XIAP inhibition of active caspase 3 in vitro and is able to counteract XIAP protection of mammalian NT2 cells against UV-induced cell death. The proapoptotic activity of HtrA2 in vivo involves both IAP binding and serine protease activity. Mutations of either the N-terminal alanine of mature HtrA2 essential for IAP interaction or the catalytic serine residue reduces the ability of HtrA2 to promote cell death, whereas a complete loss in proapoptotic activity is observed when both sites are mutated.

11713520|t|Auxin regulates SCF(TIR1)-dependent degradation of AUX/IAA proteins.
11713520|t|The plant hormone auxin is central in many aspects of plant development. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin-ligase SCF(TIR1) and the AUX/IAA proteins in auxin response. Dominant mutations in several AUX/IAA genes confer pleiotropic auxin-related phenotypes, whereas recessive mutations affecting the function of SCF(TIR1) decrease auxin response. Here we show that SCF(TIR1) is required for AUX/IAA degradation. We demonstrate that SCF(TIR1) interacts with AXR2/IAA7 and AXR3/IAA17, and that domain II of these proteins is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Further, auxin stimulates binding of SCF(TIR1) to the AUX/IAA proteins, and their degradation. Because domain II is conserved in nearly all AUX/IAA proteins in Arabidopsis, we propose that auxin promotes the degradation of this large family of transcriptional regulators, leading to diverse downstream effects.

18498651|t|The host protein Staufen1 interacts with the Pr55Gag zinc fingers and regulates HIV-1 assembly via its N-terminus.
18498651|t|BACKGROUND: The formation of new infectious human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV-1) mainly relies on the homo-multimerization of the viral structural polyprotein Pr55Gag and on the recruitment of host factors. We have previously shown that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen 1 (Stau1), likely through an interaction between its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD3) and the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Pr55Gag, participates in HIV-1 assembly by influencing Pr55Gag multimerization. RESULTS: We now report the fine mapping of Stau1/Pr55Gag association using co-immunoprecipitation and live cell bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. On the one hand, our results show that the Stau1-Pr55Gag interaction requires the integrity of at least one of the two zinc fingers in the NC domain of Pr55Gag but not that of the NC N-terminal basic region. Disruption of both zinc fingers dramatically impeded Pr55Gag multimerization and virus particle release. In parallel, we tested several Stau1 deletion mutants for their capacity to influence Pr55Gag multimerization using the Pr55Gag/Pr55Gag BRET assay in live cells. Our results revealed that a molecular determinant of 12 amino acids at the N-terminal end of Stau1 is necessary to increase Pr55Gag multimerization and particle release. However, this region is not required for Stau1 interaction with the viral polyprotein Pr55Gag. CONCLUSION: These data highlight that Stau1 is a modular protein and that Stau1 influences Pr55Gag multimerization via 1) an interaction between its dsRBD3 and Pr55Gag zinc fingers and 2) a regulatory domain within the N-terminus that could recruit host machineries that are critical for the completion of new HIV-1 capsids.

26221972|t|A polymorphism in a phosphotyrosine signalling motif of CD229 (Ly9, SLAMF3) alters SH2 domain binding and T-cell activation.
26221972|t|UNASSIGNED: Signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family members regulate activation and inhibition in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Genome-wide association studies identified their genetic locus (1q23) as highly polymorphic and associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we show that the Val602 variant of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs509749 in the SLAM family member CD229 (Ly9, SLAMF3) has a two-fold lower affinity compared with the SLE-associated Met602 variant for the small adaptor protein SAP. Comparison of the two variants in T-cell lines revealed the Val602 variant to be significantly more highly expressed than CD229 Met602 . Activation was diminished in cells expressing CD229 Val602 compared with CD229 Met602 as measured by up-regulation of CD69. There was no correlation between homozygosity at rs509749 and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. These findings identify potential mechanisms by which a single SNP can perturb fine-tuning in the immune system with significant functional consequences.

20664522|t|Phosphorylation of CLIP-170 by Plk1 and CK2 promotes timely formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments.
20664522|t|CLIP-170 is implicated in the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments through direct interaction with the dynein/dynactin complex. However, whether this important function of CLIP-170 is regulated by phosphorylation is unknown. Herein, we have identified polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2) as two kinases of CLIP-170 and mapped S195 and S1318 as their respective phosphorylation sites. We showed that a CK2 unphosphorylatable mutant lost its ability to bind to dynactin and to localize to kinetochores during prometaphase, indicating that the CK2 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is involved in its dynactin-mediated kinetochore localization. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Plk1 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 at S195 enhances its association with CK2. Finally, we detected defects in the formation of kinetochore fibres in cells expressing the CLIP-S195A and -S1318A, but not the CLIP-S195E and -S1318D, confirming that Plk1- and CK2-associated phosphorylations of CLIP-170 are involved in the timely formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments in mitosis.

21108945|t|Acetyltransferase p300 regulates NBS1-mediated DNA damage response.
21108945|t|The role of p300 in DNA damage response is unclear. To understand how ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p300 affects its function in response to DNA damage, we present evidence that S106 of p300, which is phosphorylated by ATM, regulates stability of NBS1 and recruitment into damaged DNA, possibly leading to regulation of DNA repair. Non-phosphorylatable p300 (S106A) destabilized NBS1 and decreased NBS1-p300 interaction. The recruitment of NBS1 into damaged DNA was impaired in the presence of S106A. Also, a dominant negative p300 lacking enzymatic activity induced destabilization of NBS1, suggesting that its acetyltransferase is required for NBS1 stability. These results indicate that phosphorylation of p300 can regulate NBS1-mediated DNA damage response, and that these events occur in an acetylation-dependent manner.

19185023|t|PPTX, a pentraxin domain-containing protein, interacts with the T1 domain of K v 4.
19185023|t|Voltage-gated K(+) (K(v)) channels reside as tetramers in the membrane. The events that coordinate folding, trafficking, and tetramerization are mediated by an array of associated proteins and phospholipids whose identification is vital to understanding the dynamic nature of channel expression and activity. An interaction between an A-type K(+) channel, K(v)4.2, and a protein containing a pentraxin domain (PPTX) was demonstrated in the cochlea (Duzhyy et al. [ 2005] J. Biol. Chem. 280:15165-15172). Here, we present results based on fold recognition and homology modeling that revealed the tetramerization (T1) domain of K(v)4.2 as a potential docking site for interacting proteins such as PPTX. By using this model, putative sites were experimentally tested with the yeast two-hybrid system to assay interactions between PPTX and the T1 domain of K(v)4.2 wild type (wt) and mutants (mut). Results showed that amino acid residues 86 and 118 in the T1 domain are essential for interaction, because replacing these negatively charged with neutrally charged amino acids inhibits interactions. Cotransfections of Chinese hamster ovary cells with PPTX and K(v)4.2wt further revealed that PPTX increases K(v)4.2 wt expression in vitro when analyzing total lysates, whereas interactions with K(v)4.2 microt resulted in a decrease. These studies suggest that portions of the T1 domain can act as docking sites for proteins such as PPTX, further underscoring the significance of this domain.

20158519|t|Catalytically active membrane-distal phosphatase domain of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha is required for Src activation.
20158519|t|Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPalpha) is a transmembrane protein with tandem cytoplasmic phosphatase domains. Most of the catalytic activity is contained by the membrane-proximal catalytic domain (D1). We found a spontaneous Arg554 to His mutation in the pTyr recognition loop of the membrane-distal phosphatase domain (D2) of a human patient. This mutation was not linked to the disease. Here, we report that the R554H mutation abolished RPTPalpha-D2 catalytic activity. The R554H mutation impaired Src binding to RPTPalpha. RPTPalpha, with a catalytic site cysteine to serine mutation in D2, also displayed diminished binding to Src. Concomitant with decreased Src binding of the R554H and C723S mutants compared with wild-type RPTPalpha, enhanced phosphorylation of the inhibitory Src Tyr527 site was observed, as well as reduced Src activation. To confirm that catalytic activity of RPTPalpha-D2 was required for these effects, we analyzed a third mutant, RPTPalpha-R729K, which had an inactive D2. Again, Src binding was reduced and Tyr527 phosphorylation was enhanced. Our results suggest that a catalytically active D2 is required for RPTPalpha to bind and dephosphorylate its well-characterized substrate, Src.

19644450|t|The structural basis of Arf effector specificity: the crystal structure of ARF6 in a complex with JIP4.
19644450|t|The JNK-interacting proteins, JIP3 and JIP4, are specific effectors of the small GTP-binding protein ARF6. The interaction of ARF6-GTP with the second leucine zipper (LZII) domains of JIP3/JIP4 regulates the binding of JIPs to kinesin-1 and dynactin. Here, we report the crystal structure of ARF6-GTP bound to the JIP4-LZII at 1.9 A resolution. The complex is a heterotetramer with dyad symmetry arranged in an ARF6-(JIP4)(2)-ARF6 configuration. Comparison of the ARF6-JIP4 interface with the equivalent region of ARF1 shows the structural basis of JIP4's specificity for ARF6. Using site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance, we further show that non-conserved residues at the switch region borders are the key structural determinants of JIP4 specificity. A structure-derived model of the association of the ARF6-JIP3/JIP4 complex with membranes shows that the JIP4-LZII coiled-coil should lie along the membrane to prevent steric hindrances, resulting in only one ARF6 molecule bound. Such a heterotrimeric complex gives insights to better understand the ARF6-mediated motor switch regulatory function.

23348841|t|An unusual arrangement of two 14-3-3-like domains in the SMG5-SMG7 heterodimer is required for efficient nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
23348841|t|The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway triggers the rapid degradation of aberrant mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). In metazoans, NMD requires three 14-3-3-like proteins: SMG5, SMG6, and SMG7. These proteins are recruited to PTC-containing mRNAs through the interaction of their 14-3-3-like domains with phosphorylated UPF1, the central NMD effector. Recruitment of SMG5, SMG6, and SMG7 causes NMD target degradation. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans SMG5-SMG7 complex. The 14-3-3-like phosphopeptide recognition domains of SMG5 and SMG7 heterodimerize in an unusual perpendicular back-to-back orientation in which the peptide-binding sites face opposite directions. Structure-based mutants and functional assays indicate that the SMG5-SMG7 interaction is conserved and is crucial for efficient NMD in human cells. Notably, we demonstrate that heterodimerization increases the affinity of the SMG5-SMG7 complex for UPF1. Furthermore, we show that the degradative activity of the SMG5-SMG7 complex resides in SMG7 and that the SMG5-SMG7 complex and SMG6 play partially redundant roles in the degradation of aberrant mRNAs. We propose that the SMG5-SMG7 complex binds to phosphorylated UPF1 with high affinity and recruits decay factors to the mRNA target through SMG7, thus promoting target degradation.

17462627|t|Distinct functional domains in nesprin-1alpha and nesprin-2beta bind directly to emerin and both interactions are disrupted in X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.
17462627|t|Emerin and specific isoforms of nesprin-1 and -2 are nuclear membrane proteins which are binding partners in multi-protein complexes spanning the nuclear envelope. We report here the characterisation of the residues both in emerin and in nesprin-1alpha and -2beta which are involved in their interaction and show that emerin requires nesprin-1 or -2 to retain it at the nuclear membrane. Using several protein-protein interaction methods, we show that residues 368 to 627 of nesprin-1alpha and residues 126 to 219 of nesprin-2beta, which show high homology to one another, both mediate binding to emerin residues 140-176. This region has previously been implicated in binding to F-actin, beta-catenin and lamin A/C suggesting that it is critical for emerin function. Confirmation that these protein domains interact in vivo was shown using GFP-dominant negative assays. Exogenous expression of either of these nesprin fragments in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells displaced endogenous emerin from the nuclear envelope and reduced the targeting of newly synthesised emerin. Furthermore, we are the first to report that emerin mutations which give rise to X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, disrupt binding to both nesprin-1alpha and -2beta isoforms, further indicating a role of nesprins in the pathology of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

12782684|t|Ras recruits mitotic exit regulator Lte1 to the bud cortex in budding yeast.
12782684|t|ACdc25 family protein Lte1 (low temperature essential) is essential for mitotic exit at a lowered temperature and has been presumed to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for a small GTPase Tem1, which is a key regulator of mitotic exit. We found that Lte1 physically associates with Ras2-GTP both in vivo and in vitro and that the Cdc25 homology domain (CHD) of Lte1 is essential for the interaction with Ras2. Furthermore, we found that the proper localization of Lte1 to the bud cortex is dependent on active Ras and that the overexpression of a derivative of Lte1 without the CHD suppresses defects in mitotic exit of a Deltalte1 mutant and a Deltaras1 Deltaras2 mutant. These results suggest that Lte1 is a downstream effector protein of Ras in mitotic exit and that the Ras GEF domain of Lte1 is not essential for mitotic exit but required for its localization.

22998870|t|LRRK2 controls an EndoA phosphorylation cycle in synaptic endocytosis.
22998870|t|LRRK2 is a kinase mutated in Parkinson's disease, but how the protein affects synaptic function remains enigmatic. We identified LRRK2 as a critical regulator  of EndophilinA. Using genetic and biochemical studies involving Lrrk loss-of-function mutants and Parkinson-related LRRK2(G2019S) gain-of-kinase function, we show that LRRK2 affects synaptic endocytosis by phosphorylating EndoA at S75, a residue in the BAR domain. We show that LRRK2-mediated EndoA phosphorylation has profound effects on EndoA-dependent membrane tubulation and membrane association in  vitro and in  vivo and on synaptic vesicle endocytosis at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions in  vivo. Our work uncovers a regulatory mechanism that indicates that reduced LRRK2 kinase activity facilitates EndoA membrane association, while increased kinase activity inhibits membrane association. Consequently, both too much and too little LRRK2-dependent EndoA phosphorylation impedes synaptic endocytosis, and we propose a model in which LRRK2 kinase activity is part of an EndoA phosphorylation cycle that facilitates efficient vesicle formation at synapses.

25132288|t|Identification of a Plasmodium  falciparum inhibitor-2 motif involved in the binding and regulation activity of protein phosphatase type  1.
25132288|t|The regulation of Plasmodium  falciparum protein phosphatase type  1 (PfPP1) activity remains to be deciphered. Data from homologous eukaryotic type  1 protein phosphatases (PP1) suggest that several protein regulators should be involved in this essential process. One such regulator, named PfI2 based on its primary sequence homology with eukaryotic inhibitor  2 (I2), was recently shown to be able to interact with PfPP1 and to inhibit its phosphatase activity, mainly through the canonical 'RVxF' binding motif. The details of the structural and functional characteristics of this interaction are investigated here. Using NMR spectroscopy, a second site of interaction is suggested to reside between residues D94 and T117 and contains the 'FxxR/KxR/K' binding motif present in other I2 proteins. This site seems to play in concert/synergy with the 'RVxF' motif to bind PP1, because only mutations in both motifs were able to abolish this interaction completely. However, regarding the structure/function relationship, mutation of either the 'RVxF' or 'FxxR/KxR/K' motif is more drastic, because each mutation prevents the capacity of PfI2 to trigger germinal vesicle breakdown in microinjected Xenopus oocytes. This indicates that the tight association of the PfI2 regulator to PP1, mediated by a two-site interaction, is necessary to exert its function. Based on these results, the use of a peptide derived from the 'FxxR/KxR/K' PfI2 motif was investigated for its potential effect on Plasmodium growth. This peptide, fused at its N-terminus to a penetrating sequence, was shown to accumulate specifically in infected erythrocytes and to have an antiplasmodial effect. STRUCTURED DIGITAL ABSTRACT: PfPP1 and PfI2 bind by nuclear magnetic resonance (1, 2) PP1  physically interacts with PfPP1 by anti tag coimmunoprecipitation (View interaction) PfI2  binds to PfPP1 by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (View interaction) PfI2  binds to PfPP1 by surface plasmon resonance (1, 2, 3, 4).

15901727|t|Analysis of the heteromeric CsdA-CsdE cysteine desulfurase, assisting Fe-S cluster biogenesis in Escherichia coli.
15901727|t|Biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins relies on assistance of complex machineries. To date three systems, NIF, ISC, and SUF, were reported to allow maturation of Fe-S proteins. Here we report that the csdA-csdE (formally ygdK) genes of Escherichia coli constitute a sulfur-generating system referred to as CSD which also contributes to Fe-S biogenesis in vivo. This conclusion was reached by applying a thorough combination of both in vivo and in vitro strategies and techniques. Yeast two-hybrid analysis allowed us to show that CsdA and CsdE interact. Enzymology analysis showed that CsdA cysteine desulfurase activity is increased 2-fold in the presence of CsdE. Mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenesis showed that residue Cys-61 from CsdE acted as an acceptor site for sulfur provided by cysteine desulfurase activity of CsdA. Genetic investigations revealed that the csdA-csdE genes could act as multicopy suppressors of iscS mutation. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo investigations pointed to a specific connection between the CSD system and quinolinate synthetase NadA.

15009215|t|Emerin binding to Btf, a death-promoting transcriptional repressor, is disrupted by a missense mutation that causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.
15009215|t|Loss of functional emerin, a nuclear membrane protein, causes X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that emerin interacts with Btf, a death-promoting transcriptional repressor, which is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle. Biochemical analysis showed that emerin binds Btf with an equilibrium affinity (KD) of 100 nm. Using a collection of 21 clustered alanine-substitution mutations in emerin, the residues required for binding to Btf mapped to two regions of emerin that flank its lamin-binding domain. Two disease-causing mutations in emerin, S54F and Delta95-99, disrupted binding to Btf. The Delta95-99 mutation was relatively uninformative, as this mutation also disrupts emerin binding to lamin A and a different transcription repressor named germ cell-less (GCL). In striking contrast, emerin mutant S54F, which binds normally to barrier-to-autointegration factor, lamin A and GCL, selectively disrupted emerin binding to Btf. We localized endogenous Btf in HeLa cells by indirect immunoflurorescence using affinity-purified antibodies against Btf. In nonapoptotic HeLa cells Btf was found in dot-like structures throughout the nuclear interior. However, within 3 h after treating cells with Fas antibody to induce apoptosis, the distribution of Btf changed, and Btf concentrated in a distinct zone near the nuclear envelope. These results suggest that Btf localization is regulated by apoptotic signals, and that loss of emerin binding to Btf may be relevant to muscle wasting in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

24256567|t|Insights into the suppressor of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-1 (Sts-1)-mediated regulation of TCR signaling through the use of novel substrate-trapping Sts-1 phosphatase variants.
24256567|t|High affinity substrate-trapping protein tyrosine phosphatases have been widely used both to investigate the endogenous targets of many phosphatases and to address questions of substrate specificity. Herein, we extend the concept of a substrate-trapping phosphatase to include an enzyme of the histidine phosphatase superfamily. This is the first description of substrate-trapping technology applied to a member of the histidine phosphatase family. The phosphatase suppressor of T-cell receptor signaling (Sts)-1 has recently been reported to negatively regulate signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor. We generated high-affinity substrate-trapping variants of Sts-1 by mutagenesis of key active site residues within the phosphatase catalytic domain. Mutation of both the nucleophilic His380 and the general acid Glu490 yielded Sts-1 enzymes that were catalytically inactive but showed high affinity for an important tyrosine kinase in T cells that Sts-1 is known to regulate, Zap-70. Sts-1 substrate-trapping mutants isolated tyrosine-phosphorylated Zap-70 from lysates of activated T cells, validating Zap-70 as a possible substrate for Sts-1 and highlighting the efficacy of the mutants as substrate-trapping agents. Inhibition of the Zap-70 interaction by vanadate suggests that the substrate-trapping effect occurred via the Sts-1 phosphatase active site. Finally, overexpression of Sts-1 substrate-trapping mutants in T cells blocked T-cell receptor signaling, confirming the inhibitory effect of Sts-1 on Zap-70.

22404908|t|Effect of cancer-associated mutations in the PlexinB1 gene.
22404908|t|BACKGROUND: Semaphorins act as chemotactic cues for cell movement via their transmembrane receptors, plexins. Somatic missense mutations in the plexinB1 gene coupled with overexpression of the protein frequently occur in prostate tumours, indicating a role for plexinB1 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Two specific mutations found in prostate cancer enhance RhoD binding and one other mutation results in loss of inhibition of Rac-dependent Pak1 phosphorylation and lamellipodia formation and in impairment of trafficking of plexinB1 to the membrane. None of the three characterised mutations affect PDZRhoGEF binding, RhoA activity, the interaction of plexinB1 with the oncogenes ErbB2 or c-Met or ErbB2 phosphorylation. The mutations have the net effect of increasing cell motility by blocking plexinB1-mediated inhibition of Rac while enhancing the interaction with RhoD, an anti-migratory factor. CONCLUSIONS: PlexinB1 mutations block plexinB1-mediated signalling pathways that inhibit cell motility.

7629138|t|Differential interactions of human Sos1 and Sos2 with Grb2.
7629138|t|The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless (Sos) performs a crucial step in the coupling of receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras activation. Mammalian cells contain two related but distinct Sos proteins, Sos1 and Sos2. Although they share a high degree of overall similarity, it is not known to what extent their biological and biochemical properties overlap. In the present study, we have compared the interactions of the two human homologues of Sos, hSos1 and hSos2, with the adaptor protein Grb2. We show that hSos2 interacts with Grb2 via its proline-rich COOH-terminal domain and that this interaction is dependent on the SH3 domains of Grb2. In general, these characteristics are similar to the ones reported previously for the interaction of hSos1 with Grb2. However, the apparent binding affinity of hSos2 for Grb2 is significantly higher relative to that of hSos1 both in vitro and in vivo. The region conferring this higher binding affinity has been mapped to residues 1126-1242 of the hSos2 COOH-terminal domain. These results suggest that Sos1 and Sos2 may differentially contribute to receptor-mediated Ras activation.

11846417|t|Titin mutations as the molecular basis for dilated cardiomyopathy.
11846417|t|Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heterogeneous cardiac disease characterized by ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in genes for cardiac sarcomere components lead to DCM. The cardiac sarcomere consists of thick and thin filaments and a giant protein, titin. Because one of the loci of familial DCM was mapped to the region of the titin gene, we searched for titin mutations in the patients and identified four possible disease-associated mutations. Two mutations, Val54Met and Ala743Val, were found in the Z-line region of titin and decreased binding affinities of titin to Z-line proteins T-cap/telethonin and alpha-actinin, respectively, in yeast two-hybrid assays. The other two mutations were found in the cardiac-specific N2-B region of titin and one of them was a nonsense mutation, Glu4053ter, presumably encoding for a truncated nonfunctional molecule. These observations suggest that titin mutations may cause DCM in a subset of the patients.

10675328|t|Induction of apoptosis by Drosophila reaper, hid and grim through inhibition of IAP function.
10675328|t|Induction of apoptosis in Drosophila requires the activity of three closely linked genes, reaper, hid and grim. Here we show that the proteins encoded by reaper, hid and grim activate cell death by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic activity of the Drosophila IAP1 (diap1) protein. In a genetic modifier screen, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles in the endogenous diap1 gene were obtained, and the mutant proteins were functionally and biochemically characterized. Gain-of-function mutations in diap1 strongly suppressed reaper-, hid- and grim-induced apoptosis. Sequence analysis of these alleles revealed that they were caused by single amino acid changes in the baculovirus IAP repeat domains of diap1, a domain implicated in binding REAPER, HID and GRIM. Significantly, the corresponding mutant DIAP1 proteins displayed greatly reduced binding of REAPER, HID and GRIM, indicating that REAPER, HID and GRIM kill by forming a complex with DIAP1. These data provide strong in vivo evidence for a previously published model of cell death regulation in Drosophila.

21586138|t|Possible role of death receptor-mediated apoptosis by the E3 ubiquitin ligases Siah2 and POSH.
21586138|t|BACKGROUND: A functioning ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is essential for a number of diverse cellular processes and maintenance of overall cellular homeostasis. The ability of proteasome inhibitors, such as Velcade, to promote extrinsic apoptotic effects illustrates the importance of the ubiquitin proteasome system in the regulation of death receptor signaling. Here, we set out to define the UPS machinery, particularly the E3 ubiquitin ligases, that repress apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. A cell-based genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA screen was established to monitor caspase-8 activity following the addition of TRAIL. RESULTS: Data from the high-throughput screen revealed that targeting the RING-finger containing E3 ligase Siah2 as well as the signaling platform molecule POSH (SH3RF1) conferred robust caspase-8 activation in response to TRAIL stimulus. Silencing Siah2 or POSH in prostate cancer cells led to increased caspase activity and apoptosis in response to both TRAIL and Fas ligand. The E3 activity of Siah2 was responsible for mediating apoptosis resistance; while POSH protein levels were critical for maintaining viability. Further characterization of Siah2 revealed it to function downstream of early death receptor events in the apoptotic pathway. The observed apoptosis resistance provides one biological explanation for the induction of Siah2 and POSH reported in lung and prostate cancer, respectively. Expanding on an initial yeast-two-hybrid screen we have confirmed a physical interaction between E3 ligases Siah2 and POSH. Utilizing a yeast-two-hybrid mapping approach we have defined the spacer region of POSH, more specifically the RPxAxVxP motif encompassing amino acids 601-607, to be the site of Siah2 binding. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here define POSH and Siah2 as important mediators of death receptor mediated apoptosis and suggest targeting the interaction of these two E3 ligases is a promising novel cancer therapeutic strategy.

16103886|t|The hScrib/Dlg apico-basal control complex is differentially targeted by HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 proteins.
16103886|t|The E6 proteins of the high-risk Human papillomaviruses (HPV) types have a well-documented ability to target certain cellular proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the proteasome. Previous studies have shown that E6 proteins interact differently with different target proteins, and that the viral proteins, depending upon the target, may recruit diverse cellular ubiquitin-protein ligases. In this study, we have examined the abilities of E6 proteins from HPV-16 and HPV-18 to interact with and induce the degradation of two PDZ domain-containing targets, Dlg and hScrib. We have also mapped the binding site of E6 on hScrib and shown that the interaction of E6 with hScrib is distinct from its interactions with other PDZ domain-containing targets. This is reflected in the efficiency with which the two viral E6 proteins can inhibit hScrib's suppression of cell transformation.Dlg and hScrib have complementary activities in the control of epithelial cell polarity and the fact that both are targeted by high-risk HPV E6 proteins underlines their importance. Our finding that they are each targeted differently by HPV-16 and HPV-18 E 6 s suggests that the two viruses are subjected to somewhat different constraints and provides a possible explanation for the apparent redundancy in targeting both parts of this important control mechanism.

16766694|t|Analysis of the Arabidopsis rsr4-1/pdx1-3 mutant reveals the critical function of the PDX1 protein family in metabolism, development, and vitamin B6 biosynthesis.
16766694|t|Vitamin B6 represents a highly important group of compounds ubiquitous in all living organisms. It has been demonstrated to alleviate oxidative stress and in its phosphorylated form participates as a cofactor in >100 biochemical reactions. By means of a genetic approach, we have identified a novel mutant, rsr4-1 (for reduced sugar response), with aberrant root and leaf growth that requires supplementation of vitamin B6 for normal development. Cloning of the mutated gene revealed that rsr4-1 carries a point mutation in a member of the PDX1/SOR1/SNZ (for Pyridoxine biosynthesis protein 1/Singlet oxygen resistant 1/Snooze) family that leads to reduced vitamin B6 content. Consequently, metabolism is broadly altered, mainly affecting amino acid, raffinose, and shikimate contents and trichloroacetic acid cycle constituents. Yeast two-hybrid and pull-down analyses showed that Arabidopsis thaliana PDX1 proteins can form oligomers. Interestingly, the mutant form of PDX1 has severely reduced capability to oligomerize, potentially suggesting that oligomerization is important for function. In summary, our results demonstrate the critical function of the PDX1 protein family for metabolism, whole-plant development, and vitamin B6 biosynthesis in higher plants.

18769030|t|The RCC1 domain of protein associated with Myc (PAM) interacts with and regulates KCC2.
18769030|t|GABAergic and glycinergic function is dependent on neuronal intracellular chloride. The neuron-specific electroneutral potassium (K(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) cotransporter (KCC2), is a key regulator of neuronal Cl(-), yet little is known about KCC2 regulation. Using yeast two-hybrid, we identified Protein Associated with Myc (PAM) as a binding partner of KCC2. The RCC1 (Regulator of Chromatin Condensation) domain of PAM binds to the carboxyl terminus of KCC2, as demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull-down assays. RCC1/PAM and full-length KCC2 coimmunoprecipitate following heterologous co-expression in HEK293 cells. Additionally, (86)Rb/K(+) uptake assays in this model system show that RCC1/PAM causes increased KCC2-mediated flux. After narrowing down RCC1/PAM binding to a 20 amino acid region on the KCC2 carboxyl terminus, we created a point mutant in this region to eliminate interaction between the KCC2 carboxyl terminus and RCC1/PAM. This same mutation abolishes N-ethylmaleimide activation of KCC2, suggesting that PAM plays a role in modulating KCC2 function.

15171681|t|Heterodimeric interaction and interfaces of S100A1 and S100P.
15171681|t|With the widespread use of yeast two-hybrid systems, many heterodimeric forms of S100 proteins have been found, although their biological significance is unknown. In the present study, S100A1 was found to interact with another S100 protein, S100P, by using the yeast two-hybrid system. The binding parameters of the interaction were obtained using an optical biosensor and show that S100P has a slightly higher affinity for S100A1 (K(d)=10-20 nM) when compared with that for self-association (K(d)=40-120 nM). The physical interaction of S100A1 and S100P was also demonstrated in living mammalian cells using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. Preincubation of recombinant S100P with S100A1, before the biosensor assay, reduced by up to 50% the binding of S100P to a recombinant C-terminal fragment of non-muscle myosin A, one of its target molecules. Site-specific mutations of S100P and S100A1, combined with homology modelling of an S100P/S100A1 heterodimer using known S100P and S100A1 structures, allowed the hydrophobic interactions at the dimeric interface of the heterodimer to be defined and provide an explanation for the heterodimerization of S100P and S100A1 at the molecular level. These results have revealed the similarities and the differences between the S100P homodimer and the S100A1/S100P heterodimer.

16963558|t|Influenza A virus NS1 protein binds p85beta and activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling.
16963558|t|Influenza A virus NS1 is a multifunctional protein, and in virus-infected cells NS1 modulates a number of host-cell processes by interacting with cellular factors. Here, we report that NS1 binds directly to p85beta, a regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), but not to the related p85alpha subunit. Activation of PI3K in influenza virus-infected cells depended on genome replication, and showed kinetics that correlated with NS1 expression. Additionally, it was found that expression of NS1 alone was sufficient to constitutively activate PI3K, causing the phosphorylation of a downstream mediator of PI3K signal transduction, Akt. Mutational analysis of a potential SH2-binding motif within NS1 indicated that the highly conserved tyrosine at residue 89 is important for both the interaction with p85beta, and the activation of PI3K. A mutant influenza virus (A/Udorn/72) expressing NS1 with the Y89F amino acid substitution exhibited a small-plaque phenotype, and grew more slowly in tissue culture than WT virus. These data suggest that activation of PI3K signaling in influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus replication.

12612071|t|Dominant negative dimerization of a mutant homeodomain protein in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.
12612071|t|Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the PITX2 homeodomain protein. We have studied the mechanism underlying the dominant negative K88E mutation, which occurs at position 50 of the homeodomain. By using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pulldown assays, we have documented that PITX2a can form homodimers in the absence of DNA. Moreover, the K88E mutant had even stronger dimerization ability, primarily due to interactions involving the C-terminal region. Dimerization allowed cooperative binding of wild-type (WT) PITX2a to DNA containing tandem bicoid sites in a head-to-tail orientation (Hill coefficient, 1.73). In contrast, the WT-K88E heterodimer bound the tandem sites with greatly reduced cooperativity and decreased transactivation activity. To further explore the role of position 50 in PITX2a dimerization, we introduced a charge-conservative mutation of lysine to arginine (K88R). The K88R protein had greatly reduced binding to a TAATCC element and did not specifically bind any other TAATNN motif. Like K88E, K88R formed relatively stronger dimers with WT. As predicted by our model, the K88R protein acted in a dominant negative manner to suppress WT PITX2a activity. These results suggest that the position 50 residue in the PITX2 homeodomain plays an important role in both DNA binding and dimerization activities.

25040622|t|Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein  1 inhibition of T-cell receptor signaling depends on its SH3 domain.
25040622|t|Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) is an adaptor protein associated with the cytoskeleton that is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause the rare autoinflammatory disease called pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne. We carried out this study to further our knowledge on PSTPIP1 function in T cells, particularly in relation to the phosphatase lymphoid phosphatase (LYP), which is involved in several autoimmune diseases. LYP-PSTPIP1 binding occurs through the C-terminal homology domain of LYP and the F-BAR domain of PSTPIP1. PSTPIP1 inhibits T-cell activation upon T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 engagement, regardless of CD2 costimulation. This function of PSTPIP1 depends on the presence of an intact SH3 domain rather than on the F-BAR domain, indicating that ligands of the F-BAR domain, such as the PEST phosphatases LYP and PTP-PEST, are not critical for its negative regulatory role in TCR signaling. Additionally, PSTPIP1 mutations that cause the pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne syndrome do not affect PSTPIP1 function in T-cell activation through the TCR.

17906639|t|The prolyl isomerase Pin1 orchestrates p53 acetylation and dissociation from the apoptosis inhibitor iASPP.
17906639|t|The tumor-suppressor function of p53 relies on its transcriptional activity, which is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with regulatory proteins. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 has a central role in transducing phosphorylation of p53 into conformational changes that affect p53 stability and function. We found that Pin1 is required for efficient loading of p53 on target promoters upon stress. In addition, Pin1 is recruited to chromatin by p53 and stimulates binding of the p300 acetyltransferase and consequent p53 acetylation. Accordingly, tumor-associated mutations at Pin1-binding residues within the p53 proline-rich domain hamper acetylation of p53 by p300. After phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 triggered by cytotoxic stimuli, Pin1 also mediates p53's dissociation from the apoptosis inhibitor iASPP, promoting cell death. In tumors bearing wild-type p53, expression of Pin1 and iASPP are inversely correlated, supporting the clinical relevance of these interactions.

18067539|t|Different regions of Mlc and NagC, homologous transcriptional repressors controlling expression of the glucose and N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase systems in Escherichia coli, are required for inducer signal recognition.
18067539|t|Mlc and NagC are two homologous transcription factors which bind to similar DNA targets but for which the inducing signals and mechanisms of activation are very different. Displacing Mlc from its DNA binding sites necessitates its sequestration to the inner membrane via an interaction with PtsG (EIICB(Glc)), while NagC is displaced from its DNA targets by interacting with GlcNAc6P. We have isolated mutations in both proteins which prevent the inactivation of the repressors by growth on glucose or GlcNAc. These mutations are located in different and specific regions of each protein. For Mlc changes at the C-terminal make it a constitutive repressor and also prevent it from binding to EIIB(Glc). Mutations in NagC, at positions which form a structural motif resembling a glucose binding site in Mlc, produce permanently repressing forms of NagC, suggesting that this motif forms a GlcNAc6P binding site in NagC. The pattern of repression by chimeric proteins of NagC and Mlc confirms the importance of the C-terminal region of Mlc for both repression and inducer binding and demonstrate that the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif is not sufficient to determine the specificity of interaction of the repressor with DNA.

12679424|t|A novel T608R missense mutation in insulin receptor substrate-1 identified in a subject with type 2 diabetes impairs metabolic insulin signaling.
12679424|t|Naturally occurring mutations in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) have previously been implicated in impaired insulin action. We now report a novel mutation in IRS-1 with substitution of Arg for Thr(608) that was identified in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We detected the T608R mutation in 1 of 136 chromosomes from diabetic patients and in 0 of 120 chromosomes from nondiabetic controls, suggesting that this is a rare IRS-1 variant. Conservation of Thr(608) in human, monkey, rat, mouse, and chicken IRS-1 sequences is consistent with a crucial function for this residue. Moreover, Thr(608) is located near the YMXM motif containing Tyr(612) that is important for binding and activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). To investigate whether the T608R mutation impairs insulin signaling, we transiently transfected NIH-3T3(IR) cells with hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type or T608R mutant IRS-1 constructs. Recombinant IRS-1 immunoprecipitated from transfected cells treated with or without insulin was subjected to immunoblotting for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase as well as a PI 3-kinase assay. As expected, in control cells transfected with wild-type IRS-1, insulin stimulation caused an increase in p85 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS-1 as well as a 10-fold increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Interestingly, when cells transfected with IRS1-T608R were stimulated with insulin, both the amount of p85 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1-T608R as well as the associated PI 3-kinase activity were approximately 50% less than those observed with wild-type IRS-1. Moreover, in rat adipose cells, overexpression of IRS1-T608R resulted in significantly less translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface than comparable overexpression of wild-type IRS-1. We conclude that a naturally occurring substitution of Arg for Thr(608) in IRS-1 is a rare human mutation that may contribute to insulin resistance by impairing metabolic signaling through PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways.

17545281|t|Protein modulator of multidrug efflux gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
17545281|t|nalC multidrug-resistant mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa show enhanced expression of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux system as a direct result of the production of a ca. 6,100-Da protein, PA3719, in these mutants. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, PA3719 was shown to interact in vivo with MexR, a repressor of mexAB-oprM expression. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies confirmed a high-affinity interaction (equilibrium dissociation constant [K(D)], 158.0 +/- 18.1 nM) of PA3719 with MexR in vitro. PA3719 binding to and formation of a complex with MexR obviated repressor binding to its operator, which overlaps the efflux operon promoter, suggesting that mexAB-oprM hyperexpression in nalC mutants results from PA3719 modulation of MexR repressor activity. Consistent with this, MexR repression of mexA transcription in an in vitro transcription assay was alleviated by PA3719. Mutations in MexR compromising its interaction with PA3719 in vivo were isolated and shown to be located internally and distributed throughout the protein, suggesting that they impacted PA3719 binding by altering MexR structure or conformation rather than by having residues interacting specifically with PA3719. Four of six mutant MexR proteins studied retained repressor activity even in a nalC strain producing PA3719. Again, this is consistent with a PA3719 interaction with MexR being necessary to obviate MexR repressor activity. The gene encoding PA3719 has thus been renamed armR (antirepressor for MexR). A representative "noninteracting" mutant MexR protein, MexR(I104F), was purified, and ITC confirmed that it bound PA3719 with reduced affinity (5.4-fold reduced; K(D), 853.2 +/- 151.1 nM). Consistent with this, MexR(I104F) repressor activity, as assessed using the in vitro transcription assay, was only weakly compromised by PA3719. Finally, two mutations (L36P and W45A) in ArmR compromising its interaction with MexR have been isolated and mapped to a putative C-terminal alpha-helix of the protein that alone is sufficient for interaction with MexR.

23584531|t|Structural insights into oligomerization and mitochondrial remodelling of dynamin 1-like protein.
23584531|t|Dynamin 1-like protein (DNM1L) mediates fission of mitochondria and peroxisomes, and dysfunction of DNM1L has been implicated in several neurological disorders. To study the molecular basis of mitochondrial remodelling, we determined the crystal structure of DNM1L that is comprised of a G domain, a bundle signalling element and a stalk. DNM1L assembled via a central stalk interface, and mutations in this interface disrupted dimerization and interfered with membrane binding and mitochondrial targeting. Two sequence stretches at the tip of the stalk were shown to be required for ordered assembly of DNM1L on membranes and its function in mitochondrial fission. In the crystals, DNM1L dimers further assembled via a second, previously undescribed, stalk interface to form a linear filament. Mutations in this interface interfered with liposome tubulation and mitochondrial remodelling. Based on these results and electron microscopy reconstructions, we propose an oligomerization mode for DNM1L which differs from that of dynamin and might be adapted to the remodelling of mitochondria.

10488108|t|The RING finger motif of photomorphogenic repressor COP1 specifically interacts with the RING-H2 motif of a novel Arabidopsis protein.
10488108|t|The constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) protein of Arabidopsis functions as a molecular switch for the seedling developmental fates: photomorphogenesis under light conditions and skotomorphogenesis in darkness. The COP1 protein contains a cysteine-rich zinc-binding RING finger motif found in diverse groups of regulatory proteins. To understand the role of the COP1 RING finger in mediating protein-protein interaction, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and isolated a novel protein with a RING-H2 motif, a variant type of the RING finger. This protein, designated COP1 Interacting Protein 8 (CIP8), is encoded by a single copy gene and localized to cytosol in a transient assay. In addition to the RING-H2 motif, the predicted protein has a C4 zinc finger, an acidic region, a glycine-rich cluster, and a serine-rich cluster. The COP1 RING finger and the CIP8 RING-H2 domains are sufficient for their interaction with each other both in vitro and in yeast, whereas neither motif displayed significant self-association. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the expected zinc-binding ligands of the RING finger and RING-H2 fingers are essential for their interaction. Our findings indicate that the RING finger motif, in this case, serves as autonomous protein-protein interaction domain. The allele specific effect of cop1 mutations on the CIP8 protein accumulation in seedlings indicates that its stability in vivo is dependent on the COP1 protein.

19013157|t|Features of a twin-arginine signal peptide required for recognition by a Tat proofreading chaperone.
19013157|t|The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system is a bacterial protein targeting pathway. Tat-targeted proteins display signal peptides containing a distinctive SRRxFLK 'twin-arginine' motif. The Escherichia coli trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) bears a bifunctional Tat signal peptide, which directs protein export and serves as a binding site for the TorD biosynthetic chaperone. Here, the physical interaction between TorD and the TorA signal peptide was investigated. A single substitution within the TorA signal peptide (L31Q) was sufficient to impair TorD binding. Screening of a random torD mutant library identified a variant TorD protein (Q7L) that displayed increased binding affinity for the TorA signal peptide.

20693326|t|Conserved motifs involved in ATP hydrolysis by MalT, a signal transduction ATPase with numerous domains from Escherichia coli.
20693326|t|The signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) are sophisticated signaling proteins that are related to AAA+ proteins and control various biological processes, including apoptosis, gene expression, and innate immunity. They function as tightly regulated switches, with the off and on positions corresponding to an ADP-bound, monomeric form and an ATP-bound, multimeric form, respectively. Protein activation is triggered by inducer binding to the sensor domain. ATP hydrolysis by the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) ensures the generation of the ADP-bound form. Here, we use MalT, an Escherichia coli transcription activator, as a model system to identify STAND conserved motifs involved in ATP hydrolysis besides the catalytic acidic residue. Alanine substitution of the conserved polar residue (H131) that is located two residues downstream from the catalytic residue (D129) blocks ATP hydrolysis and traps MalT in an active, ATP-bound, multimeric form. This polar residue is also conserved in AAA+. Based on AAA+ X-ray structures, we proposed that it is responsible for the proper positioning of the catalytic and the sensor I residues for the hydrolytic attack. Alanine substitution of the putative STAND sensor I (R160) abolished MalT activity. Substitutions of R171 impaired both ATP hydrolysis and multimerization, which is consistent with an arginine finger function and provides further evidence that ATP hydrolysis is primarily catalyzed by MalT multimers.

12802020|t|TSG101 interaction with HRS mediates endosomal trafficking and receptor down-regulation.
12802020|t|Down-regulation of mitogenic signaling in mammalian cells relies in part on endosomal trafficking of activated receptors into lysosomes, where the receptors are degraded. These events are mediated by ubiquitination of the endosomal cargo and its consequent sorting into multivesicular bodies that form at the surfaces of late endosomes. Tumor susceptibility gene 101 (tsg101) recently was found to be centrally involved in this process. Here we report that TSG101 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), an early endosomal protein, and that disruption of this interaction impedes endosomal trafficking and endocytosis-mediated degradation of mitogenic receptors. TSG101/HRS interaction occurs between a ubiquitin-binding domain of TSG101 and two distinct proline-rich regions of HRS, and is modulated by a C-terminal TSG101 sequence that resembles a motif targeted in HRS. Mutational perturbation of TSG101/HRS interaction prevented delivery of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to late endosomes, resulted in the cellular accumulation of ubiquitinated EGFR in early endosomes, and inhibited ligand-induced down-regulation of EGFR. Our results reveal the TSG101 interaction with HRS as a crucial step in endocytic down-regulation of mitogenic signaling and suggest a role for this interaction in linking the functions of early and late endosomes.

19632990|t|Synergy between ficolin-2 and pentraxin 3 boosts innate immune recognition and complement deposition.
19632990|t|The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multifunctional soluble pattern recognition molecule that is crucial in innate immune protection against opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus. The mechanisms that mediate downstream effects of PTX3 are largely unknown. However, PTX3 interacts with C1q from the classical pathway of the complement. The ficolins are recognition molecules of the lectin complement pathway sharing structural and functional characteristics with C1q. Thus, we investigated whether the ficolins (Ficolin-1, -2, and -3) interact with PTX3 and whether the complexes are able to modulate complement activation on A. fumigatus. Ficolin-2 could be affinity-isolated from human plasma on immobilized PTX3. In binding studies, Ficolin-1 and particularly Ficolin-2 interacted with PTX3 in a calcium-independent manner. Ficolin-2, but not Ficolin-1 and Ficolin-3, bound A. fumigatus directly, but this binding was enhanced by PTX3 and vice versa. Ficolin-2-dependent complement deposition on the surface of A. fumigatus was enhanced by PTX3. A polymorphism in the FCN2 gene causing a T236M amino acid change in the fibrinogen-like binding domain of Ficolin-2, which affects the binding to GlcNAc, reduced Ficolin-2 binding to PTX3 and A. fumigatus significantly. These results demonstrate that PTX3 and Ficolin-2 may recruit each other on pathogens. The effect was alleviated by a common amino acid change in the fibrinogen-like domain of Ficolin-2. Thus, components of the humoral innate immune system, which activate different complement pathways, cooperate and amplify microbial recognition and effector functions.

12084722|t|Naturally occurring mutations in the largest extracellular loops of ABCA1 can disrupt its direct interaction with apolipoprotein A-I.
12084722|t|The ABCA1 transporter contains two large domains into which many of the genetic mutations in individuals with Tangier disease fall. To investigate the structural requirements for the cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1, we have determined the topology of these two domains and generated transporters harboring five naturally occurring missense mutations in them. These mutants, unlike wild type ABCA1, produced little or no apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux when transfected into 293 cells, establishing their causality in Tangier disease. Because all five mutant proteins were well expressed and detectable on the plasma membrane, their interaction with the ABCA1 ligand, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, was measured using bifunctional cross-linking agents. Four of five mutants had a marked decline in cross-linking to apoA-I, whereas one (W590S) retained full cross-linking activity. Cross-linking of apoA-I was temperature-dependent, rapid in onset, and detectable with both lipid- and water-soluble cross-linking agents. These results suggest that apoA-I-stimulated cholesterol efflux cannot occur without a direct interaction between the apoprotein and critical residues in two extracellular loops of ABCA1. The behavior of the W590S mutant indicates that although binding of apoA-I by ABCA1 may be necessary, it is not sufficient for stimulation of cholesterol efflux.

18775314|t|Molecular basis for the sorting of the SNARE VAMP7 into endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles by the ArfGAP Hrb.
18775314|t|SNAREs provide the specificity and energy for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane, but how they are sorted into the appropriate vesicles on post-Golgi trafficking pathways is largely unknown. We demonstrate that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the SNARE VAMP7 is directly mediated by Hrb, a clathrin adaptor and ArfGAP. Hrb wraps 20 residues of its unstructured C-terminal tail around the folded VAMP7 longin domain, demonstrating that unstructured regions of clathrin adaptors can select cargo. Disrupting this interaction by mutation of the VAMP7 longin domain or depletion of Hrb causes VAMP7 to accumulate on the cell's surface. However, the SNARE helix of VAMP7 binds back onto its longin domain, outcompeting Hrb for binding to the same groove and suggesting that Hrb-mediated endocytosis of VAMP7 occurs only when VAMP7 is incorporated into a cis-SNARE complex. These results elucidate the mechanism of retrieval of a postfusion SNARE complex in clathrin-coated vesicles.
